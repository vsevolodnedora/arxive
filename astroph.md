title: Rapid radio brightening of GRB 210702A

topic: We observed the rapid radio brightening of GRB 210702A with the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) just 11hr post-burst, tracking early-time radio variability over a 5hr period on 15min timescales at 9.0, 16.7, and 21.2GHz. A broken power-law fit to the 9.0GHz light curve showed that the 5hr flare peaked at a flux density of 0.4+/-0.1mJy at 13hr post-burst with a steep rise and decline. The observed temporal and spectral evolution are not expected in the standard internal-external shock model, where forward and reverse shock radio emission evolves on much longer timescales. The early-time (less 1day) optical and X-ray light curves from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory demonstrated typical afterglow forward shock behaviour, allowing us to use blast wave physics to determine a likely homogeneous circumburst medium and an emitting electron population power-law index of p=2.9+/-0.1. We suggest the early-time radio flare is likely due to weak interstellar scintillation (ISS), which boosted the radio afterglow emission above the ATCA sensitivity limit on minute timescales. Using weak ISS relations, we were able to place an upper limit on the size of the blast wave of ≤6×1016cm in the plane of the sky, which is consistent with the theoretical forward shock size prediction of 8x1016cm for GRB 210702A at 13h post-burst. This represents the earliest ISS size constraint on a GRB blast wave to date, demonstrating the importance of rapid (less 1day) radio follow-up of GRBs using several-hour integrations to capture the early afterglow evolution, and to track scintillation over a broad frequency range.

title: How does dark matter affect compact star properties and high density constraints of strongly interacting matter
authors: Violetta Sagun, Edoardo Giangrandi, Oleksii Ivanytskyi, Costança Providência, Tim Dietrich
topic: We study the impact of asymmetric bosonic dark matter on neutron star properties, including possible changes of tidal deformability, maximum mass, radius, and matter distribution inside the star. The conditions at which dark matter particles tend to condensate in the star's core or create an extended halo are presented. We show that dark matter condensed in a core leads to a decrease of the total gravitational mass and tidal deformability compared to a pure baryonic star, which we will perceive as an effective softening of the equation of state. On the other hand, the presence of a dark matter halo increases those observable quantities. Thus, observational data on compact stars could be affected by accumulated dark matter and, consequently, constraints we put on strongly interacting matter at high densities. To confirm the presence of dark matter in the compact star's interior, and to break the degeneracy between the effect of accumulated dark matter and strongly interacting matter properties at high densities, several astrophysical and GW tests are proposed.

title: Jet-environment interplay in magnetized binary neutron star mergers
authors: Andrea Pavan, Riccardo Ciolfi, Jay Vijay Kalinani, Andrea Mignone
topic: GRB 170817A, the first short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) to be detected in coincidence with a gravitational wave signal, demonstrated that merging binary neutron star (BNS) systems can power collimated ultra-relativistic jets and, in turn, produce sGRBs. Moreover, it revealed that sGRB jets possess an intrinsic angular structure that is imprinted in the observable prompt and afterglow emission. Advanced numerical simulations represent the leading approach to investigate the physical processes underlying the evolution of sGRB jets breaking out of post-merger environments, and thus connect the final angular structure and energetics with specific jet launching conditions. In a previous paper, we carried out the first three-dimensional (3D) special-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of incipient (top-hat) sGRB jets propagating across the realistic environment resulting from a general-relativistic (GR) hydrodynamic BNS merger simulation. While the above work marked an important step toward a consistent end-to-end description of sGRB jets from BNS mergers, those simulations did not account for the presence of magnetic fields, which are expected to play a key role. Here, we overcome this limitation, reporting the first 3D special-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a magnetized (structured and rotating) sGRB jet piercing through a realistic magnetized post-merger environment, wherein the initial conditions of the latter are directly imported from the outcome of a previous GR-MHD BNS merger simulation.

topic: We present a detailed prompt emission and early optical afterglow analysis of the two very high energy (VHE) detected bursts GRB 201015A and GRB 201216C, and their comparison with a subset of similar bursts. Time-resolved spectral analysis of multi-structured GRB 201216C using the Bayesian binning algorithm revealed that during the entire duration of the burst, the low energy spectral index (alpha-pt) remained below the limit of the synchrotron line of death. However, statistically some of the bins supported the additional thermal component. Additionally, the evolution of spectral parameters showed that both peak energy (Ep) and alpha-pt tracked the flux. These results were further strengthened using the values of the physical parameters obtained by synchrotron modeling of the data. Our earliest optical observations of both bursts using FRAM-ORM and BOOTES robotic telescopes displayed a smooth bump in their early optical light curves, consistent with the onset of the afterglow due to synchrotron emission from an external forward shock. Using the observed optical peak, we constrained the initial bulk Lorentz factors of GRB 201015A and GRB 201216C to Gamma-0 = 204 and Gamma-0 = 310, respectively. The present early optical observations are the earliest known observations constraining outflow parameters and our analysis indicate that VHE-detected bursts could have a diverse range of observed luminosity within the detectable redshift range of present VHE facilities.

title: The role of the magnetic fields in GRB outflows

topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are bright extragalactic flashes of gamma-ray radiation and briefly the most energetic explosions in the Universe. Their catastrophic origin (the merger of compact objects or the collapse of massive stars) drives the formation of a newborn compact remnant (black hole or magnetar) that powers two highly relativistic jets. To distinguish between magnetized and baryonic jet models and ultimately determine the power source for these energetic explosions, our team studies the polarization of the light during the first minutes after the explosion (using novel instruments on fully autonomous telescopes around the globe) to directly probe the magnetic field properties in these extragalactic jets. This technology allowed the detection of highly polarized optical light in GRB 120308A and confirmed the presence of mildly magnetized jets with large-scale primordial magnetic fields in a reduced sample of GRBs (e.g. GRB 090102, GRB 110205A, GRB 101112A, GRB 160625B). Here we discuss the observations of the most energetic and first GRB detected at very high TeV energies, GRB 190114C, which opens a new frontier in GRB magnetic field studies suggesting that some jets can be launched highly magnetized and that the collapse and destruction of these magnetic fields at very early times may have powered the explosion itself. Additionally, our most recent polarimetric observations of the jet of GRB 141220A indicate that, when the jetted ejected material is decelerated by the surrounding environment, the magnetic field amplification mechanisms at the front shock (needed to generate the observed synchrotron emission) produce small magnetic domains. These measurements validate theoretical expectations and contrast with previous observations that suggest large magnetic domains in collisionless shocks (i.e. GRB 091208B).

title: Multi-Messenger Observability of Neutron Star Binary System
authors: Jeshwanth Mohan
topic: As technology has improved, binary neutron star systems have been observed more frequently, in fact, the first gravitational wave to have an electromagnetic counterpart originated from the merger of two neutron stars (GW170817). Detecting these systems prior to merger may help recover essential data for developing an Equation of State for neutron stars. This paper examines the observability of detached eclipsing binary neutron stars prior to merger by simulating the potential observability of neutron star systems in the optical. It is found that it is not likely considering current instruments due to low visibility and inadequate time resolution, however, improvements in the future or a wide field X-ray instrument may offer a viable option for detecting these systems.

title: The collimation of relativistic jets in post-neutron star binary merger simulations
authors: Matteo Pais, Tsvi Piran, Yuri Lyubarsky, Kenta Kiuchi, Masaru Shibata
topic: The gravitational waves from the binary neutron star merger GW170817 were accompanied by a multi-wavelength electromagnetic counterpart, which confirms the association of the merger with a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB). The afterglow observations implied that the event was accompanied by a narrow, 5 deg, and powerful, 1050 erg, jet. We study the propagation of a Poynting flux-dominated jet within the merger ejecta (kinematic, neutrino-driven and MRI turbulence-driven) of a neutrino-radiation-GR-MHD simulation of two coalescing neutron stars. We find that the presence of a post-merger low-density/low-pressure polar cavity, that arose due to angular momentum conservation, is crucial to let the jet break out. At the same time the ejecta collimates the jet to a narrow opening angle. The collimated jet has a narrow opening angle of 4-7 deg and an energy of 1049-1050 erg, in line with the observations of GW170817 and other sGRBs.

title: Hybrid Pulsar-Magnetar Model for FRB 20191221A
authors: Paz Beniamini, Pawan Kumar
topic: We show that the 216.8-0.1 ms periodicity reported for the fast radio burst (FRB) 20191221A is very constraining for burst models. The high accuracy of burst periodicity (better than one part in 103), and the 2\% duty cycle (ratio of burst-duration and inter-burst interval), suggest a pulsar-like rotating beam model for the observed activity; the radio waves are produced along open field lines within 107 cm of the neutron star surface, and the beam periodically sweeps across the observer as the star spins. According to this picture, FRB 20191221A is a factor 1012 scaled up version of galactic pulsars with one major difference: whereas pulsars convert rotational kinetic energy to EM waves, the outbursts of 20191221A require conversion of magnetic energy to radiation.

title: Magnetically driven coupling in relativistic radiation-mediated shocks
authors: J. F. Mahlmann (1), A. Vanthieghem (1, 2), A. A. Philippov (3), A. Levinson (4), E. Nakar (4), F. Fiuza 
topic: The radiation drag in photon-rich environments of cosmic explosions can seed kinetic instabilities by inducing velocity spreads between relativistically streaming plasma components. Such microturbulence is likely imprinted on the breakout signals of radiation-mediated shocks. However, large-scale, transverse magnetic fields in the deceleration region of the shock transition can suppress the dominant kinetic instabilities by preventing the development of velocity separations between electron-positron pairs and a heavy ion species. We use a one-dimensional (1D) five-fluid radiative transfer code to generate self-consistent profiles of the radiation drag force and plasma composition in the deceleration region. For increasing magnetization, our models predict rapidly growing pair multiplicities and a substantial radiative drag developing self-similarly throughout the deceleration region. We extract the critical magnetization parameter sigma-c, determining the limiting magnetic field strength at which a three-species plasma can develop kinetic instabilities before reaching the isotropized downstream. For a relativistic, single ion plasma drifting with gamma-u=10 in the upstream of a relativistic radiation-mediated shock, we find the threshold sigma c=10-7 for the onset of microturbulence. Suppression of plasma instabilities in the case of multi-ion composition would likely require much higher values of sigma-c. Identifying high-energy signatures of microturbulence in shock-breakout signals and combining them with the magnetization limits provided in this work will allow a deeper understanding of the magnetic environment of cosmic explosions like supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and neutron star binary mergers.

title: Self-consistent picture of the mass ejection from a one second-long binary neutron star merger leaving a short-lived remnant in general-relativistic neutrino-radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulation
authors: Kenta Kiuchi, Sho Fujibayashi, Kota Hayashi, Koutarou Kyutoku, Yuichiro Sekiguchi, Masaru Shibata
topic: We perform a general-relativistic neutrino-radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a one second-long binary neutron star merger on Japanese supercomputer Fugaku using about 72 million CPU hours with 20,736 CPUs. We consider an asymmetric binary neutron star merger with masses of 1.2 and 1.5Msun and a soft equation of state SFHo. It results in a short-lived remnant with the lifetime of 0.017\,s, and subsequent massive torus formation with the mass of 0.05Msun after the remnant collapses to a black hole. For the first time, we confirm that after the dynamical mass ejection, which drives the fast tail and mildly relativistic components, the post-merger mass ejection from the massive torus takes place due to the magnetorotational instability-driven turbulent viscosity and the two ejecta components are seen in the distributions of the electron fraction and velocity with distinct features.

title: Nonthermal processes and particle acceleration in supernova remnants
authors: Jacco Vink (1), Aya Bamba (2) ((1)
topic: Shocks of supernova remnants (SNRs) accelerate charged particles up to 100 TeV range via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism. It is believed that shocks of SNRs are the main contributors to the pool of Galactic cosmic rays, although it is still under debate whether they can accelerate particles up to the "knee" energy (10to15.5 eV) or not. In this chapter, we start with introducing SNRs as likely sources of cosmic rays and the radiation mechanisms associated with cosmic rays (section 3). In the section 4, we summarize the mechanism for particle acceleration, including basic diffusive shock acceleration and nonlinear effects, as well as discussing the injection problem. Section 5 is devoted to the X-ray and gamma-ray observations of nonthermal emission from SNRs, and what these reveal about the cosmic-ray acceleration properties of SNRs.

title: Relating quasi-stationary one zone emission models to expanding relativistic shocks
authors: Evgeny Derishev
topic: For an expanding spherical relativistic shock, we derive relations between the parameters of downstream emitting zone and the quantities measured by a distant observer. These relations are formulated in terms of dimensionless effective coefficients combined with self-evident dimensional estimates. Our calculations take into account evolution of the shock's Lorentz factor, geometrical delay due to the shock's front curvature, and angular dependence of Lorentz boost for frequency and brightness. The relations are designed primarily for application in Gamma-Ray Burst afterglow studies, although they may have a broader use.

title: General-relativistic neutrino-radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulation of seconds-long black hole-neutron star mergers: Dependence on initial magnetic field strength, configuration, and neutron-star equation of state
authors: Kota Hayashi, Kenta Kiuchi, Koutarou Kyutoku, Yuichiro Sekiguchi, Masaru Shibata
topic: Numerical-relativity simulations for seconds-long black hole-neutron star mergers are performed to obtain a self-consistent picture starting from the inspiral and the merger throughout the post-merger stages for a variety of setups. Irrespective of the initial and computational setups, we find qualitatively universal evolution processes: The dynamical mass ejection takes place together with a massive accretion disk formation after the neutron star is tidally disrupted; Subsequently, the magnetic field in the accretion disk is amplified by the magnetic winding, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and magnetorotational instability, which establish a turbulent state inducing the dynamo and angular momentum transport; The post-merger mass ejection by the effective viscous effects stemming from the magnetohydrodynamics turbulence sets in at 300-500 ms after the merger and continues for several hundred ms; A magnetosphere near the black-hole spin axis is developed and the collimated strong Poynting flux is generated with its lifetime of 0.5-2 s. The model of no equatorial-plane symmetry shows the reverse of the magnetic-field polarity in the magnetosphere, which is caused by the dynamo associated with the magnetorotational instability in the accretion disk. The model with initially toroidal fields shows the tilt of the disk and magnetosphere in the late post-merger stage because of the anisotropic post-merger mass ejection. These effects could terminate the strong Poynting-luminosity stage within the timescale of 0.5-2 s.

title: Assessment of ALP scenarios for GRB 221009A
authors: Giorgio Galanti, Marco Roncadelli, Fabrizio Tavecchio
topic: About one month after the revolutionary discovery of the Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) GRB 221009A and intense theoretical efforts to explain its detection, time seems to us ripe to make an assessment of the axion-like particle (ALP) based scenarios, since it is a common belief that conventional physics would have prevented such a detection. We overcome the almost complete lack of information -- so far only astronomical telegrams have been released -- by relying as much as possible upon the analogy with the emission from the GRB 190114C detected by the MAGIC collaboration in 2019, since it was the highest energy GRB detected before and for a time lapse similar to that over which GRB 221009A has been observed.

title: Magnetar wind-driven shock breakout emission after double neutron star mergers: The effect of the anisotropy of the merger ejecta
authors: Guang-Lei Wu, Yun-Wei Yu, Shao-Ze Li
topic: A rapidly rotating and highly magnetized remnant neutron star (NS; magnetar) could survive from a merger of double NSs and drive a powerful relativistic wind. The early interaction of this wind with the previous merger ejecta can lead to shock breakout (SBO) emission mainly in ultraviolet and soft X-ray bands, which provides an observational signature for the existence of the remnant magnetar. Here we investigate the effect of an anisotropic structure of the merger ejecta on the SBO emission. It is found that bolometric light curve of the SBO emission can be broadened, since the SBO can occur at different times for different directions. In more detail, the profile of the SBO light curve can be highly dependent on the ejecta structure and, thus, we can in principle use the SBO light curves to probe the structure of the merger ejecta in future.

title: Shock-accelerated electrons during the fast expansion of a coronal mass ejection
authors: D. E. Morosan, J. Pomoell, A. Kumari, R. Vainio, E. K. J. Kilpua
topic: Context. Some of of the most prominent sources for energetic particles in our Solar System are huge eruptions of magnetised plasma from the Sun called coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which usually drive shocks that accelerate charged particles up to relativistic energies. In particular, energetic electron beams can generate radio bursts through the plasma emission mechanism. The main types of bursts associated with CME shocks are type II and herringbone bursts. However, it is currently unknown where early accelerated electrons that produce metric type II bursts and herringbones propagate and when they escape the solar atmosphere. Aims. Here, we investigate the acceleration location, escape, and propagation directions of electron beams during the early evolution of a strongly expanding CME-driven shock wave associated with herrinbgone bursts. Methods. We used ground-based radio observations from the Nançay Radioheliograph combined with space-based extreme-ultraviolet and white-light observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory. We produced a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the electron acceleration locations which, combined with results from magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models of the solar corona, was used to investigate the origin of the herringbone bursts observed. Results. Multiple herringbone bursts are found close to the CME flank in plane-of-sky images. Some of these herringbone bursts have unusual inverted J shapes and opposite drifting herringbones also show opposite senses of circular polarisation. By using a 3D approach combined with the radio properties of the observed bursts, we find evidence that the first radio emission in the CME eruption most likely originates from electrons that initially propagate in regions of low Alfvén speeds and along closed magnetic field lines forming a coronal streamer.

topic: The contemporaneous detection of gravitational waves and gamma rays from the GW170817/GRB 170817A, followed by kilonova emission a day after, confirmed compact binary neutron-star mergers as progenitors of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and cosmic sources of heavy r-process nuclei. However, the nature (and lifespan) of the merger remnant and the energy reservoir powering these bright gamma-ray flashes remains debated, while the first minutes after the merger are unexplored at optical wavelengths. Here, we report the earliest discovery of bright thermal optical emission associated with the short GRB 180618A with extended gamma-ray emission, with ultraviolet and optical multicolour observations starting as soon as 1.4 minutes post-burst. The spectrum is consistent with a fast-fading afterglow and emerging thermal optical emission at 15 minutes post-burst, which fades abruptly and chromatically (flux density Fnu-t-alpha, alpha=4.6+-0.3) just 35 minutes after the GRB. Our observations from gamma rays to optical wavelengths are consistent with a hot nebula expanding at relativistic speeds, powered by the plasma winds from a newborn, rapidly-spinning and highly magnetized neutron star (i.e. a millisecond magnetar), whose rotational energy is released at a rate Lth-t-(2.22+-0.14) to reheat the unbound merger-remnant material. These results suggest such neutron stars can survive the collapse to a black hole on timescales much larger than a few hundred milliseconds after the merger, and power the GRB itself through accretion. Bright thermal optical counterparts to binary merger gravitational wave sources may be common in future wide-field fast-cadence sky surveys.

title: Intense whistler-mode waves at foreshock transients: characteristics and regimes of wave-particle resonant interaction
authors: Xiaofei Shi, Terry Liu, Anton Artemyev, Vassilis Angelopoulos, Xiao-Jia Zhang, Drew L. Turner
topic: Thermalization and heating of plasma flows at shocks result in unstable charged-particle distributions which generate a wide range of electromagnetic waves. These waves, in turn, can further accelerate and scatter energetic particles. Thus, the properties of the waves and their implication for wave-particle interactions are critically important for modeling energetic particle dynamics in shock environments. Whistler-mode waves, excited by the electron heat flux or a temperature anisotropy, arise naturally near shocks and foreshock transients. As a result, they can often interact with supra-thermal electrons. The low background magnetic field typical at the core of such transients and the large wave amplitudes may cause such interactions to enter the nonlinear regime. In this study, we present a statistical characterization of whistler-mode waves at foreshock transients around Earth bow shock, as they are observed under a wide range of upstream conditions. We find that a significant portion of them are sufficiently intense and coherent to warrant nonlinear treatment. Copious observations of background magnetic field gradients and intense whistler wave amplitudes suggest that phase trapping, a very effective mechanism for electron acceleration in inhomogeneous plasmas, may be the cause. We discuss the implications of our findings for electron acceleration in planetary and astrophysical shock environments.

title: External Inverse-Compton and Proton Synchrotron Emission from the Reverse Shock as the Origin of VHE Gamma-Rays from the Hyper-Bright GRB 221009A
authors: B. Theodore Zhang, Kohta Murase, Kunihito Ioka, Deheng Song, Chengchao Yuan, Péter Mészáros
topic: The detection of the hyper-bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A enables us to explore the nature of GRB emission and the origin of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays. We analyze the Fermi-LAT data and investigate GeV-TeV emission in the framework of the external reverse shock model. We show that early 1-10 GeV emission can be explained by the external inverse-Compton mechanism via upscattering MeV gamma-rays by electrons accelerated at the reverse shock, in addition to the synchrotron self-Compton component. The predicted early optical flux could have been brighter than the naked-eye GRB 080319B. We also show that proton synchrotron emission from accelerated ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is detectable, and could potentially explain TeV photons detected by LHAASO or UHECR acceleration can be constrained. Our model suggests that the detection of (10 TeV) photons with energy up to 18 TeV is possible for reasonable models of the extragalactic background light without invoking new physics, and predicts anti-correlations between MeV photons and TeV photons, which can be tested with the LHAASO data.

authors: Alexander w. Criswell, Jesse Miller, Noah Woldemariam, Theodoros Soultanis, Andreas Bauswein, Katerina Chatziioannou, Michael W. Coughlin, Galin Jones, Vuk Mandic
topic: Binary neutron star (BNS) post-merger gravitational-wave emission can occur in the aftermath of a BNS merger -- provided the system avoids prompt collapse to a black hole -- as a quasistable hypermassive remnant experiences quadrupolar oscillations and non-axisymmetric deformations. The post-merger gravitational-wave spectrum possesses a characteristic peak frequency that has been shown to be dependent on the binary chirp mass and the neutron star equation of state (EoS), rendering post-merger gravitational waves a powerful tool for constraining neutron star composition. Unfortunately, the BNS post-merger signal is emitted at high (1.5 kHz) frequencies, where ground-based gravitational wave detectors suffer from reduced sensitivity. It is therefore unlikely that post-merger signals will be detected with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) until the advent of next-generation detectors. However, by employing empirical relations derived from numerical relativity simulations, we can combine information across an ensemble of BNS mergers, allowing us to obtain EoS constraints with many low-SNR signals. We present a hierarchical Bayesian method for deriving constraints on R1.6, the radius of a 1.6Msun neutron star, through an ensemble analysis of binary neutron star mergers. We apply this method to simulations of the next two LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs, O4 and O5, as well as an extended 4-year run at A+ sensitivity, demonstrating the potential of our approach to yield EoS information from the post-merger signal with current-generation detectors. The A+ 4-year scenario is predicted to improve the constraint on R1.6 from the currently available multimessenger-based 95\% C.I. uncertainty of R1.6=12.07+0.98-0.77 km to R1.6=11.91+0.80-0.56 km, a 22% reduction of the 95% C.I. width.

title: Back and Forth: Reverse Phase Transitions in Numerical Relativity Simulations
authors: Maximiliano Ujevic, Henrique Gieg, Federico Schianchi, Swami Vivekanandji Chaurasia, Ingo Tews, Tim Dietrich
topic: Multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers provide a unique opportunity to constrain the dense-matter equation of state. Although it is known from quantum chromodynamics that hadronic matter will undergo a phase transition to exotic forms of matter, e.g., quark matter, the onset density of such a phase transition cannot be computed from first principles. Hence, it remains an open question if such phase transitions occur inside isolated neutron stars or during binary neutron star mergers, or if they appear at even higher densities that are not realized in the Cosmos. In this article, we perform numerical-relativity simulations of neutron-star mergers and investigate scenarios in which the onset density of such a phase transition is exceeded in at least one inspiralling binary component. Our simulations reveal that shortly before the merger it is possible that such stars undergo a "reverse phase transition", i.e., densities decrease and the quark core inside the star disappears leaving a purely hadronic star at merger. After the merger, when densities increase once more, the phase transition occurs again and leads, in the cases considered in this work, to a rapid formation of a black hole. We compute the gravitational-wave signal and the mass ejection for our simulations of such scenarios and find clear signatures that are related to the postmerger phase transition, e.g., smaller ejecta masses due to the softening of the equation of state through the quark core formation. Unfortunately, we do not find measurable imprints of the reverse phase transition.

Namely, black hole-neutron star mergers, depending on the black-hole spins, can play an important role in the early chemical enrichment of the Milky Way. We also show that none of the binary population synthesis models used in this paper, i.e., COMPAS, StarTrack, Brussels, ComBinE, and BPASS, can currently reproduce the elemental abundance observations. The predictions are problematic not only for neutron star mergers, but also for Type Ia supernovae, which may point to shortcomings in binary evolution models.

title: Towards Nebular Spectral Modeling of Magnetar-Powered Supernovae
authors: Conor M. B. Omand, Anders Jerkstrand
topic: Many energetic supernovae are thought to be powered by the rotational-energy of a highly-magnetized, rapidly-rotating neutron star. The emission from the associated luminous pulsar wind nebula (PWN) can photoionize the supernova ejecta, leading to a nebular spectrum of the ejecta with signatures possibly revealing the PWN. SN 2012au is hypothesized to be one such supernova. We investigate the impact of different ejecta and PWN parameters on the supernova nebular spectrum, and test if any photoionization models are consistent with SN 2012au. We study how constraints from the nebular phase can be linked into modelling of the diffusion phase and the radio emission of the magnetar. We present a suite of late-time (1-6y) spectral simulations of SN ejecta powered by an inner PWN. Over a large grid of 1-zone models, we study the behaviour of the SN physical state and line emission as PWN luminosity (LPWN), injection SED temperature (TPWN), ejecta mass (Mej), and composition (pure O or realistic) vary. We discuss the resulting emission in the context of the observed behaviour of SN 2012au, a strong candidate for a PWN-powered SN. The supernova nebular spectrum varies as TPWN varies, as the ejecta become less ionized as TPWN increases. Low ejecta mass models at high PWN power obtain runaway ionization for O I and, in extreme cases, also O II, causing a sharp decrease in their ion fraction over a small change in the parameter space. Certain models can reproduce the oxygen lines luminosities of SN 2012au reasonably well at individual epochs, but we find no model that fits over the whole time evolution; this is likely due to the simple model setup. Using our derived constraints from the nebular phase, we predict that the magnetar powering SN 2012au had an initial rotation period 15 ms, and should be a strong radio source (F larger 100 mJy) for decades.

title: Surrogate light curve models for kilonovae with comprehensive wind ejecta outflows and parameter estimation for AT2017gfo
authors: Atul Kedia, Marko Ristic, Richard O'Shaughnessy, Anjali B. Yelikar, Ryan T. Wollaeger, Oleg Korobkin, Eve A. Chase, Christopher L. Fryer, Christopher J. Fontes
topic: The electromagnetic emission resulting from neutron star mergers have been shown to encode properties of the ejected material in their light curves. The ejecta properties inferred from the kilonova emission has been in tension with those calculated based on the gravitational wave signal and numerical relativity models. Motivated by this tension, we construct a broad set of surrogate light curve models derived for kilonova ejecta. The four-parameter family of two-dimensional anisotropic simulations and its associated surrogate explore different assumptions about the wind outflow morphology and outflow composition, keeping the dynamical ejecta component consistent. We present the capabilities of these surrogate models in interpolating kilonova light curves across various ejecta parameters and perform parameter estimation for AT2017gfo both without any assumptions on the outflow and under the assumption that the outflow must be representative of solar \emph{r}-process abundance patterns. Our parameter estimation for AT2017gfo shows these new surrogate models help alleviate the ejecta property discrepancy while also illustrating the impact of systematic modeling uncertainties on these properties, urging further investigation.

title: Deciphering the 18 TeV photons from GRB 221009A
authors: Sarira Sahu, B. Medina-Carrillo, G. Sánchez-Colón, Subhash Rajpoot
topic: On 9 October, 2022, an extremely powerful gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A, was detected by several instruments. Despite being obstructed by the Milky Way galaxy, its afterglow outburst outshone all other GRBs seen before. LHAASO detected several thousands very-high energy photons extending up to 18 TeV. Detection of such energetic photons are unexpected due to the large opacity of the Universe. It is possible that in the afterglow epoch the intrinsic very high-energy photon flux from the source might have increased manifolds, which could compensate the attenuation by pair-production with the extragalactic background light. We propose such a scenario and show that very high-energy photons can be observed on the Earth from the interaction of very-high energy protons with the seed synchrotron photons in the external forward shock region of the GRB jet.

title: Interacting Kilonovae: Long-lasting Electromagnetic Counterparts to Binary Mergers in the Accretion Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei
authors: Jia Ren, Ken Chen, Yun Wang, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: We investigate the dynamics and electromagnetic (EM) signatures of neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) merger ejecta that occurs in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find that the interaction between ejecta and disk gas leads to important effects on the dynamics and radiation. We show five stages of the ejecta dynamics: gravitational slowing down, coasting, Sedov-Taylor deceleration in the disk, re-acceleration after the breakout from the disk surface, and momentum-conserved snowplow phase. Meanwhile, the radiation from the ejecta is so bright that its typical peak luminosity reaches a few times 1043-1044 erg s-1. Since most of the radiation energy has converted from the kinetic energy of merger ejecta, we call such an explosive phenomenon an interacting kilonova (IKN). It should be emphasized that IKNe are very promising, bright EM counterparts to NS-NS/BH-NS merger events in AGN disks. The bright peak luminosity and long rising time (i.e., ten to twenty days in UV bands, thirty to fifty days in optical bands, and one hundred days to hundreds of days in IR bands) allow most survey telescopes to have ample time to detect an IKN. However, the peak brightness, peak time, and evolution pattern of the light curve of an IKN are similar to a superluminous supernova in a galactic nucleus and a tidal disruption event making it difficult to distinguish between them. But it also suggests that IKNe might have been present in recorded AGN transients.

title: Evolution of the afterglow optical spectral shape of GRB 201015A in the first hour: evidence for dust destruction
authors: Toktarkhan Komesh, Bruce Grossan, Zhanat Maksut, Ernazar Abdikamalov, Maxim Krugov, George F. Smoot
topic: Instruments such as the ROTSE, TORTORA, Pi of the Sky, MASTER-net, and others have recorded single-band optical flux measurements starting as early as 10 seconds after a gamma-ray burst trigger. The earliest measurements of optical spectral shape have been made only much later, typically on hour time scales, never starting less than a minute after trigger, until now. Beginning only 58 seconds after the Swift BAT triggerred on GRB201015A, we observed a sharp rise in flux to a peak, followed by an approximate power law decay light curve, []. Flux was measured simultaneously in three optical filter bands, g', r', and i', using our unique instrument mounted on the Nazarbayev University Transient Telescope at Assy-Turgen Astrophysical Observatory (NUTTelA-TAO). Our simultaneous multi-band observations of the early afterglow show strong colour evolution from red to blue, with a change in the optical log slope (after correction for Milky Way extinction) of []; during this time the X-ray log slope remained constant. We did not find evidence for a two-component jet structure or a transition from reverse to forward shock that would explain this change in slope. We find that the majority of the optical spectral slope evolution is consistent with a monotonic decay of extinction, evidence of dust destruction. If we assume that the optical log slope is constant throughout this period, with the value given by the late-time slope, and we further assume an SMC-like extinction curve, we derive a change in the local extinction Alocalv from 0.8 mag to 0.3 mag in 2500 s. This work shows that significant information about the early emission phase (and possibly prompt emission, if observed early enough) is being missed without such early observations with simultaneous multi-band instruments.

title: Directed search for continuous gravitational waves from the possible kilonova remnant G4.8+6.2
authors: Yu Liu, Yuan-Chuan Zou
topic: G4.8+6.2 was proposed as a possible kilonova remnant associated with the Korean guest star of AD 1163 in our Milky Way galaxy. Its age is about 860 years according to the historical record. If a neutron star was left in the center of G4.8+6.2, this young neutron star may radiate strong continuous gravitational waves, which could beat the indirect age-based upper limit with current LIGO sensitivity. In this work, we searched such continuous gravitational waves in the frequency band 20-1500 Hz. This search used two days of LIGO O3b data from the Hanford and Livingston detectors. While no signal was found, we placed upper limits on the gravitational wave strain. For comparison we also showed the latest results of all-sky searches obtained with various search pipelines. With upgrading of the LIGO detectors, it will provide the opportunity to see whether a black hole or a neutron star is harbored inside G4.8+6.2.

title: DISPATCH methods: an approximate, entropy-based Riemann solver for ideal magnetohydrodynamics
authors: Andrius Popovas
topic: With advance of supercomputers we can now afford simulations with very large range of scales. In astrophysical applications, e.g. simulating Solar, stellar and planetary atmospheres, physical quantities, like gas pressure, density, temperature and plasma beta can vary by orders of magnitude. This requires a robust solver, which can deal with a very wide range of conditions and be able to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium. We reformulate a Godunov-type HLLD Riemann solver so it would be suitable to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium in atmospheric applications and would be able to handle low and high Mach numbers, regimes where kinetic and magnetic energies dominate over thermal energy without any ad-hoc corrections. We change the solver to use entropy instead of total energy as the 'energy' variable in the system of MHD equations. The entropy is not conserved, it increases when kinetic and magnetic energy is converted to heat, as it should. We conduct a series of standard tests with varying conditions and show that the new formulation for the Godunot type Riemann solver works and is very promising.

title: Neutrino Origin of LHAASO's 18 TeV GRB221009A Photon
authors: Vedran Brdar, Ying-Ying Li
topic: LHAASO collaboration detected photons with energy above 10 TeV from the most recent gamma-ray burst (GRB), GRB221009A. Given the redshift of this event, z-0.15, photons of such energy are expected to interact with the diffuse extragalactic background light (EBL) well before reaching Earth. In this paper we provide the first neutrino-related explanation of the most energetic 18 TeV event reported by LHAASO. We find that the minimal viable scenario involves both mixing and transition magnetic moment portal between light and sterile neutrinos. The production of sterile neutrinos occurs efficiently via mixing while the transition magnetic moment portal governs the decay rate in the parameter space where tree-level decays via mixing to non-photon final states are suppressed. Our explanation of this event, while being consistent with the terrestrial constraints, points to the non-standard cosmology.

title: On ALP scenarios and GRB 221009A
authors: Pierluca Carenza, M.C. David Marsh
topic: The extraordinarily bright gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A was observed by a large number of observatories, from radio frequencies to gamma-rays. Of particular interest are the reported observations of photon-like air showers of very high energy: an 18 TeV event in LHAASO and a 251 TeV event at Carpet-2. Gamma rays at these energies are expected to be absorbed by pair-production events on background photons when travelling intergalactic distances. Several works have sought to explain the observations of these events, assuming they originate from GRB 221009A, by invoking axion-like particles (ALPs). We reconsider this scenario and account for astrophysical uncertainties due to poorly known magnetic fields and background photon densities. We find that, robustly, the ALP scenario cannot simultaneously account for an 18 TeV and a 251 TeV photon from GRB 221009A.

title: A Bayesian inference of relativistic mean-field model for neutron star matter from observation of NICER and GW170817/AT2017gfo
authors: Zhenyu Zhu, Ang Li, Tong liu
topic: The observations of optical and near-infrared counterparts of binary neutron star mergers not only enrich our knowledge about the abundance of heavy elements in the Universe, or help reveal the remnant object just after the merger as generally known, but also can effectively constrain dense nuclear matter properties and the equation of state (EOS) in the interior of the merging stars. Following the relativistic mean-field description of nuclear matter, we perform the Bayesian inference of the EOS and the nuclear matter properties using the first multi-messenger event GW170817/AT2017gfo, together with the NICER mass-radius measurements of pulsars. The kilonova is described by a radiation-transfer model with the dynamical ejecta, and light curves connect with the EOS through the quasi-universal relations between the ejecta properties (the ejected mass, velocity, opacity or electron fraction) and binary parameters (the mass ratio and reduced tidal deformability). It is found that the posterior distributions of the reduced tidal deformability from the AT2017gfo analysis display a bimodal structure, with the first peak enhanced by the GW170817 data, leading to slightly softened posterior EOSs, while the second peak cannot be achieved by a nuclear EOS with saturation properties in their empirical ranges. The inclusion of NICER data in our analyses results in stiffened EOS posterior because of the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620. We give results at nuclear saturation density for the nuclear incompressibility, the symmetry energy and its slope, as well as the nucleon effective mass, from our analysis of those observational data.

topic: As we further our studies on Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), both on theoretical models and observational tools, more and more options begin to open for exploration of its physical properties. As transient events primarily dominated by synchrotron radiation, it is expected that the synchrotron photons emitted by GRBs should present some degree of polarization throughout the evolution of the burst. Whereas observing this polarization can still be challenging due to the constraints on observational tools, especially for short GRBs, it is paramount that the groundwork is laid for the day we have abundant data. In this work, we present a polarization model linked with an off-axis spreading top-hat jet synchrotron scenario in a stratified environment with a density profile n(r)-r-k. We present this model's expected temporal polarization evolution for a realistic set of afterglow parameters constrained within the values observed in the GRB literature for four degrees of stratification k=0,1,1.5and2 and two magnetic field configurations with high extreme anisotropy. We apply this model and predict polarization from a set of GRBs exhibiting off-axis afterglow emission. In particular, for GRB 170817A, we use the available polarimetric upper limits to rule out the possibility of a extremely anisotropic configuration for the magnetic field.

title: Constraints on Electron Acceleration in Gamma-Ray Bursts Afterglows from Radio Peaks
authors: Ruby A. Duncan, Alexander J. van der Horst, Paz Beniamini
topic: Studies of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their multi-wavelength afterglows have led to insights in electron acceleration and emission properties from relativistic, high-energy astrophysical sources. Broadband modeling across the electromagnetic spectrum has been the primary means of investigating the physics behind these sources, although independent diagnostic tools have been developed to inform and corroborate assumptions made in particle acceleration simulations and broadband studies. We present a methodology to constrain three physical parameters related to electron acceleration in GRB blast waves: the fraction of shock energy in electrons, eps-e; the fraction of electrons that gets accelerated into a power-law distribution of energies, xi-e; and the minimum Lorentz factor of the accelerated electrons, gamma-m. These parameters are constrained by observations of the peaks in radio afterglow light curves and spectral energy distributions. From a sample of 49 radio afterglows, we are able to find narrow distributions for these parameters, hinting at possible universality of the blast wave microphysics, although observational bias could play a role in this. Using radio peaks and considerations related to the prompt gamma-ray emission efficiency, we constrain the allowed parameter ranges for both ϵe and ξe to within about one order of magnitude, 0.01 less eps-less 0.2 and 0.1 less xi-e less 1. Such stringent constraints are inaccessible for xi-e from broadband studies due to model degeneracies.

authors: Samuele Ronchini, Giulia Stratta, Andrea Rossi, David Alexander Kann, Gor Oganesyan, Simone Dall'Osso, Marica Branchesi, Giovanni De Cesare
topic: A large fraction of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) shows a plateau phase during the X-ray afterglow emission, whose physical origin is still debated. In this work we define a sample of 30 GRBs with simultaneous X-ray and optical data during and after the plateau phase. Through a time-resolved spectral analysis of the X-ray plateaus, we test the consistency of the unabsorbed optical fluxes with those obtained via X-ray-to-optical spectral extrapolation by assuming a synchrotron spectrum. Combining X-ray with optical data, we find that 63% (19/30) GRBs are compatible with a single synchrotron spectrum thus suggesting that both the optical and X-ray radiations are produced from a single emitting region. For these GRBs we derive the temporal evolution of the break frequency and we compare it with the expectations predicted by several models. For 11/30 GRBs the optical emission is above the predicted range of values extrapolated from the X-rays in at least one temporal bin of the light curve. These GRBs may not be explained with a single zone emission, indicating the necessity of invoking two cooperating processes in order to explain the broad band spectral behaviour during X-ray plateaus. We discuss our findings in the framework of different scenarios invoked to explain the plateau feature, including the energy injection from a spinning-down magnetar and the high latitude emission from a structured jet.

title: GRB221009A Gamma Rays from Radiative Decay of Heavy Neutrinos?
authors: Alexei Y. Smirnov, Andreas Trautner
topic: We consider a mechanism which allows to decrease the attenuation of the high energy gamma ray flux from gamma ray burst GRB 221009A. The mechanism is based on the existence of a heavy mN-0.1MeV mostly sterile neutrino N which mixes with active (muon) neutrinos. N's are produced in GRB in pion and Kaon decays via mixing with neutirnos-mu. They undergo the radiative decay N→νγ on the way to the Earth. The usual exponential attenuation of gamma rays is lifted to an attenuation inverse in the optical depth. Various restrictions on this scenario are discussed. We find that the high energy γ events at 18TeV and potentially 251TeV can be explained if (i) the GRB active neutrino fluence is close to the observed limit, (ii) the branching ratio of N to neutrino-gamma is at least of the order 10\%.

title: Global high-order numerical schemes for the time evolution of the general relativistic radiation magneto-hydrodynamics equations
authors: Manuel R. Izquierdo, Lorenzo Pareschi, Borja Miñano, Joan Massó, Carlos Palenzuela
topic: Modeling correctly the transport of neutrinos is crucial in some astrophysical scenarios such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. In this paper, we focus on the truncated-moment formalism, considering only the first two moments (M1 scheme) within the grey approximation, which reduces Boltzmann seven-dimensional equation to a system of 3+1 equations closely resembling the hydrodynamic ones. Solving the M1 scheme is still mathematically challenging, since it is necessary to model the radiation-matter interaction in regimes where the evolution equations become stiff and behave as an advection-diffusion problem. Here, we present different global, high-order time integration schemes based on Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX) methods designed to overcome the time-step restriction caused by such behavior while allowing us to use the explicit RK commonly employed for the MHD and Einstein equations. Finally, we analyze their performance in several numerical tests.

title: Bayesian analysis of neutron-star properties with parameterized equations of state: the role of the likelihood functions
authors: Jin-Liang Jiang, Christian Ecker, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: We have investigated the systematic differences introduced when performing a Bayesian-inference analysis of the equation of state of neutron stars employing either variable- or constant-likelihood functions. The former have the advantage that it retains the full information on the distributions of the measurements, making an exhaustive usage of the data. The latter, on the other hand, have the advantage of a much simpler implementation and reduced computational costs. In both approaches, the EOSs have identical priors and have been built using the sound-speed parameterization method so as to satisfy the constraints from X-ray and gravitational-waves observations, as well as those from Chiral Effective Theory and perturbative QCD. In all cases, the two approaches lead to very similar results and the 90\%-confidence levels are essentially overlapping. Some differences do appear, but in regions where the probability density is extremely small and are mostly due to the sharp cutoff set on the binary tidal deformability Lambda less 720 employed in the constant-likelihood analysis. Our analysis has also produced two additional results. First, a clear inverse correlation between the normalized central number density of a maximally massive star, nc,TOV/ns, and the radius of a maximally massive star, RTOV. Second, and most importantly, it has confirmed the relation between the chirp mass chirp and the binary tidal deformability LambdaTilde. The importance of this result is that it relates a quantity that is measured very accurately, less chirp, with a quantity that contains important information on the micro-physics, LambdaTilde. Hence, once less chirp is measured in future detections, our relation has the potential of setting tight constraints on LambdaTilde.

title: Extremely Relativistic Tidal Disruption Events
authors: Taeho Ryu, Julian Krolik, Tsvi Piran
topic: Extreme tidal disruption events (eTDEs), which occur when a star passes very close to a supermassive black hole, may provide a way to observe a long-sought general relativistic effect: orbits that wind several times around a black hole and then leave. Through general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, we show that such eTDEs are easily distinguished from most tidal disruptions, in which stars come close, but not so close, to the black hole. Following the stellar orbit, the debris in eTDEs is initially distributed in a crescent that quickly turns into tight spirals, from which some mass later falls back toward the black hole, while the remainder is ejected. Internal shocks within the infalling debris power the observed emission. The resulting light-curve rises rapidly to roughly the Eddington luminosity, maintains this level for between a few weeks and a year (depending on both the stellar mass and the black hole mass), and then drops. Most of its power is in thermal X-rays at a temperature 106 K (100 eV). The debris evolution and observational features of eTDEs are qualitatively different from ordinary TDEs, making eTDEs a new type of TDE. Although eTDEs are relatively rare for lower-mass black holes, most tidal disruptions around higher-mass black holes are extreme. Their detection offers a view of an exotic relativistic phenomenon previously inaccessible.

authors: Swapnil Shankar, Philipp Mösta, Steven R. Brandt, Roland Haas, Erik Schnetter, Yannick de Graaf
topic: We present GRaM-X (General Relativistic accelerated Magnetohydrodynamics on AMReX), a new GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) code which extends the GRMHD capability of Einstein Toolkit to GPU-based exascale systems. GRaM-X supports 3D adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) on GPUs via a new AMR driver for the Einstein Toolkit called CarpetX which in turn leverages AMReX, an AMR library developed for use by the United States DOE's Exascale Computing Project (ECP). We use the Z4c formalism to evolve the equations of GR and the Valencia formulation to evolve the equations of GRMHD. GRaM-X supports both analytic as well as tabulated equations of state. We implement TVD and WENO reconstruction methods as well as the HLLE Riemann solver. We test the accuracy of the code using a range of tests on static spacetime, e.g. 1D MHD shocktubes, the 2D magnetic rotor and a cylindrical explosion, as well as on dynamical spacetimes, i.e. the oscillations of a 3D TOV star. We find excellent agreement with analytic results and results of other codes reported in literature. We also perform scaling tests and find that GRaM-X shows a weak scaling efficiency of 40-50\% on 2304 nodes (13824 NVIDIA V100 GPUs) with respect to single-node performance on OLCF's supercomputer Summit.

We explore multi-messenger and multi-wavelength methods of identification of a NS merger origin of radio bursts, such as in fast radio burst surveys, triggered observations of gamma-ray bursts and gravitational wave events, and optical/radio follow-up of fast radio bursts in search of kilonova and radio afterglow emission. We present our findings for current and future observing facilities, and make recommendations for verifying or constraining the model.

authors: M. M. González, D. Avila Rojas, A. Pratts, S Hernández, N. Fraija, R. Alfaro, Y. Pérez Araujo, J. A. Montes
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been considered as potential very high-energy photon emitters due to the large amount of energy released as well as the strong magnetic fields involved. However, the detection of TeV photons is not expected from bursts beyond a redshift of z less 0.1 due to the attenuation caused by the interaction with photons from the extragalactic background light (EBL). The observation of an 18-TeV photon from GRB 221009A (z=0.15) last October 9th, 2022 has challenged what we know about the TeV-emission mechanisms and the extragalactic background. Recent explanations exploiting candidates of dark matter have started to appear. In this paper, we discuss the required conditions and limitations within the most plausible scenario, synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) radiation in the GRB afterglow, to interpret the one 18-TeV photon observation besides the EBL. To avoid the Klein-Nishina effect, we find an improbable value of the microphysical magnetic parameter below 10-6 for a circumburst medium less cm-3 (expected in the collapsar scenario). Therefore, we explore possible scenarios in terms of ALPs and dark photon mechanisms to interpret this highly-energetic photon and discuss the implications in the GRB energetics. We find the ALPs and dark photon scenarios explain the 18 TeV photon but not the 251 TeV photon.

title: Dynamics of a relativistic jet through magnetized media
authors: Leonardo Garcia-Garcia, Diego Lopez-Camara, Davide Lazzati
topic: The merger of two neutron stars (NSs) produces the emission of gravitational waves, the formation of a compact object surrounded by a dense and magnetized environment, and the launching of a collimated and relativistic jet, which will eventually produce a short gamma-ray burst (SGRB). The interaction of the jet with the environment has been shown to play a major role in shaping the structure of the outflow that eventually powers the gamma-ray emission. In this paper, we present a set of 2.5 dimensional RMHD simulations that follow the evolution of a relativistic non-magnetized jet through a medium with different magnetization levels, as produced after the merger of two NSs. We find that the predominant consequence of a magnetized ambient medium is that of suppressing instabilities within the jet, and preventing the formation of a series of collimation shocks. One implication of this is that internal shocks lose efficiency, causing bursts with low-luminosity prompt emission. On the other hand, the jet-head velocity and the induced magnetization within the jet are fairly independent from the magnetization of the ambient medium. Future numerical studies with a larger domain are necessary to obtain light curves and spectra in order to better understand the role of magnetized media.

topic: Gamma-ray burst GRB 211211A may have been the result of a neutron star merger at 350 Mpc. However, none of the LIGO-Virgo detectors were operating at the time. We show that the gravitational-wave signal from a \grb-like binary neutron star inspiral in the next LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O4) would be below the conventional detection threshold, however a coincident gamma-ray burst observation would provide necessary information to claim a statistically-significant multimessenger observation. We calculate that with O4 sensitivity, approximately 11\% of gamma-ray bursts within 600 Mpc will produce a confident association between the gravitational-wave binary neutron star inspiral signature and the prompt gamma-ray signature. This corresponds to a coincident detection rate of [], where the uncertainties are the 90\% confidence intervals arising from uncertainties in the absolute merger rate, beaming and jet-launching fractions. These increase to approximately 34\% and [] with proposed O5 sensitivity. We show that the above numbers do not depend significantly on the number of gravitational-wave observatories operating with the specific sensitivity. That is, the number of confident joint gamma-ray burst and gravitational-wave detections is only marginally improved with two or three detectors operating compared to a single detector. It is therefore worth considering whether one detector with sufficient sensitivity (post O4) should remain in sky-watch mode at all times to elucidate the true nature of GRB 211211A-like events, a proposal we discuss in detail.

title: Secondary GeV-TeV emission from ultra-high-energy cosmic rays accelerated by GRB 221009A
authors: Nestor Mirabal
topic: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains elusive. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the best candidates able to meet the stringent energy requirements needed for particle acceleration to such high energies. If UHECRs were accelerated by the central engine of GRB 221009A, it might be possible to detect secondary photons and neutrinos as the UHECRs travel from the source to the Earth. Here we attempt to interpret some of the early publicly available data connected to this burst. If the reported early GeV-TeV detection was produced by secondary emission from UHECRs it probably indicates that UHECRs reached energies 1021 eV and that GRB 221009A exploded inside a magnetic void with intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) strength B3x10-16 G. In order to understand the entire energy deposition mechanism, we propose to search existing and future Fermi-LAT data for secondary emission arriving over larger spatial scales and longer time-scales. This strategy might help clarify the origin of UHECRs, constrain the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) strength along this line of sight and start to quantify the fraction of magnetic voids around GRBs.

title: Similar general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic codes produce different results for binary neutron star mergers
authors: Pedro Luis Espino, Gabriele Bozzola, Vasileios Paschalidis
topic: In this paper, we show that similar open-source codes for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) produce different results for key features of binary neutron star mergers. First, we present a new open-source version of the publicly available IllinoisGRMHD code that provides support for realistic, finite temperature equations of state. After stringent tests of our upgraded code, we perform a code comparison between GRHydro, IllinoisGRMHD, Spritz, and WhiskyTHC, which implement the same physics, but slightly different computational methods. The benefit of the comparison is that all codes are embedded in the EinsteinToolkit suite, hence their only difference is algorithmic. We find similar convergence properties, fluid dynamics, and gravitational waves, but different merger times, remnant lifetimes, and gravitational wave phases. Such differences must be resolved before the post-merger dynamics modeled with such simulations can be reliably used to infer the properties of nuclear matter especially in the era of precision gravitational wave astronomy.

title: Ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray signature in GRB 221009A
authors: Saikat Das, Soebur Razzaque
topic: The brightest long gamma-ray burst detected so far by the Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM telescopes, GRB221009A provides an unprecedented opportunity for understanding the high-energy processes in extreme transient phenomena. We find that the conventional leptonic models, synchrotron and synchrotron-self-Compton, for the afterglow emission from this source is unable to explain observation of gamma rays, by the LHAASO detector, extending up to 18 TeV energies. We model gamma-ray spectrum estimated in the energy range 0.1-1 GeV, by the Fermi-LAT detector. The flux predicted by our leptonic models is severely attenuated at larger 1 TeV due to gamma-gamma pair production with extragalactic background light, and hence an additional component is required. Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays can be accelerated in the GRB jet and their propagation induces an electromagnetic cascade in the extragalactic medium. The line of sight component of this flux can explain TeV emission detected by LHAASO, requiring a fraction of the GRB blastwave energy in ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays. This could be the first direct evidence of ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray acceleration in GRBs.

title: Radio-bright vs. Radio-dark Gamma-ray Bursts -- More Evidence for Distinct Progenitors
authors: Angana Chakraborty, Maria Dainotti, Olivia Cantrell, Nicole Lloyd-Ronning
topic: We analyze two distinct samples of GRBs, with and without radio afterglow emission. We use a sample of 211 GRBs which is an update of the previous sample from arXiv:1902.01974, and find, in agreement with previous results (although with a sample that is almost twice as large) as the intrinsic gamma-ray duration (Tint) and isotropic equivalent energy (Eiso) distributions between these two populations appear to differ significantly. The redshift (z) distributions of the two samples are not statistically different. We analyze several correlations between variables (Eiso, Tint, jet opening angle, and z), accounting for selection effects and redshift evolution using the Efron-Petrosian method. We find a statistically significant anti-correlation between the jet opening angle and redshift, as well as between Tint and redshift, for both radio-bright and radio-dark GRBs. Finally, in agreement with previous work, we find that very high energy (0.1 - 100 GeV) extended emission is present in the radio-bright GRB sample only. Our work supports the possibility that the radio-bright and the radio-dark GRBs originate from different progenitors.

topic: The GRB 190829A has been widely studied due to its nature and the high energy emission presented. Due to the detection of a very-high-energy component by the High Energy Stereoscopic System and the event's atypically middling luminosity, it has been categorized in a select, limited group of bursts bordering classic GRBs and nearby sub-energetic events. Given the range of models utilized to adequately characterize the afterglow of this burst, it has proven challenging to identify the most probable explanation. Nevertheless, the detection of polarization data provided by the MASTER collaboration has added a new aspect to GRB 190829A that permits us to attempt to explore this degeneracy. In this paper, we present a polarization model coupled with a synchrotron forward-shock model -- a component in all models used to describe GRB 190829A's afterglow -- in order to fit the polarization's temporal evolution with the existing upper limits (Π less 6\%). We find that the polarization generated from an on-axis emission is favored for strongly anisotropic magnetic field ratios, while an off-axis scenario cannot be fully ruled out when a more isotropic framework is taken into account.

title: GRB 221009A: a potential source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays
authors: Rafael Alves Batista
topic: Recently an extraordinarily bright gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A, was observed by several facilities covering the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays with energies up to 18 TeV were detected, as well as a photon with 251 TeV. Such energetic events are not expected because they would be attenuated by pair-production interactions with the extragalactic background light. This tension is, however, only apparent, and does not call for any unconventional explanation. Here I show that these observations could be interpreted as the result of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) interacting with cosmological radiation fields during their journey to Earth, provided that intergalactic magnetic fields are reasonably weak. If this hypothesis is correct, it would establish bursts like GRB 221009A as UHECR sources.

title: Binary neutron star merger simulations with neutrino transport and turbulent viscosity: impact of different schemes and grid resolution
authors: Francesco Zappa, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, David Radice, Albino Perego
topic: We present a systematic numerical relativity study of the impact of different treatment of microphysics and grid resolution in binary neutron star mergers. We consider series of simulations at multiple resolutions comparing hydrodynamics, neutrino leakage scheme, leakage augmented with the M0 scheme and the more consistent M1 transport scheme. Additionally, we consider the impact of a sub-grid scheme for turbulent viscosity. We find that viscosity helps to stabilise the remnant against gravitational collapse but grid resolution has a larger impact than microphysics on the remnant's stability. The gravitational wave (GW) energy correlates with the maximum remnant density, that can be thus inferred from GW observations. M1 simulations shows the emergence of a neutrino trapped gas that locally decreases the temperature a few percent when compared to the other simulation series. This out-of-thermodynamics equilibrium effect does not alter the GW emission at the typical resolutions considered for mergers. Different microphysics treatments impact significantly mass, geometry and composition of the remnant's disc and ejecta. M1 simulations show systematically larger proton fractions. The different ejecta compositions reflect into the nucleosynthesis yields, that are robust only if both neutrino emission and absorption are simulated. Synthetic kilonova light curves calculated by means of spherically-symmetric radiation-hydrodynamics evolutions up to 15 days post-merger are mostly sensitive to ejecta's mass and composition; they can be reliably predicted only including the various ejecta components. We conclude that advanced microphysics in combination with resolutions higher than current standards appear essential for robust long-term evolutions and astrophysical predictions.

title: Delayed teraelectronvolt emission from GRB 980425/SN 1998bw and the origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays
authors: Nestor Mirabal
topic: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, E larger 1018 eV) is one of the great mysteries of modern astrophysics. It has been suggested that UHECRs could be accelerated in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and engine-driven supernovae (SNe). Here we report the discovery of a 1.4 teraelectronvolt (TeV) photon offset 0.97deg from the site of the nearby (36.9 megaparsecs) GRB 980425/SN 1998bw explosion. The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected the TeV emission on 17 November 2018, more than 20 years after the original GRB 980425/SN 1998bw trigger. TeV detections at high Galactic latitudes by the LAT are extremely rare, with an average of 6 events per year. We propose that the delayed TeV emission is consistent with ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and/or electron-positron pairs from GRB 980425/SN 1998bw being deflected by the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) and subsequently cascading into secondary gamma rays. Based on the arrival time delay of the TeV emission, we estimate an IGMF strength of order B=10-12-10-13 Gauss. This result supports the possibility of UHECR acceleration in GRB 980425/SN 1998bw and suggests that most detected UHECRs are produced in local GRB/SNe within 200 Mpc. In addition, secondary photons from UHECRs out to 0.9-31 Gpc may also offer an explanation for extragalactic background photons with energies ≥1 TeV detected by the Fermi LAT.

title: Interface instabilities in hydrodynamic relativistic jets
authors: Pavel Abolmasov, Omer Bromberg
topic: Both the dynamics and the observational properties of relativistic jets are determined by their interaction with the ambient medium. A crucial role is played by the contact discontinuity at the jet boundary, which in the presence of jet collimation may become subject to Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) and Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI). Here, we study the evolution of these instabilities in non-magnetized relativistic jets using special relativistic three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We show that the growth of initial perturbations is consistent with relativistic RTI operating in the jet collimation region. The contribution of RMI becomes important downstream from the collimation shock in agreement with theoretical expectations. Both instabilities reach non-linear scales above the shock convergence point and trigger strong turbulence, mixing jet with ambient matter. We devise an analytic solution for the mixing rate and show that it is sensitive to the external density gradients. Our results may be applied to different types of astrophysical objects. In particular, different contribution of interface instabilities is a natural explanation for the observed dichotomy between FR-I and FR-II radiogalaxies. The rapid slow-down in the jet of M87 is consistent with baryon entrainment from the circumnuclear matter with the observed density distribution. In microquasars, baryon loading triggered by interface instabilities is a probable reason for the low observed Lorentz factors. We show that the observed variability in gamma-ray bursts cannot come from mixing driven by interface instabilities and likely originates from the engine, suggesting the presence of magnetic fields in the jet.

title: Steady jet ejections from the innermost region of advection-dominated accretion flow around a black hole
authors: Hajime Inoue
topic: We study ejection mechanisms for two kinds of steady jets: one observed from black hole binaries in the low/hard state and the other from SS433. The specific energy of the ejected gas is required to be positive for the jets to get to infinity, while that of the accreted gas is naively considered to be negative at the outermost boundary of the accretion flow. To reconcile the opposite sign of the specific energies, we propose a situation where two layers exist in the accretion flow and one layer receives energy from the other sufficiently for the specific energy to be positive. For the steady jets in the low/hard state, the accretion ring at the outermost end of the accretion flow is considered to yield two-layer flow in which a geometrically thick ADAF sandwiches a geometrically thin accretion disk and the thin disk is supposed to turn to another ADAF on the inner side. The energy transfer is expected to occur through turbulent mixing between the two layers and the upper layer is discussed to have the positive specific energy large enough for the terminal velocity to be 0.1 c. For the steady jets from SS433, a slim disk is argued to separate into two stratified layers due to the photon diffusion in the direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane under the advection dominated situation. In this case, the specific energy of the upper layer is expected to be positive such that the terminal velocity exceeds 0.2 c. The jet ejection process near the black hole is investigated commonly to both the two-layer cases and predicts the jet opening angle becomes as small as 2deg.

title: Search for gravitational-wave transients associated with magnetar bursts in Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data from the third observing run
authors: LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, the KAGRA Collaboration
topic: Gravitational waves are expected to be produced from neutron star oscillations associated with magnetar giant flares and short bursts. We present the results of a search for short-duration (milliseconds to seconds) and long-duration (100 s) transient gravitational waves from 13 magnetar short bursts observed during Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA's third observation run. These 13 bursts come from two magnetars, SGR 1935+2154 and Swift J1818.0−1607. We also include three other electromagnetic burst events detected by Fermi GBM which were identified as likely coming from one or more magnetars, but they have no association with a known magnetar. No magnetar giant flares were detected during the analysis period. We find no evidence of gravitational waves associated with any of these 16 bursts. We place upper bounds on the root-sum-square of the integrated gravitational-wave strain that reach [] Hz for the short-duration search and [] at 450 Hz for the long-duration search, given a detection efficiency of 50%. For a ringdown signal at 1590 Hz targeted by the short-duration search the limit is set to 1.[]. Using the estimated distance to each magnetar, we derive upper bounds on the emitted gravitational-wave energy of [] for SGR 1935+2154 and [] for Swift J1818.0−1607, for the short-duration (long-duration) search. Assuming isotropic emission of electromagnetic radiation of the burst fluences, we constrain the ratio of gravitational-wave energy to electromagnetic energy for bursts from SGR 1935+2154 with available fluence information. The lowest of these ratios is 3x103.

title: A search for kilonova radio flares in a sample of Swift/BAT short GRBs
authors: A. Eddins, K.H. Lee, A. Corsi, I. Bartos, Z. Marka, S. Marka
topic: The multi-messenger detection of GW170817 showed that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are progenitors of (at least some) short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and that short GRB jets (and their afterglows) can have structures (and observational properties) more complex than predicted by the standard top-hat jet scenario. Indeed, the emission from the structured jet launched in GW170817 peaked in the radio band (cm wavelengths) at about 100 d since merger - a timescale much longer than the typical time span of radio follow-up observations of short GRBs. Moreover, radio searches for a potential late-time radio flare from the fast tail of the neutron-rich debris that powered the kilonova associated with GW170817 (AT2017gfo) have extended to even longer timescales (years after the merger). In light of this, here we present the results of an observational campaign targeting a sample of seven, years-old GRBs in the Swift/BAT sample with no redshift measurements and no promptly-identified X-ray counterpart. Our goal is to assess whether this sample of short GRBs could harbor nearby BNS mergers, searching for the late-time radio emission expected from their ejecta. We found one radio candidate counterpart for one of the GRBs in our sample, GRB111126A, though an origin related to emission from star formation or from an AGN in its host galaxy cannot be excluded without further observations.

title: Very High Energy Afterglow Emission of GRB221009A: Lessons Learned from the Brightest Long Gamma-ray Burst in a Wind Environment
authors: Jia Ren, Yun Wang, Lu-Lu Zhang
topic: In this paper, we modeled the dynamics and radiation physics of the rarity event GRB 221009A afterglow in detail. Based on the analysis results of the { ASGARD} package we developed, the afterglow data of GRB 221009A strongly favors the origin of a relativistic jet propagating in a stellar-wind-dominated environment. Therefore, GRB 221009A is a typical lesson for the very high energy (VHE) afterglow of long gamma-ray burst in a wind environment. We also show the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis results of GRB 221009A, and find that the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation component of GRB 221009A is very bright in the 0.1-10 TeV band. The integrated SED of 0-2000 s after {\em Fermi}/GBM trigger shows that the bright SSC component can be easily observed in TeV band, above the detection sensitivity of LHASSO, MAGIC and CTA. We predict that the SSC radiation peak flux of GRB 221009A in the first 2000 second integral SED is 10-7 erg cm-2 s-1, with a peak energy close to 300 GeV. Furthermore, we find that the inclusion of GeV observations could break the degeneracy between model parameters, highlighting the significance of high-energy observations in determining accurate parameters for GRB afterglows.

topic: The race for the most distant object in the Universe has been played by long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), star-forming galaxies and quasars. GRBs took a temporary lead with the discovery of GRB 090423 at a redshift z=8.2, but now the record-holder is the galaxy GN-z11 at z=11.0. Despite this record, galaxies and quasars are very faint (GN-z11 has a magnitude H=26), hampering the study of the physical properties of the primordial Universe. On the other hand, GRB afterglows are brighter by a factor of 100, with the drawback of lasting only for 1-2 days. Here we describe a novel approach to the discovery of high-redshift (z 6) GRBs, exploiting their near-infrared (nIR) emission properties. Soon after the bright, high-energy prompt phase, a GRB is accompanied by an afterglow. The afterglows of high-redshift GRBs are naturally absorbed, like any other source, at optical wavelengths by Hydrogen along the line of sight in the intergalactic medium (Lyman-alpha absorption). We propose to take advantage of the deep monitoring of the sky by the Vera Rubin Observatory, to simultaneously observe exactly the same fields with a new, dedicated nIR facility. By comparing the two streams of transients, one can pinpoint transients detected in the nIR band and not in the optical band. These fast transients detected only in the nIR and with an AB colour index r-H 3.5 are high-redshift GRBs, with a low contamination rate. Thanks to the depth reached by the Rubin observations, interlopers can be identified, allowing us to discover 11 GRBs at z 6 per year and  3 GRBs per year at z 10. This turns out to be one of the most effective probes of the high-redshift Universe.

title: Critical Mach Numbers for Magnetohydrodynamic Shocks with Accelerated Particles and Waves
authors: J. Martin Laming
topic: The first critical fast Mach number is defined for a magnetohydrodynamic shock as the Mach number where the shock transitions from subcritical, laminar, behavior to supercritical behavior, characterized by incident ion reflection from the shock front. The ensuing upstream waves and turbulence are convected downstream leading to a turbulent shock structure. Formally this is the Mach number where plasma resistivity can no longer provide sufficient dissipation to establish a stable shock, and is characterized by the downstream flow speed becoming subsonic. We revisit these calculations, including in the MHD jump conditions terms modeling the plasma energy loss to accelerated particles and the presence of waves associated with these particles. The accelerated particle contributions make an insignificant change, but the associated waves have a more important effect. Upstream waves can be strongly amplified in intensity on passing through the shock, and represent another means of shock dissipation. The presence of such waves therefore increases the first critical fast Mach number, especially at quasi-parallel shock where wave excitation is strongest. These effects may have significance for the solar regions where shock waves accelerate particles and cause Type II and Type III radio bursts, and also contribute to the event-to-event variability of SEP acceleration.

authors: Shuo Xiao, Wen-Xi Peng, Shuang-Nan Zhang, Shao-Lin Xiong, Xiao-Bo Li, You-Li Tuo, He Gao, Yue Wang, Wang-Chen Xue, Chao Zheng, Yan-Qiu Zhang, Jia-Cong Liu et al
topic: The precursors of short and long Gamma Ray Bursts (SGRBs and LGRBs) can serve as probes of their progenitors, as well as shedding light on the physical processes of mergers or core-collapse supernovae. Some models predict the possible existence of Quasi-Periodically Oscillations (QPO) in the precursors of SGRBs. Although many previous studies have performed QPO search in the main emission of SGRBs and LGRBs, so far there was no systematic QPO search in their precursors. In this work, we perform a detailed QPO search in the precursors of SGRBs and LGRBs detected by Fermi/GBM from 2008 to 2019 using the power density spectrum (PDS) in frequency domain and Gaussian processes (GP) in time domain. We do not find any convinced QPO signal with significance above 3sigma, possibly due to the low fluxes of precursors. Finally, the PDS continuum properties of both the precursors and main emissions are also studied for the first time, and no significant difference is found in the distributions of the PDS slope for precursors and main emissions in both SGRBs and LGRBs.

title: Particle Injection and Nonthermal Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Magnetic Reconnection
authors: Omar French, Fan Guo, Qile Zhang, Dmitri Uzdensky
topic: Magnetic reconnection in the relativistic regime has been proposed as an important process for the efficient production of nonthermal particles and high-energy emissions. Using fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate how guide-field strength and domain size affect characteristic spectral features and acceleration processes. We study two stages of acceleration: energization up until the injection energy Gamma-inj and further acceleration that generates a power-law spectrum. Stronger guide fields increase the power-law index and gamma-inj, which suppresses acceleration efficiency. These quantities seemingly converge with increasing domain size, suggesting that our findings can be extended to large-scale systems. We find that three distinct mechanisms contribute to acceleration during injection: particle streaming along the parallel electric field, Fermi reflection, and the pickup process. Fermi and pickup processes, related to the electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field, govern the injection for weak guide fields and larger domains. Meanwhile, parallel electric fields are important for injection in the strong guide field regime. In the post-injection stage, we find that perpendicular electric fields dominate particle acceleration in the weak guide field regime, whereas parallel electric fields control acceleration for strong guide fields. These findings will help explain the nonthermal acceleration and emissions in high-energy astrophysics, including black hole jets and pulsar wind nebulae.

title: Interpretation of multi-TeV photons from GRB221009A
authors: Ali Baktash, Dieter Horns, Manuel Meyer 
topic: The nearby GRB22109A at redshift z=0.1505 has been observed up to a maximum energy of 18 TeV with the LHAASO air shower array. The expected optical depth for a photon with energy Egamma=18 TeV varies between 9.2 and 27.1 according to existing models of the extra-galactic background light (EBL) in the relevant mid infra-red range. The resulting suppression of the flux in several EBL models makes it unlikely that this photon could have been observed. If the photon event and its energy are confirmed and possibly even more photons above 10 TeV have been observed, the photon-pair production process would have to be suppressed by mechanisms predicted in extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. We consider the possibilities of photon mixing with a light pseudo-scalar (e.g., axion-like particles; ALPs) in the magnetic field of the host galaxy and the Milky Way and Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). In the case of photon-ALP mixing, the boost factor would reach values 106 for photon couplings not ruled out by the CAST experiment. In the case of LIV, required boost factors are achievable for a LIV breaking energy scale 1029 eV (3 1021 eV) for the linear (quadratic) modification of the dispersion relation. A more simple explanation would be a misidentification of a charged cosmic-ray air shower.

title: Optical measurement of superluminal motion in the neutron-star merger GW170817
authors: Kunal P. Mooley (Caltech, NRAO), Jay Anderson (STSci), Wenbin Lu (Caltech, Princeton, Berkeley)
topic: The afterglow of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 gave evidence for a structured relativistic jet and a link between such mergers and short gamma-ray bursts. Superluminal motion, found using radio very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), together with the afterglow light curve provided constraints on the viewing angle (14-28 degrees), the opening angle of the jet core (less than about 5 degrees), and a modest limit on the initial Lorentz factor of the jet core (more than 4). Here we report on another superluminal motion measurement, at seven times the speed of light, leveraging Hubble Space Telescope precision astrometry and previous radio VLBI data of GW170817. We thereby obtain a unique measurement of the Lorentz factor of the wing of the structured jet, as well as substantially improved constraints on the viewing angle (19-25 degrees) and the initial Lorentz factor of the jet core (more than 40).

Rastinejad, Dylaan Cornish, Sarah Popp, Maura Lally, Anya E. Nugent, Kerry Paterson, Brian D. Metzger, Ryan Chornock, Kate Alexander, Yvette Cendes, Tarraneh Eftekhari
topic: We present a comprehensive study of 29 short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) observed 0.8-60 days post-burst using Chandra and XMM−Newton. We provide the inferred distributions of SGRB jet opening angles and true event rates to compare against neutron star merger rates. We perform uniform analysis and modeling of their afterglows, obtaining 10 opening angle measurements and 19 lower limits. We report on two new opening angle measurements (SGRBs 050724A and 200411A) and eight updated values, obtaining a median value of [] (68\% confidence on the full distribution) from jet measurements alone. For the remaining events, we infer Thetaj=0.5-26. We uncover a population of SGRBs with wider jets of Theta j 10 (including two measurements of Thetaj larger 15deg), representing 28\% of our sample. Coupled with multi-wavelength afterglow information, we derive a total true energy of ⟨Etrue,tot⟩=1049-1050\,erg which is consistent with MHD jet launching mechanisms. Furthermore, we determine a range for the beaming-corrected event rate of Rtrue=360-1800 Gpc-3 yr-1, set by the inclusion of a population of wide jets on the low end, and the jet measurements alone on the high end. From a comparison with the latest merger rates, our results are consistent with the majority of SGRBs originating from binary neutron star mergers. However, our inferred rates are well above the latest neutron star-black hole merger rates, consistent with at most a small fraction of SGRBs originating from such mergers.

title: General relativistic simulations of collapsing binary neutron star mergers with Monte-Carlo neutrino transport
authors: Francois Foucart, Matthew D. Duez, Roland Haas, Lawrence E. Kidder, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel, Elizabeth Spira-Savett
topic: Recent gravitational wave observations of neutron star-neutron star and neutron star-black hole binaries appear to indicate that massive neutron stars may not be too uncommon in merging systems. These discoveries have led to an increased interest in the simulation of merging compact binaries involving massive stars. In this manuscript, we present a first set of evolution of massive neutron star binaries using Monte-Carlo radiation transport for the evolution of neutrinos. We study a range of systems, from nearly symmetric binaries that collapse to a black hole before forming a disk or ejecting material, to more asymmetric binaries in which tidal disruption of the lower mass star leads to the production of more interesting post-merger remnants. For the latter type of systems, we additionally study the impact of viscosity on the properties of the outflows, and compare our results to two recent simulations of identical binaries performed with the WhiskyTHC code. We find excellent agreement on the black hole properties, disk mass, and mass and velocity of the outflows, and some minor but noticeable differences in the evolution of the electron fraction when using a subgrid viscosity model. The method used to account for r-process heating in the determination of the outflow properties appears to have a larger impact on our result than those differences between numerical codes. We also take advantage of the use of a Monte-Carlo code to study in more detail the neutrino energy spectrum, and use the simulation with the most ejected material to verify that our newly implemented Lagrangian tracers provide a reasonable sampling of the matter outflows as they leave the computational grid.

title: Three-dimensional core-collapse supernovae with complex magnetic structures: II. Rotational instabilities and multimessenger signatures
authors: Matteo Bugli, Jérôme Guilet, Thierry Foglizzo, Martin Obergaulinger
topic: The gravitational collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars can lead to the onset of the low T/W instability within the central proto-neutron star (PNS), which leaves strong signatures in both the gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino emission. Strong large-scale magnetic fields are usually invoked to explain outstanding stellar explosions of rapidly rotating progenitors, but their impact on the growth of such instability has not yet been cleared. We analyze a series of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic models to characterize the effects of different magnetic configurations on the development of the low T/W and the related multi-messenger features. In the absence of magnetic fields, we observe the growth on dynamical time scales of the low T/W, associated with a strong burst of GW and a correlated modulation of the neutrino emission. However, models with a strong magnetic field show a quenching of the low T/W, due to a flattening of the rotation profile in the first 100 ms after shock formation caused by the magnetic transport of angular momentum. The associated GW emission is weakened by an order of magnitude, exhibits a broader spectral shape, and has no dominant feature associated with the PNS large-scale oscillation modes. Neutrino luminosities are damped along the equatorial plane due to a more oblate PNS, and the only clear modulation in the signal is due to SASI activity. Finally, magnetized models produce lower luminosities for nu-e than for nu-minus-e, which is connected to a higher concentration of neutron-rich material in the PNS surroundings.

authors: Wenjie Zhang, Xinwen Shu, Jin-Hong Chen, Luming Sun, Rong-Feng Shen, Lian Tao, Chun Chen, Ning Jiang, LiMing Dou, Ying Qin, Xue-Guang Zhang, Liang Zhang, Jinlu Qu, Tinggui Wang
topic: The fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) are a new population of extragalactic transients of unclear physical origin. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed including failed supernova explosion, shock interaction with a dense medium, young magnetar, accretion onto a compact object, and stellar tidal disruption event, but none is conclusive. Here we report the discovery of a possible X-ray quasi-periodicity signal with a period of 250 second (at a significance level of 99.76\%) in the brightest FBOT AT2018cow through the analysis of XMM-Newton/PN data. The signal is independently detected at the same frequency in the average power density spectrum from data taken from the Swift telescope, with observations covering from 6 to 37 days after the optical discovery, though the significance level is lower (94.26\%). This suggests that the QPO frequency may be stable over at least 1.1x104 cycles. Assuming the 250 second QPO to be a scaled-down analogue of that typically seen in stellar mass black holes, a black hole mass of 103−105 solar masses could be inferred. The overall X-ray luminosity evolution could be modeled with the stellar tidal disruption by a black hole of 104 solar masses, providing a viable mechanism to produce AT2018cow. Our findings suggest that other bright FBOTs may also harbor intermediate-mass black holes.

title: Exploring Anisotropic Lorentz Invariance Violation from the Spectral-Lag Transitions of Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Jin-Nan Wei, Zi-Ke Liu, Jun-Jie Wei, Bin-Bin Zhang, Xue-Feng Wu
topic: The observed spectral lags of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been widely used to explore possible violations of Lorentz invariance. However, these studies were generally performed by concentrating on the rough time lag of a single highest-energy photon and ignoring the intrinsic time lag at the source. A new way to test nonbirefringent Lorentz-violating effects has been proposed by analyzing the multi-photon spectral-lag behavior of a GRB that displays a positive-to-negative transition. This method gives both a plausible description of the intrinsic energy-dependent time lag and comparatively robust constraints on Lorentz-violating effects. In this work, we conduct a systematic search for Lorentz-violating photon dispersion from the spectral-lag transition features of 32 GRBs. By fitting the spectral-lag data of these 32 GRBs, we place constraints on a variety of isotropic and anisotropic Lorentz-violating coefficients with mass dimension d=6 and 8. While our dispersion constraints are not competitive with existing bounds, they have the promise to complement the full coefficient space.

title: The closure relations in optical afterglow of Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: M.G.Dainotti, D.Levine, D.Warren, N.Fraija, S.Sourav
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are extremely high-energy events that can be observed at very high redshift. In addition to gamma rays, they can emit in X-ray, optical, and sometimes radio wavelengths. Here, following the approach in Srinivasaragavan et al. (2020); Dainotti et al. (2021b,c), and Dainotti et al (2022, submitted), we consider 82 GRBs from Dainotti et al. (2022a) that have been observed in optical wavelengths and fitted with a broken power law (BPL). We consider the relations between the spectral and temporal indices (closure relations; CRs) according to the synchrotron forward-shock model evolving in the constant-density interstellar medium (ISM; k = 0) and the stellar Wind environment (k = 2) in both slow- and fast-cooling regimes, where the density profile is defined as n is proportional to r to the power minus k. We find the nu exceeds max nuc, nu m regime is most favored, where nu c and nu m are the cooling and characteristic frequencies, respectively. Finally, we test the 2D Dainotti correlation between the rest-frame end time of the plateau and the luminosity at that time on GRBs that fulfill the most-favored CRs. When we compare the intrinsic scatter sigma int of those 2D correlations to the scatter presented in Dainotti et al. (2020b, 2022a), we see the scatters of our correlations generally agree with the previous values within 1sigma, both before and after correction for selection bias. This new information has helped us to pinpoint subsamples of GRBs with features that could drive the GRB emission mechanism, and eventually allow for GRBs to be used as standard candles

title: State-of-the-Art Collapsar Jet Simulations Imply Undetectable Subphotospheric Neutrinos
authors: Ersilia Guarini, Irene Tamborra, Ore Gottlieb
topic: Mounting evidence suggests that the launching of collapsar jets is magnetically driven. Recent general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of collapsars reveal that the jet is continuously loaded with baryons, owing to strong mixing with the cocoon. This results in a high photosphere at 1012 cm. Consequently, collisionless internal shocks below the photosphere are disfavored, and the neutrino production in the deepest jet regions is prevented, in contrast to what has been naively assumed in the literature. We find that subphotospheric neutrino production could only take place in the presence of collisionless sub-shocks or magnetic reconnection. Efficient particle acceleration is not possible in the cocoon, at the cocoon-counter cocoon shock interface, or at the shock driven by the cocoon in the event of a jet halted in an extended envelope. These subphotospheric neutrinos have energy Enu less 105 GeV for initial jet magnetizations Sigma-0=15-2000. More than one neutrino and antineutrino event is expected to be observed in Hyper-Kamiokande and IceCube DeepCore for sources located at z less (0.1) only; considering the collapsar rate, this implies that the detection chances are poor. Because of their energy, these neutrinos do not contribute to the diffuse flux detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Our findings have implications on neutrino searches ranging from gamma-ray bursts to luminous fast blue optical transients.

title: JetCurry I. Reconstructing Three-Dimensional Jet Geometry from Two-Dimensional Images
authors: Sailee M. Sawant, Katie Kosak, Kunyang Li, Sayali S. Avachat, Eric S. Perlman, Debasis Mitra
topic: We present a three-dimensional (3-D) visualization of jet geometry using numerical methods based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) optimized algorithm. Our aim is to visualize the 3-D geometry of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet using observations, which are inherently two-dimensional (2-D) images. Many AGN jets display complex structures that include hotspots and bends. The structure of these bends in the jet's frame may appear quite different than what we see in the sky frame, where it is transformed by our particular viewing geometry. The knowledge of the intrinsic structure will be helpful in understanding the appearance of the magnetic field and hence emission and particle acceleration processes over the length of the jet. We present the JetCurry algorithm to visualize the jet's 3-D geometry from its 2-D image. We discuss the underlying geometrical framework and outline the method used to decompose the 2-D image. We report the results of our 3-D visualization of the jet of M87, using the test case of the knot D region. Our 3-D visualization is broadly consistent with the expected double helical magnetic field structure of the knot D region of the jet. We also discuss the next steps in the development of the JetCurry algorithm.

title: Jet Gravitational Waves
authors: Tsvi Piran
topic: The acceleration of a jet to relativistic velocities produces a unique memory type gravitational waves (GW) signal: {\it Jet-GW}. I discuss here resent result concerning properties of these GWs and consider their detectability in current and proposed detectors. Classical sources are long and short Gamma-ray bursts as well as hidden jets in core-collapse supernovae. Detection of jet-GWs from these sources will require detectors, such as the proposed BBO, DECIGO and lunar based detectors, that will operate in the deciHz band. The current LVK detectors could detect jet-GWs from a Galactic SGR flare if it is sufficiently asymmetric. Once detected these signals could reveal information concerning jet acceleration and collimation that cannot be explored otherwise.

title: Proton Synchrotron Origin of the Very High Energy Emission of GRB 190114C
authors: Hebzibha Isravel, Asaf Pe'er, Damien Begue
topic: We consider here a proton-synchrotron model to explain the MAGIC observation of GRB 190114C afterglow in the energy band 0.2-1 TeV, while the X-ray spectra are explained by electron-synchrotron emission. Given the uncertainty of the particle acceleration process, we consider several variations of the model, and show that they all match the data very well. We find that the values of the uncertain model parameters are reasonable: explosion energy 1054.5 erg, ambient density 10-100cm-3, and fraction of electrons/ protons accelerated to a high energy power law of a few per-cents. All these values are directly derived from the observed TeV and X-ray fluxes. They are consistent with both late time data at all bands, from radio to X-rays, and with numerical models of particle acceleration. Our results thus demonstrate the relevance of proton-synchrotron emission to the high energy observations of GRBs during their afterglow phase.

title: Cocoon emission in neutron star mergers
authors: Hamid Hamidani, Kunihito Ioka
topic: In the gravitational wave event GW170817, there was a 10 hours gap before electromagnetic (EM) observations, without detection of the cocoon. The cocoon is heated by a \textit{short} gamma-ray burst (\textit{s}GRB) jet propagating through the ejecta of a Neutron Star (NS) merger, and a part of the cocoon escapes the ejecta with an opening angle of 20--30deg. Here we model the cocoon and calculate its EM emission. Our 2D hydrodynamic simulations suggest that the density and energy distributions, after entering homologous expansion, are well-fitted with power-law functions, in each of the relativistic and non-relativistic parts of the escaped cocoon. Modeling these features, we calculate the cooling emission analytically. We find that the cocoon outshines the r-process kilonova/macronova at early times (10--103 s), peaking at UV bands. The relativistic velocity of the cocoon's photosphere is measurable with instruments such as Swift and ULTRASAT. We also imply that energetic cocoons, including failed jets, might be detected as X-ray flashes. Our model clarifies the physics and parameter dependence, covering a wide variety of central engines and ejecta of NS mergers and \textit{s}GRBs in the multi-messenger era.

title: Explosive nucleosynthesis with fast neutrino-flavor conversion in core-collapse supernovae
authors: Shin-ichiro Fujimoto, Hiroki Nagakura
topic: Fast neutrino-flavor conversion (FFC) is a possible game-changing ingredient in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) theory. In this Letter, we examine the impact of FFC on explosive nucleosynthesis by including the effects of FFC in conjunction with asymmetric neutrino emission into nucleosynthetic computations in a parametric way. We find that the ejecta compositions are not appreciably affected by FFC for elements lighter than Co, while the compositions are influenced by FFC for the heavier elements. We also find that the role of FFC varies depending on the asymmetric degree of neutrino emission (masy) and the degree of neutrino-flavor mixing. The impact of FFC is not monotonic to masy; The change in the ejecta composition increases for higher masy up to 10\% compared with that without FFC, whereas FFC has little effect on the nucleosynthesis in very large asymmetric neutrino emission (above 30\%). Our results suggest that FFC facilitates the production of neutron-rich ejecta in most cases, although it makes the ejecta more proton-rich if anti-neutrino conversion is more vigorous than that of neutrino. The key ingredient accounting for this trend is neutrino absorption, whose effects on nucleosynthesis can be quantified by simple diagnostics.

authors: Martin Lemoine 
topic: This work provides a concrete implementation of E. Fermi's model of particle acceleration in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, connecting the rate of energization to the gradients of the velocity of magnetic field lines, which it characterizes within a multifractal picture of turbulence intermittency. It then derives a transport equation in momentum space for the distribution function. This description is shown to be substantiated by a large-scale numerical simulation of strong MHD turbulence. The present, general framework can be used to model particle acceleration in a variety of environments.

title: Cocoon breakout and escape from the ejecta of neutron star mergers
authors: Hamid Hamidani, Kunihito Ioka
topic: The cocoon is an inevitable product of a jet propagating through ambient matter, and takes a fair fraction of the jet energy. In short gamma-ray bursts, the ambient matter is the ejecta, from the merger of neutron stars, expanding with a high velocity 0.2c, in contrast to the static stellar envelope in collapsars. Using 2D relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with the ejecta density profile as rgo-r-2, we find that the expansion makes a big difference; only 0.5--5\% of the cocoon mass escapes from (faster than) the ejecta, with an opening angle 20--30 deg, while it is 100\% and spherical in collapsars. We also analytically obtain the shares of mass and energies for the escaped and trapped cocoons. Because the mass of the escaped cocoon is small and the trapped cocoon being concealed by the ejecta and the escaped cocoon, we conclude that it is unlikely that the cocoon emission was observed as a counterpart to the gravitational wave event GW170817.

title: Prompt Emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts in the High-density Environment of Active Galactic Nuclei Accretion Disks
authors: Davide Lazzati, Gustavo Soares, Rosalba Perna
topic: Long and short gamma-ray bursts are traditionally associated with galactic environments, where circumburst densities are small or moderate (few to hundreds of protons per cubic cm). However, both are also expected to occur in the disks of Active Galactic Nuclei, where the ambient medium density can be much larger. In this work we study, via semi-analytical methods, the propagation of the GRB outflow, its interaction with the external material, and the ensuing prompt radiation. In particular, we focus on the case in which the external shock develops early in the evolution, at a radius that is smaller than the internal shock one. We find that bursts in such high density environments are likely characterized by a single, long emission episode that is due to the superposition of individual pulses, with a characteristic hard to soft evolution irrespective of the light curve luminosity. While multi-pulse light curves are not impossible, they would require the central engine to go dormant for a long time before re-igniting. In addition, short GRB engines would produce bursts with prompt duration that would exceed the canonical 2 s separation threshold and would likely be incorrectly classified as long events, even though they would not be accompanied by a simultaneous supernova. Finally, these events have a large dynamical efficiency which would produce a bright prompt emission followed by a somewhat dim afterglow.

title: Abundances and Transients from Neutron Star-White Dwarf Mergers
authors: Mark Alexander Kaltenborn, Chris L. Fryer, Ryan T. Wollaeger, Krzysztof Belczynski, Wesley Even, Chryssa Kouveliotou
topic: We systematically investigate the mergers of neutron star-white dwarf binaries from beginning to end, with focus on the properties of the inflows and outflows in accretion disks and their electromagnetic emissions. Using population synthesis models, we determine a subset of these binaries in which the white dwarf companion undergoes unstable mass transfer and complete tidal disruption, forming a large accretion disk around the neutron star. The material evolves according to an advection-dominated accretion disk model with nuclear burning, neutrino-emissions, and disk-surface wind ejection. The extreme dynamics of the entire process has proven difficult for analytic analysis, and thus currently the properties are poorly understood. The outflows from the mergers are iron- and nickel-rich, giving rise to optical and infrared emissions powered from the decay of the radioactive iron-type isotopes, calculated via the SuperNu light-curve code. We find these systems capable of powering bright, yet short-lived, optical transients with the potential to power gamma-ray bursts.

title: Electron Re-acceleration via Ion Cyclotron Waves in the Intracluster Medium
authors: Aaron Tran, Lorenzo Sironi, Francisco Ley, Ellen G. Zweibel, Mario A. Riquelme
topic: In galaxy clusters, the intracluster medium (ICM) is expected to host a diffuse, long-lived, and invisible population of "fossil" cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) with 1-100 MeV energies. These CRe, if "re-accelerated" by 100x in energy, can contribute synchrotron luminosity to cluster radio halos, relics, and phoenices. Re-acceleration may be aided by CRe scattering upon the ion-Larmor-scale waves that spawn when ICM is compressed, dilated, or sheared. We study CRe scattering and energy gain due to ion cyclotron (IC) waves generated by continuously-driven compression in 1D fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. We find that pitch-angle scattering of CRe by IC waves induces energy gain via magnetic pumping. In an optimal range of IC-resonant momenta, CRe may gain up to 10-30% of their initial energy in one compress/dilate cycle with magnetic field amplification 1-6x, assuming adiabatic decompression without further scattering and averaging over initial pitch angle.

title: Actinide opacities for modeling the spectra and light curves of kilonovae
authors: C.J. Fontes, C.L. Fryer, R.T. Wollaeger, M.R. Mumpower, T.M. Sprouse
topic: We extend previous ab initio calculations of lanthanide opacities (Fontes et al., 2020, MNRAS, 493, 4143) to include a complete set of actinide opacities for use in the modeling of kilonova light curves and spectra. Detailed, fine-structure line features are generated using the configuration-interaction approach. These actinide opacities display similar trends to those observed for lanthanide opacities, such as the lighter actinides producing higher opacity than the heavier ones for relevant conditions in the dynamical ejecta. A line-binned treatment is employed to pre-compute opacity tables for 14 actinide elements (89less Z less102) over a grid of relevant temperatures and densities. These tabular opacities will be made publicly available for general usage in kilonova modeling. We demonstrate the usefulness of these opacities in kilonova simulations by exploring the sensitivity of light curves and spectra to different actinide abundance distributions that are predicted by different nuclear theories, as well as to different choices of ejecta mass and velocity. We find very little sensitivity to the two considered distributions, indicating that opacities for actinides with Z above 99 do not contribute strongly. On the other hand, a single actinide element, protactinium, is found to produce faint spectral features in the far infrared at late times (5-7 days post merger). More generally, we find that the choice of ejecta mass and velocity have the most significant effect on KN emission for this study.

title: Properties of the Prompt Optical Counterpart Arising from the Cooling of Electrons in Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: A.D. Panaitescu, W.T. Vestrand
topic: This work extends a contemporaneous effort (Panaitescu & Vestrand 2022) to study the properties of the lower-energy counterpart synchrotron emission produced by the cooling of relativistic Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) electrons through radiation (synchrotron and self-Compton) emission and adiabatic losses. We derive the major characteristics (pulse duration, lag-time after burst, brightness relative to the burst) of the Prompt Optical Counterpart (POC) accompanying GRBs. Depending on the magnetic field life-time, duration of electron injection, and electron transit-time Dto from hard X-ray (GRB) to optical emitting energies, a (true) POC may appear during the GRB pulse (of duration dtg) or after (delayed OC). The signature of counterparts arising from the cooling of GRB electrons is that true POC pulses (Dto < dtg) last as long as the corresponding GRB pulse (dto  dtg) while delayed OC pulses (Dto > dtg) last as long as the transit-time (dto ~ Dto). If OC variability can be measured, then another signature for this OC mechanism is that the GRB variability is "passed" only to POCs but is lost for delayed OCs. Within the GRB electron cooling model for counterparts, POCs should be on average dimmer than delayed one (which is found to be consistent with the data), and harder GRB low-energy slopes bLE should be associated more often with the dimmer POCs The range of low-energy slopes bLE in [-1/2,1/3] produced by electron cooling and the average burst brightness of 1 mJy (with 1 dex dispersion) imply that POCs of hard GRBs can be dimmer than R=20 and difficult to detect by robotic telescopes (unless there is another mechanism that overshines the emission from cooling electrons) and that the POCs of soft GRBs can be brighter than R=10, i.e. as bright as the Optical Flashes (OFs) seen for several bursts.

title: The effects of self-interacting bosonic dark matter on neutron star properties
authors: Edoardo Giangrandi, Violetta Sagun, Oleksii Ivanytskyi, Constança Providência, Tim Dietrich
topic: We propose a model of asymmetric bosonic dark matter (DM) with self-repulsion mediated by the vector field coupled to the complex scalar particles. By adopting the two-fluid formalism, we study different DM distribution regimes, either, fully condensed inside the core of a star or, otherwise, distributed in a dilute halo around a neutron star (NS). We show that DM condensed in a core leads to a decrease of the total gravitational mass, radius and tidal deformability compared to a pure baryonic star with the same central density, which we will perceive as an effective softening of the equation of state (EoS). On the other hand, the presence of a DM halo increases the tidal deformability and total gravitational mass. As a result, an accumulated DM inside compact stars could mimic an apparent stiffening of strongly interacting matter equation of state and constraints we impose on it at high densities.
From the performed analysis of the effect of DM particles in a MeV-GeV mass-scale, interaction strength, and relative DM fractions inside NSs we obtained a rigorous constraint on model parameters. Finally, we discuss several smoking guns of the presence of DM that are free from the above mentioned apparent modification of the strongly interacting matter equation of state. With this we could be probed with the future astrophysical and gravitational wave (GW) surveys.

title: The Synchrotron Low-Energy Spectrum Arising from the Cooling of Electrons in Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: A.D. Panaitescu, W.T. Vestrand
topic: This work is a continuation of a previous effort (Panaitescu 2019) to study the cooling of relativistic electrons through radiation (synchrotron and self-Compton) emission and adiabatic losses, with application to the spectra and light-curves of the synchrotron Gamma-Ray Burst produced by such cooling electrons. Here, we derive the low-energy slope bLE of GRB pulse-integrated spectrum and quantify the implications of the measured distribution of bLE. If the magnetic field lives longer than it takes the cooling GRB electrons to radiate below 1-10 keV, then radiative cooling processes of power P(gamma) - gamma to n with n geq 2, i.e. synchrotron and inverse-Compton (iC) through Thomson scatterings, lead to a soft low-energy spectral slope bLE leq -1/2 of the GRB pulse-integrated spectrum Feps - eps{b_LE} below the peak-energy Ep, irrespective of the duration of electron injection ti. IC-cooling dominated by scatterings at the Thomson--Klein-Nishina transition of synchrotron photons below Ep has an index n = 2/3 -> 1 and yield harder integrated spectra with bLE in [0,1/6], while adiabatic electron-cooling leads to a soft slope bLE = -3/4. Radiative processes that produce soft integrated spectra can accommodate the harder slopes measured by CGRO/BATSE and Fermi/GBM only if the magnetic field life-time tB is shorter than the time during which the typical GRB electrons cool to radiate below 1-10 keV, which is less than (at most) ten radiative cooling timescales trad of the typical GRB electron. In this case, there is a one-to-one correspondence between tB and bLE. To account for low-energy slopes b_LE > -3/4, adiabatic electron-cooling requires a similar restriction on tB. In this case, the diversity of slopes arises mostly from how the electron-injection rate varies with time and not from the magnetic field timescale.

title: Extracting nuclear matter properties from neutron star matter EoS using deep neural networks
authors: Márcio Ferreira, Valéria Carvalho, Constança Providência
topic: The extraction of the nuclear matter properties from neutron star observations is nowadays an important issue, in particular, the properties that characterize the symmetry energy which are essential to describe correctly asymmetric nuclear matter. We use deep neural networks (DNN) to map the relation between cold β-equilibrium neutron star matter and the nuclear matter properties. Assuming a quadratic dependence on the isospin asymmetry for the energy per particle of homogeneous nuclear matter and using a Taylor expansion up to fourth order in the iso-scalar and iso-vector contributions, we generate a dataset of different realizations of β-equilibrium NS matter and the corresponding nuclear matter properties. The DNN model was successfully trained, attaining great accuracy in the test set. Finally, a real case scenario was used to test the DNN model, where a set of 33 nuclear models, obtained within a relativistic mean field approach or a Skyrme force description, were fed into the DNN model and the corresponding nuclear matter parameters recovered with considerable accuracy, in particular, the standard deviations sigma(Lsym)=12.85 MeV and σ(Ksat)=41.02 MeV were obtained, respectively, for the slope of the symmetry energy and the nuclear matter incompressibility at saturation.

topic: The equation of state (EoS) that describes extremely dense matter under strong interactions is not completely understood. One reason is that the first-principle calculations of the EoS at finite chemical potential are challenging in nuclear physics. However, neutron star observables like masses, radii, moment of inertia and tidal deformability are direct probes to the EoS and hence make the EoS reconstruction task feasible. In this work, we present results from a novel deep learning technique that optimizes a parameterized equation of state in the automatic differentiation framework. We predict stellar structures from a pre-trained Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) solver network, given an EoS represented by neural networks. The latest observational data of neutron stars, specifically their masses and radii, are used to implement the chi-square fitting. We optimize the parameters of the neural network EoS by minimizing the error between observations and predictions. The well-trained neural network EoS gives an estimate of the relationship between the pressure and the mass density. The results presented are consistent with those from conventional approaches and the experimental bound on the tidal deformability inferred from the gravitational wave event, GW170817.

title: Impact of large-mass constraints on the properties of neutron stars
authors: Christian Ecker, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: The maximum mass of a nonrotating neutron star, MTOV, plays a very important role in deciphering the structure and composition of neutron stars and in revealing the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter. Although with a large-error bar, the recent mass estimate for the black-widow binary pulsar PSR J0952-0607, i.e. M=2.35pm0.17 Msun, provides the strongest lower bound on MTOV and suggests that neutron stars with very large masses can in principle be observed. Adopting an agnostic modelling of the EOS, we study the impact that large masses have on the neutron-star properties. In particular, we show that assuming MTOV larger 2.35Msun constrains tightly the behaviour of the pressure as a function of the energy density and moves the lower bounds for the stellar radii to values that are significantly larger than those constrained by the NICER measurements, rendering the latter ineffective in constraining the EOS. We also provide updated analytic expressions for the lower bound on the binary tidal deformability in terms of the chirp mass and show how larger bounds on MTOV lead to tighter constraints for this quantity. In addition, we point out a novel quasi-universal relation for the pressure profile inside neutron stars that is only weakly dependent from the EOS and the maximum-mass constraint. Finally, we study how the sound speed and the conformal anomaly are distributed inside neutron stars and show how these quantities depend on the imposed maximum-mass constraints.

title: Resonant Production of Light Sterile Neutrinos in Compact Binary Merger Remnants
authors: Garðar Sigurðarson, Irene Tamborra, Meng-Ru Wu
topic: The existence of eV-mass sterile neutrinos is not ruled out because of persistent experimental anomalies. Upcoming multi-messenger detections of neutron-star merger remnants could provide indirect constraints on the existence of these particles. We explore the active-sterile flavor conversion phenomenology in a two-flavor scenario (1 active + 1 sterile species) as a function of the sterile neutrino mixing parameters, neutrino emission angle from the accretion torus, and temporal evolution of the merger remnant. The torus geometry and the neutron richness of the remnant are responsible for the occurrence of multiple resonant active-sterile conversions. The number of resonances strongly depends on the neutrino emission direction above or inside the remnant torus and leads to large production of sterile neutrinos (and no antineutrinos) in the proximity of the polar axis as well as more sterile antineutrinos than neutrinos in the equatorial region. As the black hole torus evolves in time, the shallower baryon density is responsible for more adiabatic flavor conversion, leading to larger regions of the mass-mixing parameter space being affected by flavor mixing. Our findings imply that the production of sterile states can have indirect implications on the disk cooling rate, its outflows, and related electromagnetic observables which remain to be assessed.

title: RAPOC : the Rosseland and Planck opacity converter. A user-friendly and fast opacity program for Python
authors: Lorenzo V. Mugnai, Darius Modirrousta-Galian
topic: RAPOC (Rosseland and Planck Opacity Converter) is a Python 3 code that calculates Rosseland and Planck mean opacities (RPMs) from wavelength-dependent opacities for a given temperature, pressure, and wavelength range. In addition to being user-friendly and rapid, RAPOC can interpolate between discrete data points, making it flexible and widely applicable to the astrophysical and Earth-sciences fields, as well as in engineering. For the input data, RAPOC can use ExoMol and DACE data, or any user-defined data, provided that it is in a readable format. In this paper, we present the RAPOC code and compare its calculated Rosseland and Planck mean opacities with other values found in the literature. The RAPOC code is open-source and available on Pypi and GitHub.

title: Propagation of a realistic magnetar jet through binary neutron star merger environment and implications for short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Gustavo Soares, Pablo Bosch, Davide Lazzati, Philipp Mösta
topic: The origin of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) is associated with outflows powered by the remnant of a binary neutron star merger. This remnant can be either a black hole or a highly magnetized, fastly spinning neutron star, also known as a magnetar. Here, we present the results of two relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations aimed at investigating the large-scale dynamics and propagation of magnetar collimated outflows through the environment surrounding the remnant. The first simulation evolves a realistic jet by injecting external simulation data, while the second evolves an analytical model jet with similar properties for comparison. We find that both outflows remain collimated and successfully emerge through the environment. However, they fail to attain relativistic velocities and only reach a mean maximum speed of 0.7c for the realistic jet, and 0.6c for the analytical jet. We also find that the realistic jet has a much more complex structure. The lack of highly relativistic speeds, that makes these jets unsuitable as short GRB sources, appears to be due to the specific injected properties and not general to all possible magnetar outflows.

topic: Our limited understanding of the physical properties of matter at ultra-high density, high proton/neutron number asymmetry, and low temperature is presently one of the major outstanding problems in physics. As matter in this extreme state is known to only exist stably in the cores of neutron stars (NSs), complementary measurements from electromagnetic and gravitational wave astrophysical observations of NSs, combined with terrestrial laboratory constraints and further theoretical investigations, hold the promise to provide important insight into the properties of matter in a region of the quantum chromodynamics phase space that is otherwise inaccessible. This multidisciplinary endeavor imposes the following requirements for facilities and resources in the upcoming decade and beyond: - A next generation of gravitational wave detectors to uncover more double NS and neutron star-black hole mergers; - Sensitive radio telescopes to find the most massive and fastest spinning NSs; - Large-area, high-time-resolution and/or high angular resolution X-ray telescopes to constrain the NS mass-radius relation; - Suitable laboratory facilities for nuclear physics experiments to constrain the dense matter equation of state; - Funding resources for theoretical studies of matter in this regime; - The availability of modern large-scale high performance computing infrastructure.
The same facilities and resources would also enable significant advances in other high-profile fields of inquiry in modern physics such as the nature of dark matter, alternative theories of gravity, nucleon superfluidity and superconductivity, as well as an array of astrophysics, including but not limited to stellar evolution, nucleosynthesis, and primordial black holes.

title: Spectroscopic r-Process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae I: The Inferred Abundance Pattern of Early Emission from GW170817
authors: Nicholas Vieira, John J. Ruan, Daryl Haggard, Nicole Ford, Maria R. Drout, Rodrigo Fernández, N. R. Badnell
topic: Freshly-synthesized r-process elements in kilonovae ejecta imprint absorption features on optical spectra, as observed in the GW170817 binary neutron star merger. These spectral features encode insights into the physical conditions of the r-process and the origins of the ejected material, but associating features with particular elements and inferring the resultant abundance pattern is computationally challenging. We introduce Spectroscopic r-Process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae (SPARK), a modular framework to perform Bayesian inference on kilonova spectra with the goals of inferring elemental abundance patterns and identifying absorption features at early times. SPARK inputs an atomic line list and abundance patterns from reaction network calculations into the TARDIS radiative transfer code. It then performs fast Bayesian inference on observed kilonova spectra by training a Gaussian process surrogate for the approximate posteriors of kilonova ejecta parameters, via active learning. We use the spectrum of GW170817 at 1.4 days to perform the first inference on a kilonova spectrum, and recover a complete abundance pattern. Our inference shows that this ejecta was generated by an r-process with either (1) high electron fraction Ye - 0.35 and high entropy s/kB - 25, or, (2) a more moderate Y_e - 0.30 and s/k_B - 14. These parameters are consistent with a shocked, polar dynamical component, and a viscously-driven outflow from a remnant accretion disk, respectively. We also recover previous identifications of strontium absorption at 8000 AA, and tentatively identify yttrium and/or zirconium at less 4500 AA. Our approach will enable computationally-tractable inference on the spectra of future kilonovae discovered through multi-messenger observations.

title: 3D radiative transfer kilonova modelling for binary neutron star merger simulations
authors: Christine E. Collins, Andreas Bauswein, Stuart A. Sim, Vimal Vijayan, Gabriel Martínez-Pinedo, Oliver Just, Luke J. Shingles, Markus Kromer
topic: The detection of GW170817 and the accompanying electromagnetic counterpart, AT2017gfo, have provided an important set of observational constraints for theoretical models of neutron star mergers, nucleosynthesis, and radiative transfer for kilonovae. We apply the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTIS to produce synthetic light curves of the dynamical ejecta from a neutron star merger, which has been modelled with 3D smooth-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and included neutrino interactions. Nucleosynthesis calculations provide the energy released from radioactive decays of r-process nuclei, and radiation transport is performed using grey opacities given as functions of the electron fraction. We present line-of-sight dependent bolometric light curves, and find the emission along polar lines of sight to be up to a factor of 2 brighter than along equatorial lines of sight. Instead of a distinct emission peak, our bolometric light curve exhibits a monotonic decline, characterised by a shoulder at the time when the bulk ejecta becomes optically thin. We show approximate band light curves based on radiation temperatures and compare these to the observations of AT2017gfo. We find that the rapidly declining temperatures lead to a blue to red colour evolution similar to that shown by AT2017gfo. We also investigate the impact of an additional, spherically symmetric secular ejecta component, and we find that the early light curve remains nearly unaffected, while after about 1 day the emission is strongly enhanced and dominated by the secular ejecta, leading to the shift of the shoulder from 1-2 to 6-10 days.

title: Bulk Viscosity of Relativistic npe mu Matter in Neutron-Star Mergers
authors: Mark Alford, Arus Harutyunyan, Armen Sedrakian
topic: We discuss the bulk viscosity of hot and dense npe-mu matter arising from weak-interaction direct Urca processes. We consider two regimes of interest: (a) the neutrino-transparent regime with T less Ttr (Ttr=5pm10 MeV is the neutrino-trapping temperature); and (b) the neutrino-trapped regime with T≥Ttr. Nuclear matter is modeled in relativistic density functional approach with density-dependent parametrization DDME2. The maximum of the bulk viscosity is achieved at temperatures T=5pm6 MeV in the neutrino-transparent regime, then it drops rapidly at higher temperatures where neutrino-trapping occurs. As an astrophysical application, we estimate the damping timescales of density oscillations by the bulk viscosity in neutron star mergers and find that, e.g., at the oscillation frequency f=10 kHz, the damping will be very efficient at temperatures 4lessTless7 MeV where the bulk viscosity might affect the evolution of the post-merger object.

title: Muons in the aftermath of Neutron Star Mergers and their impact on Trapped Neutrinos
authors: Eleonora Loffredo, Albino Perego, Domenico Logoteta, Marica Branchesi
topic: In the upcoming years, present and next-generation gravitational wave observatories will detect a larger number of Binary Neutron Star (BNS) mergers with increasing accuracy. In this context, improving BNS merger numerical simulations is crucial to correctly interpret the data and constrain the Equation of State (EOS) of Neutron Stars (NSs). State-of-the-art simulations of BNS mergers do not include muons. However, muons are known to be relevant in the microphysics of cold NSs and are expected to have a significant role in mergers, where the typical thermodynamics conditions favor their production. Our work aims at investigating the impact of muons on the merger remnant. We post-process the outcome of four numerical relativity simulations, performed with three different baryonic EOSs and two mass ratios, considering the first 15 milliseconds after the merger. We compute the abundance of muons in the remnant and analyse how muons affect the trapped neutrino component and the fluid pressure. We find that the net fraction of muons is between 30\% and 70\% the one of electrons, depending on the baryonic EOS. Muons change the flavour hierarchy of trapped (anti)neutrinos, so that muon anti-neutrinos are the most abundant, followed by electron anti-neutrinos. Finally, muons modify the neutron to proton ratio inducing variations of the remnant pressure up to 7\%. This work demonstrates that muons have a non-negligible effect on the outcome of BNS merger simulations, and they should be included to improve simulations accuracy.

title: Nonthermal Electron Acceleration at Collisionless Quasi-perpendicular Shocks
authors: T. Amano, Y. Matsumoto, A. Bohdan, O. Kobzar, S. Matsukiyo, M. Oka, J. Niemiec, M. Pohl, M. Hoshino
topic: Shock waves propagating in collisionless heliospheric and astrophysical plasmas have been studied extensively over the decades. One prime motivation is to understand the nonthermal particle acceleration at shocks. Although the theory of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) has long been the standard for cosmic-ray acceleration at shocks, plasma physical understanding of particle acceleration remains elusive. In this review, we discuss nonthermal electron acceleration mechanisms at quasi-perpendicular shocks, for which substantial progress has been made in recent years. The discussion presented in this review is restricted to the following three specific topics. The first is stochastic shock drift acceleration (SSDA), which is a relatively new mechanism for electron injection into DSA. The basic mechanism, related in-situ observations and kinetic simulations results, and how it is connected with DSA will be discussed. Second, we discuss shock surfing acceleration (SSA) at very high Mach number shocks relevant to young supernova remnants (SNRs). While the original proposal under the one-dimensional assumption is unrealistic, SSA has now been proven efficient by a fully three-dimensional kinetic simulation. Finally, we discuss the current understanding of the magnetized Weibel-dominated shock. Spontaneous magnetic reconnection of self-generated current sheets within the shock structure is an interesting consequence of Weibel-generated strong magnetic turbulence. We argue that high Mach number shocks with both Alfven and sound Mach numbers exceeding 20-40 will likely behave as a Weibel-dominated shock. Despite a number of interesting recent findings, the relative roles of SSDA, SSA, and magnetic reconnection for electron acceleration at collisionless shocks and how the dominant particle acceleration mechanisms change depending on shock parameters remain to be answered.

topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are flashes of high-energy radiation arising from energetic cosmic explosions. Bursts of long (2 s) duration are produced by the core-collapse of massive stars, those of short (2 s) duration by the merger of two neutron stars (NSs). A third class of events with hybrid high-energy properties was identified, but never conclusively linked to a stellar progenitor. The lack of bright supernovae rules out typical core-collapse explosions, but their distance scales prevent sensitive searches for direct signatures of a progenitor system. Only tentative evidence for a kilonova has been presented. Here we report observations of the exceptionally bright GRB211211A that classify it as a hybrid event and constrain its distance scale to only 346 Mpc. Our measurements indicate that its lower-energy (from ultraviolet to near-infrared) counterpart is powered by a luminous (1E42 erg/s) kilonova possibly formed in the ejecta of a compact binary merger.

title: Neutrino transport in general relativistic neutron star merger simulations
authors: Francois Foucart
topic: Numerical simulations of neutron star-neutron star and neutron star-black hole binaries play an important role in our ability to model gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals powered by these systems. These simulations have to take into account a wide range of physical processes including general relativity, magnetohydrodynamics, and neutrino radiation transport. The latter is particularly important in order to understand the properties of the matter ejected by many mergers, the optical/infrared signals powered by nuclear reactions in the ejecta, and the contribution of that ejecta to astrophysical nucleosynthesis. However, accurate evolutions of the neutrino transport equations that include all relevant physical processes remain beyond our current reach. In this review, I will discuss the current state of neutrino modeling in general relativistic simulations of neutron star mergers and of their post-merger remnants, focusing in particular on the three main types of algorithms used in simulations so far: leakage, moments, and Monte-Carlo scheme. I will discuss the advantages and limitations of each scheme, as well as the various neutrino-matter interactions that should be included in simulations. We will see that the quality of the treatment of neutrinos in merger simulations has greatly increased over the last decade, but also that many potentially important interactions remain difficult to take into account in simulations (pair annihilation, oscillations, inelastic scattering).

authors: Kohsuke Sumiyoshi, Shun Furusawa, Hiroki Nagakura, Akira Harada, Hajime Togashi, Ken'ichiro Nakazato, Hideyuki Suzuki
topic: We study the influence of hot and dense matter in core-collapse supernovae by adopting up-to-date nuclear equation of state (EOS) based on the microscopic nuclear many-body frameworks. We explore effects of EOS based on the Dirac Brueckner Hartree-Fock theory through comparisons with those based on the variational method. We also examine effects of the differences in the composition of nuclei and nucleons by using the same EOS by the variational method but employing two different treatments in computations of nuclear abundances. We perform numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae adopting the three EOSs. We also perform numerical simulations of the long-term evolution over 70 s of the proto-neutron star cooling. We show that impacts by different modeling of composition are remarkable as in those by different treatments of uniform matter in the gravitational collapse, bounce, and shock propagation. The cooling of proto-neutron star and the resulting neutrino emission are also affected by the compositional difference even if the same treatment in computing uniform matter of EOS.

topic: The recently discovered TeV emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) hints towards a possible hadronic origin of this radiation component. We developed a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation reproducing the kinematics of photo-hadronic interactions at internal shocks, including the pair production process that the secondary gamma rays undergo in the GRB jet. We find that sub-TeV observations of GRB 190114C can be reproduced by a baryonic energy content comparable to that in sub-GeV photons and a bulk Lorentz factor Gamma=100, with a ms variability timescale. Neutrino flux predictions by the model are found to be consistent with experimental upper limits set by ANTARES and IceCube.

topic: Close binary systems consisting of two neutron stars (BNS) emit gravitational waves, that allow them to merge on timescales shorter than Hubble time. It is widely believed, that NS-NS mergers in such systems power short gamma-ray bursts (GRB). Several mechanisms which could lead to electromagnetic energy release prior to a merger have been proposed. We estimate the ability to observe the possible pre-burst emission with telescopes of Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma. We also investigate first such event, GRB210919A, which fell into the field of view of the SRG telescopes less than two days before the burst.

topic: We have added support for realistic, microphysical, finite-temperature equations of state (EOS) and neutrino physics via a leakage scheme to IllinoisGRMHD, an open-source GRMHD code for dynamical spacetimes in the Einstein Toolkit. These new features are provided by two new, NRPy+-based codes: NRPyEOS, which performs highly efficient EOS table lookups and interpolations, and NRPyLeakage, which implements a new, AMR-capable neutrino leakage scheme in the Einstein Toolkit. We have performed a series of strenuous validation tests that demonstrate the robustness of these new codes, particularly on the Cartesian AMR grids provided by Carpet. Furthermore, we show results from fully dynamical GRMHD simulations of single unmagnetized neutron stars, and magnetized binary neutron star mergers. This new version of IllinoisGRMHD, as well as NRPyEOS and NRPyLeakage, is pedagogically documented in Jupyter notebooks and fully open source. The codes will be proposed for inclusion in an upcoming version of the Einstein Toolkit.

title: The velocity distribution of outflows driven by choked jets in stellar envelopes
authors: Matteo Pais, Tsvi Piran, Ehud Nakar
topic: Many stripped envelope supernovae (SNe) present a signature of high-velocity material responsible for broad absorption lines in the observed spectrum. These include SNe that are associated with long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and low-luminosity GRBs (llGRBs), and SNe that are not associated with GRBs. Recently it was suggested that this high velocity material originates from a cocoon that is driven by a relativistic jet. In LGRBs this jet breaks out successfully from the stellar envelope, while in llGRBs and SNe that are not associated with GRBs the jet is choked. Here we use numerical simulations to explore the velocity distribution of an outflow that is driven by a choked jet and its dependence on the jet and progenitor properties. We find that in all cases where the jet is not choked too deep within the star, the outflow carries a roughly constant amount of energy per logarithmic scale of proper velocity over a wide range of velocities, which depends mostly on the cocoon volume at the time of its breakout. This is a universal property of jets driven outflows, which does not exist in outflows of spherically symmetric explosions or when the jets are choked very deep within the star. We therefore conclude that jets that are choked (not too deep) provide a natural explanation to the fast material seen in the early spectra of stripped envelope SNe that are not associated with LGRBs and that properties of this material could reveal information on the otherwise hidden jets.

title: Hyperon bulk viscosity and r-modes of neutron stars
authors: O. P. Jyothilakshmi, P. E. Sravan Krishnan, Prashant Thakur, V. Sreekanth, T. K. Jha
topic: We propose and apply a new parameterization of the modified chiral effective model to study rotating neutron stars with hyperon cores in the framework of the relativistic mean-field theory. The inclusion of mesonic cross couplings in the model has improved the density content of the symmetry energy slope parameters, which are in agreement with the findings from recent terrestrial experiments. The bulk viscosity of the hyperonic medium is analyzed to investigate its role in the suppression of gravitationally driven r-modes. The hyperonic bulk viscosity coefficient caused by non-leptonic weak interactions and the corresponding damping timescales are calculated and the r-mode instability windows are obtained. The present model predicts a significant reduction of the unstable region due to a more effective damping of oscillations. We find that from 108 K to 109 K, hyperonic bulk viscosity completely suppresses the r-modes leading to a stable region between the instability windows. Our analysis indicates that the instability can reduce the angular velocity of the star up to 0.3-Ometa K, where OmegaK is the Kepler frequency of the star.

authors: F. Rastegarnia, R. Moradi, J. A. Rueda, R. Ruffini, Liang Li, S. Eslamzadeh, Y. Wang, S. S. Xue
topic: In analogy with GRB 190114C, we here analyze the ultrarelativistic prompt emission (UPE) of GRB 180720B observed in the rest-frame time interval trf=4.84--10.89s by Fermi-GBM. We reveal the UPE hierarchical structure from the time-resolved spectral analysis performed in time sub-intervals: the spectrum in each shorter time interval is always fitted by a composite blackbody plus cutoff power-law model. We explain this structure with the \textit{inner engine} of binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model operating in a quantum electrodynamics (QED) regime. In this regime, the electric field induced by the gravitomagnetic interaction of the newborn Kerr BH with the surrounding magnetic field is overcritical, i.e., [], where Ec=m2ec3/(ehbar). The overcritical field polarizes the vacuum leading to an e+ e- pair plasma that loads baryons from the surroundings during its expansion. We calculate the dynamics of the self-acceleration of the pair-electromagnetic-baryon (PEMB) pulses to their point of transparency. We characterize the quantum vacuum polarization process in the sequences of decreasing time bins of the UPE by determining the radiation timescale, Lorentz factors, and transparency radius of the PEMB pulses. We also estimate the strength of the surrounding magnetic field 1014 G, and obtain a lower limit to the BH mass, M=2.4 Msun, and correspondingly an upper limit to the spin, alpha=0.6, from the conditions that the UPE is powered by the Kerr BH extractable energy and its mass is bound from below by the NS critical mass.

title: The GW-Universe Toolbox III: simulating joint observations of gravitational waves and gamma-ray bursts
authors: Kai Hendriks, Shu-Xu Yi, Gijs Nelemans
topic: In the current multi-messenger astronomy era, it is important that information about joint gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) observations through short gamma-ray burst (sGRBs) remains easily accessible. The possibility for non-experts to execute quick computations of joint GW-sGRB detections should be facilitated. We construct a sGRB model and add this to the framework of the previously-built Gravitational Wave Universe Toolbox. We provide expected joint GW-sGRB detection rates for different combinations of GW detectors and high-energy (HE) instruments. We employ and adapt a generic GRB model to create a top-hat jet model suitable for the Toolbox. We simulate a population of binary neutron stars (BNSs) observed by a user-specified GW detector. Our model predicts the properties of a resulting sGRB, as well as its detectability. We report predicted joint detection rates for combinations of GW detectors with HE instruments. Our findings stress the significance of the impact of the Einstein Telescope (ET); ET will observe BNSs at such a rate that the vast majority of detected sGRBs will have an observed GW counterpart. Additionally, given the limited LIGO horizon, a search for sub-threshold GW signals at higher redshifts using sGRB information from HE detectors has the potential to be very successful. Equivalently, during the ET era, GW data can assist in finding sub-threshold sGRBs, potentially increasing e.g. the number of joint ET-Fermi/GBM observations by 270%. Lastly, we find that our top-hat jet model underestimates the number of joint detections that include an off-axis sGRB. We correct for this with a second, wider and weaker jet component. We find that the majority of joint detections during the current era will include an off-axis sGRB, making GRB170817A not as unlikely as one would think. In the ET era, most joint detections will contain an on-axis sGRB.

title: Heavy elements and electromagnetic transients from neutron star mergers
authors: S. Rosswog, O. Korobkin
topic: Compact binary mergers involving neutron stars can eject a fraction of their mass to space. Being extremely neutron rich, this material undergoes rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis, and the resulting radioactivity powers fast, short-lived electromagnetic transients known as kilonova or macronova. Such transients are exciting probes of the most extreme physical conditions and their observation signals the enrichment of the Universe with heavy elements. Here we review our current understanding of the mass ejection mechanisms, the properties of the ejecta and the resulting radioactive transients. The first well-observed event in the aftermath of GW170817 delivered a wealth of insights, but much of today's picture of such events is still based on a patchwork of theoretical studies. Apart from summarizing the current understanding, we also point out questions where no consensus has been reached yet, and we sketch possible directions for the future research. In an appendix, we describe a publicly available heating rate library based on the WinNet nuclear reaction network, and we provide a simple fit formula to alleviate the implementation in hydrodynamic simulations.

title: Synchrotron Self-Compton Emission in the Two-Component Jet Model for Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Yuri Sato, Kaori Obayashi, B. Theodre Zhang, Shuta J. Tanaka, Kohta Murase, Yutaka Ohira, Ryo Yamazaki
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are intense bursts of high-energy photons (prompt emissions) caused by relativistic jets. After the emissions, multi-wavelength afterglows, from radio to very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays, last for more than a few days. In the past three years, the VHE gamma-ray photons from four GRBs (GRBs 180720B, 190114C, 190829A and 201216C) were detected by ground-based Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, such as the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). One of them, GRB 190829A, had some peculiar features of showing achromatic peaks in X-ray and optical bands at 1.4x103 s and being classified as low-luminosity GRBs. Previously, we proposed a two-component jet model, which has narrow jet with a small initial jet opening half-angle theta0(=0.015 rad) and large bulk Lorentz factor Gamma0=350 and wide jet with Theta0=0.1 rad and Gamma0=20. The narrow jet explained the early X-ray and optical emissions and apparently small isotropic gamma-ray energy and peak energy in the off-axis viewing case. Furthermore, the late X-ray and radio (1.3 and 15.5 GHz) afterglows were emitted from the wide jet. Here, we calculate the VHE gamma-ray flux by the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission. The multi-wavelength afterglows of GRB 190829A including the VHE gamma-ray emission are well explained by our two-component jet model. The afterglow emissions from our two-component jet are also consistent with the observational results of GRBs 180720B, 190114C and 201216C. Furthermore, we discuss the detectability of off-axis orphan afterglows by the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).

topic: We report on the follow-up of the extremely bright gamma-ray burst GRB 210619B with optical polarimetry. We conducted optopolarimetric observations of the optical afterglow of GRB 210619B in the SDSS-r band in the time window 5967 - 8245 seconds after the burst, using the RoboPol instrument at the Skinakas observatory. We find signs of variability of the polarization degree as well as the polarization angle during the time of observations. We also note a significant rise in polarization value and a significant change in the polarization angle towards the end of our observations. This is the first time such behavior is observed in this timescale.

title: Neutrino search from γ-ray bursts during the prompt and X-ray afterglow phases using 10 years of IceCube public data
authors: Francesco Lucarelli, Gor Oganesyan, Teresa Montaruli, Marica Branchesi, Alessio Mei, Samuele Ronchini, Francesco Brighenti, Biswajit Banerjee
topic: Neutrino emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been sought for a long time, and stringent limits on the most accredited GRB emission models have been obtained from IceCube. Multi-wavelength GRB observations of the last decades improved our knowledge of the GRB emission parameters, such as the Lorentz factor and the luminosity, which can vary from one GRB to another by several orders of magnitude. Empirical correlations among such parameters have been identified during the prompt phase, with direct implications on GRB models. In this work, we use the PSLab open-access code, developed for IceCube data analyses, to search for individual neutrino emission from the prompt and afterglow phases of selected GRBs, and for stacking emission from the ensemble of such GRBs. For the afterglow phase, we focus in particular on GRBs with X-ray flares and plateaus. While past stacking searches assumed the same GRB fluence at Earth, we present a stacking scheme based on physically motivated GRB weights. Moreover, we conceive a new methodology for the prompt phase that uses the empirical correlations to infer the GRB luminosity and Lorentz factor, when redshift measurements are not available. We do not observe any significant neutrino excess. Hence, we set constraints on the GRB neutrino fluxes and on relevant GRB parameters, including the magnetic field in the jet. Notably, the baryon loading is found to be <10 for typical GRB prompts, thus disfavoring a baryonic-dominated origin of the GRB ejecta.

title: Long-Term Simulations of Dynamical Ejecta: Homologous Expansion and Kilonova Properties
authors: Anna Neuweiler, Tim Dietrich, Mattia Bulla, Swami Vivekanandji Chaurasia, Stephan Rosswog, Maximiliano Ujevic
topic: Accurate numerical-relativity simulations are essential to study the rich phenomenology of binary neutron star systems. In this work, we focus on the material that is dynamically ejected during the merger process and on the kilonova transient it produces. Typically, radiative transfer simulations of kilonova light curves from ejecta make the assumption of homologous expansion, but this condition might not always be met at the end of usually very short numerical-relativity simulations. In this article, we adjust the infrastructure of the BAM code to enable longer simulations of the dynamical ejecta with the aim of investigating when the condition of homologous expansion is satisfied. In fact, we observe that the deviations from a perfect homologous expansion are about 30% at roughly 100ms after the merger. To determine how these deviations might affect the calculation of kilonova light curves, we extract the ejecta data for different reference times and use them as input for radiative transfer simulations. Our results show that the light curves for extraction times later than 80ms after the merger deviate by less than 0.4mag and are mostly consistent with numerical noise. Accordingly, deviations from the homologous expansion for the dynamical ejecta component are negligible for the purpose of kilonova modelling.

title: Early quark deconfinement in compact star astrophysics and heavy-ion collisions
authors: Oleksii Ivanytskyi, David Blaschke, Tobias Fischer, Andreas Bauswein
topic: Based on a recently developed relativistic density functional approach to color-superconducting quark matter and a novel quark-hadron transition construction which phenomenologically accounts for the effects of inhomogeneous pasta phases and quark-hadron continuity, we construct a class of hybrid equations of state applicable at the regimes typical for compact star astrophysics and heavy ion collisions. We outline that early quark deconfinement is a notable consequence of strong diquark pairing providing a good agreement with the observational data and driving the trajectories of the matter evolution during the supernovae explosions toward the regimes typical for the compact star mergers and heavy-ion collisions.

They are used to model the explosive disruption of a minimum-mass neutron star: a key ingredient of the stripping model for short gamma-ray bursts. The shock breakout from the neutron star surface accompanied by the acceleration of matter to ultrarelativistic velocities is studied. A comparison with the results of previously published nonrelativistic calculations is made.

title: High-order Discontinuous Galerkin hydrodynamics with sub-cell shock capturing on GPUs
authors: Miha Cernetic, Volker Springel, Thomas Guillet, Rüdiger Pakmor
topic: Hydrodynamical numerical methods that converge with high-order hold particular promise for astrophysical studies, as they can in principle reach prescribed accuracy goals with higher computational efficiency than standard second- or third-order approaches. Here we consider the performance and accuracy benefits of Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, which offer a particularly straightforward approach to reach extremely high order. Also, their computational stencil maps well to modern GPU devices, further raising the attractiveness of this approach. However, a traditional weakness of this method lies in the treatment of physical discontinuities such as shocks. We address this by invoking an artificial viscosity field to supply required dissipation where needed, and which can be augmented, if desired, with physical viscosity and thermal conductivity, yielding a high-order treatment of the Navier-Stokes equations for compressible fluids. We show that our approach results in sub-cell shock capturing ability, unlike traditional limiting schemes that tend to defeat the benefits of going to high order in DG in problems featuring many shocks. We demonstrate exponential convergence of our solver as a function of order when applied to smooth flows, such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz reference problem of arXiv:1509.03630. We also demonstrate excellent scalability of our GPU implementation up to hundreds of GPUs distributed on different compute nodes. In a first application to driven, sub-sonic turbulence, we highlight the accuracy advantages of high-order DG compared to traditional second-order accurate methods, and we stress the importance of physical viscosity for obtaining accurate velocity power spectra.

topic: This paper presents a study for the realization of a space mission which employs nanosatellites driven by an external laser source impinging on an optimized lightsail, as a valuable technology to launch swarms of spacecrafts into the Solar System. Nanosatellites propelled by laser can be useful for the heliosphere exploration and for planetary observation, if suitably equipped with sensors, or be adopted for the establishment of network systems when placed into specific orbits. By varying the area-to-mass ratio (i.e., the ratio between the sail area and the payload weight) and the laser power, it is possible to insert the spacecraft into different hyperbolic orbits with respect to Earth, thus reaching the target by means of controlled trajectories in a relatively short amount of time. A mission involving nanosatellites of the order of 1 kg of mass is envisioned, by describing all the on-board subsystems and satisfying all the requirements in term of power and mass budget. Particular attention is paid to the telecommunication subsystem, which must offer all the necessary functionalities. To fabricate the lightsail, the thin films technology has been considered, by verifying the sail thermal stability during the thrust phase. Moreover, the problem of mechanical stability of the lightsail has been tackled, showing that the distance between the ligthsail structure and the payload plays a pivotal role. Some potential applications of the proposed technology are discussed, such as the mapping of the heliospheric environment.

title: Pulsar Wind Nebulae
authors: A.M.W. Mitchell, J. Gelfand
topic: Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe), structures powered by energetic pulsars, are known for their detection across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with diverse morphologies and spectral behaviour between these bands. The temporal evolution of the morphology and spectrum of a PWN depends strongly on the properties of the associated neutron star, the relativistic outflow powered by its rotational energy, and surrounding medium, and thereby can vary markedly between objects. Due the continuous, but decreasing, injection of electrons and positrons into the PWN by the pulsar, the brightness and spectral variation within and amongst their wind nebulae reflect the magnetic field structure and particle transport within the PWN. This can include complex motions such as reverse flows or turbulence due to shock interactions and disruption to the nebula. During the last stage of the PWN's evolution, when the neutron star moves supersonically with respect to its environment, the escape of accelerated particles into the surrounding medium creates an extensive halo evident in very-high-energy gamma-rays. This chapter describes some of the identifying characteristics and key aspects of pulsar wind nebulae through their several evolutionary stages.

title: On the Potential of Faraday Tomography to Identify Shock Structures in Supernova Remnants
authors: Shinsuke Ideguchi, Tsuyoshi Inoue, Takuya Akahori, Keitaro Takahashi
topic: Knowledge about the magnetic fields in supernova remnants (SNRs) is of paramount importance for constraining Galactic cosmic ray acceleration models. It could also indirectly provide information on the interstellar magnetic fields. In this paper, we predict the Faraday dispersion functions (FDFs) of SNRs for the first time. For this study, we use the results of three dimensional (3D) ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of SNRs expanding into a weak, regular magnetic field. We present the intrinsic FDFs of the shocked region of SNRs for different viewing angles. We find that the FDFs are generally Faraday complex, which implies that conventional rotation measure study is not sufficient to obtain the information on the magnetic fields in the shocked region and Faraday tomography is necessary. We also show that the FDF allows to derive the physical-depth distribution of polarization intensity when the line of sight is parallel to the initial magnetic field orientation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the location of contact discontinuity can be identified from the radial profile of the width of the FDF with the accuracy of 0.1-0.2 pc.

title: Black hole hyperaccretion in collapsars. III. GRB timescale
authors: Yun-Feng Wei, Tong Liu
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are classified into long and short populations (i.e., LGRBs and SGRBs) based on the observed bimodal distribution of duration T90. Multimessenger observations indicated that most SGRBs and LGRBs should be powered by ultrarelativistic jets launched from black hole (BH) hyperaccretion in compact object mergers and massive collapsars, respectively. However, the duration criterion sometimes cannot correctly reflect the physical origin of a particular GRB. In the collapsar scenario, a GRB can be observed when the jet breaks out from the envelope and circumstellar medium successfully. The observed GRB duration reflects only the time that the engine operates after the jet breaks out. This work studies the propagation of jets driven by the neutrino annihilation or Blandford-Znajek mechanism in massive collapsars. The signatures of the progenitors for producing LGRBs, SGRBs, and failed GRBs in the collapsar scenario are exhibited. The competition between the mass supply onto the BH hyperaccretion and jet propagation into the envelope are definitely dependent on the density profiles of the collapsars. We show that duration and isotropic energy Egamma,iso of GRBs can help constrain the density profiles of collapsars. Finally, we propose that a collapsar-origin SGRB, GRB 200826A, might originate from a neutrino-annihilation-dominated jet launched by a 10 Ms collapsar whose progenitor's envelope has been stripped.

title: Synchrotron Polarization of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow Shocks with Hydrodynamic-scale Turbulent Magnetic Field
authors: Asuka Kuwata, Kenji Toma, Shigeo S. Kimura, Sara Tomita, Jiro Shimoda
topic: Afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are emitted from expanding forward shocks, which are expected to have magnetic field much stronger than the interstellar field, although the origin of the field is a long-standing problem. Two field amplification mechanisms, plasma kinetic instabilities and magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, have been discussed so far. The coherence length scales of the fields amplified by these two processes are different by 7-10 orders of magnitudes, and the polarimetric observations may distinguish them. We construct a semi-analytic model of the forward shock afterglow polarization under the assumption of hydrodynamic-scale turbulent magnetic field. We perform numerical calculations of synchrotron polarization for the isotropic turbulence and the zero viewing angle. We find that the polarization degrees are 1-3% when the field coherence length scale in the fluid comoving frame is comparable to the thickness of the shocked regions. This range of polarization degree is comparable to that of the observed late-phase optical afterglows. Our model also shows that the radio polarization degrees are comparable to the optical ones on average but can be higher than the optical ones at some time intervals. The polarization angles are shown to vary randomly and continuously. These polarimetric properties are clearly different from the case of plasma kinetic instability. Simultaneous polarimetric observations of GRB afterglows at the radio and optical bands have recently started, which will help us constrain the magnetic field amplification mechanism.

title: The late afterglow of GW170817/GRB170817A: a large viewing angle and the shift of the Hubble constant to a value more consistent with the local measurements
authors: Yi-Ying Wang, Shao-Peng Tang, Zhi-Ping Jin, Yi-Zhong Fan
topic: The multi-messenger data of neutron star merger events are promising for constraining the Hubble constant. So far, GW170817 is still the unique gravitational wave event with multi-wavelength electromagnetic counterparts. In particular, its radio and X-ray emission have been measured in the past 3-5 years. In this work, we fit the X-ray, optical, and radio afterglow emission of GW170817/GRB 170817A and find out that a relatively large viewing angle 0.5rad is needed; otherwise, the late time afterglow data can not be well reproduced. Such a viewing angle has been taken as a prior in the gravitational wave data analysis, and the degeneracy between the viewing angle and the luminosity distance is broken. Finally, we have a Hubble constant H0=72.00+4.05-4.13kms-1Mpc-1, which is more consistent with that obtained by other local measurements. If rather similar values are inferred from multi-messenger data of future neutron star merger events, it will provide critical support to the existence of the Hubble tension.

title: The Early Evolution of Magnetar Rotation I: Slowly Rotating "Normal" Magnetars
authors: Tejas Prasanna, Matthew S. B. Coleman, Matthias J. Raives, Todd A. Thompson
topic: In the seconds following their formation in core-collapse supernovae, "proto"-magnetars drive neutrino-heated magneto-centrifugal winds. Using a suite of two-dimensional axisymmetric MHD simulations, we show that relatively slowly rotating magnetars with initial spin periods of [] ms spin down rapidly during the neutrino Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling epoch. These initial spin periods are representative of those inferred for normal Galactic pulsars, and much slower than those invoked for gamma-ray bursts and super-luminous supernovae. Since the flow is non-relativistic at early times, and because the Alfvén radius is much larger than the proto-magnetar radius, spindown is millions of times more efficient than the typically-used dipole formula. Quasi-periodic plasmoid ejections from the closed zone enhance spindown. For polar magnetic field strengths B0≳5×1014 G, the spindown timescale can be shorter than than the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale. For B0 larger 1015 G, it is of order seconds in early phases. We compute the spin evolution for cooling proto-magnetars as a function of B0, P0, and mass (M). Proto-magnetars born with B0 greater than [] spin down to periods 1 s in just the first few seconds of evolution, well before the end of the cooling epoch and the onset of classic dipole spindown. Spindown is more efficient for lower M and for larger P0. We discuss the implications for observed magnetars, including the discrepancy between their characteristic ages and supernova remnant ages. Finally, we speculate on the origin of 1E 161348-5055 in the remnant RCW 103, and the potential for other ultra-slowly rotating magnetars.

topic: We present optical, radio and X-ray observations of a rapidly-evolving transient AT2019wxt (PS19hgw), discovered during the search for an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the gravitational-wave (GW) trigger S191213g (LIGO Scientific Collaboration & Virgo Collaboration 2019a). Although S191213g was not confirmed as a significant GW event in the off-line analysis of LIGO-Virgo data, AT2019wxt remained an interesting transient due its peculiar nature. The optical/NIR light curve of AT2019wxt displayed a double-peaked structure evolving rapidly in a manner analogous to currently know ultra-stripped supernovae (USSNe) candidates. This double-peaked structure suggests presence of an extended envelope around the progenitor, best modelled with two-components: i) early-time shock-cooling emission and ii) late-time radioactive 56Ni decay. We constrain the ejecta mass of AT2019wxt at Mej=0.20Ms which indicates a significantly stripped progenitor that was possibly in a binary system. We also followed-up AT2019wxt with long-term Chandra and Jansky Very Large Array observations spanning 260 days. We detected no definitive counterparts at the location of AT2019wxt in these long-term X-ray and radio observational campaigns. We establish the X-ray upper limit at 9.93x10-17 erg cm-2 s-1 and detect an excess radio emission from the region of AT2019wxt. However, there is little evidence for SN1993J- or GW170817-like variability of the radio flux over the course of our observations. A substantial host galaxy contribution to the measured radio flux is likely. The discovery and early-time peak capture of AT2019wxt in optical/NIR observation during EMGW follow-up observations highlights the need of dedicated early, multi-band photometric observations to identify USSNe.

authors: I. Agudo, L. Amati, T. An, F. E. Bauer, S. Benetti, et al
topic: We present the results from multi-wavelength observations of a transient discovered during the follow-up of S191213g, a gravitational wave (GW) event reported by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration as a possible binary neutron star merger in a low latency search. This search yielded SN2019wxt, a young transient in a galaxy whose sky position (in the 80\% GW contour) and distance (150\,Mpc) were plausibly compatible with the localisation uncertainty of the GW event. Initially, the transient's tightly constrained age, its relatively faint peak magnitude (Mi-16.7\,mag) and the r-band decline rate of 1\,mag per 5\,days appeared suggestive of a compact binary merger. However, SN2019wxt spectroscopically resembled a type Ib supernova, and analysis of the optical-near-infrared evolution rapidly led to the conclusion that while it could not be associated with S191213g, it nevertheless represented an extreme outcome of stellar evolution. By modelling the light curve, we estimated an ejecta mass of 0.1Msun, with 56Ni comprising 20\% of this. We were broadly able to reproduce its spectral evolution with a composition dominated by helium and oxygen, with trace amounts of calcium. We considered various progenitors that could give rise to the observed properties of SN2019wxt, and concluded that an ultra-stripped origin in a binary system is the most likely explanation. Disentangling electromagnetic counterparts to GW events from transients such as SN2019wxt is challenging: in a bid to characterise the level of contamination, we estimated the rate of events with properties comparable to those of SN2019wxt and found that 1 such event per week can occur within the typical GW localisation area of O4 alerts out to a luminosity distance of 500\,Mpc, beyond which it would become fainter than the typical depth of current electromagnetic follow-up campaigns.

title: The Influence of Beta Decay Rates on r-Process Observables
authors: Kelsey A. Lund, J. Engel, G.C. McLaughlin, M.R. Mumpower, E.M. Ney, R. Surman
topic: The rapid neutron capture process (r-process) is one of the main mechanisms whereby elements heavier than iron are synthesized, and is entirely responsible for the natural production of the actinides. Kilonova emissions are modeled as being largely powered by the radioactive decay of species synthesized via the r -process. Given that the r -process occurs far from nuclear stability, unmeasured beta decay rates play an essential role in setting the time scale for the r -process. In an effort to better understand the sensitivity of kilonova modeling to different theoretical global beta-decay descriptions, we incorporate these into nucleosynthesis calculations. We compare the results of these calculations and highlight differences in kilonova nuclear energy generation and light curve predictions, as well as final abundances and their implications for nuclear cosmochronometry. We investigate scenarios where differences in beta decay rates are responsible for increased nuclear heating on time scales of days that propagates into a significantly increased average bolometric luminosity between 1-10 days post-merger. We identify key nuclei, both measured and unmeasured, whose decay rates are directly impact nuclear heating generation on timescales responsible for light curve evolution. We also find that uncertainties in beta decay rates significantly impact ages estimates from cosmochronometry.

title: Probing particle acceleration at trans-relativistic shocks with off-axis gamma-ray burst afterglows
authors: Kazuya Takahashi, Kunihito Ioka, Yutaka Ohira, Hendrik J. van Eerten
topic: Particle acceleration is expected to be different between relativistic and non-relativistic collisionless shocks. We show that electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves (GWs), gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, are ideal targets for observing trans-relativistic evolution of accelerated electron distribution because the GWs spot nearby GRBs with off-axis jets, otherwise missed in gamma-ray observations. We find that the relativistic spectral slope begins to change steeply near the peak time of the light curve and approaches the non-relativistic limit in about 10 times the peak time. The trans-relativistic evolution of the afterglow synchrotron spectrum is consistent with GRB 170817A observations within errors, and will be measurable in similar but more distant events at a GW horizon 200 Mpc in a denser environment. We roughly estimate that such events represent a fraction of 10-50 per cent of the GRB 170817A-like off-axis short GRBs. We also find that the spectral evolution does not depend on the jet structure if their light curves are similar to each other.

title: Synchro-curvature emitting regions in high-energy pulsar models
authors: Daniel Íñiguez-Pascual, Daniele Viganò, Diego F. Torres
topic: The detected high-energy pulsars' population is growing in number, and thus, having agile and physically relevant codes to analyze it consistently is important. Here, we update our existing synchro-curvature radiation model by including a better treatment of the particle injection, particularly where the large pitch angle particles dominate the spectra, and by implementing a fast and accurate minimization technique. The latter allows a large improvement in computational cost, needed to test model enhancements and to apply the model to a larger pulsar population. We successfully fit the sample of pulsars with X-ray and γ-ray data. Our results indicate that, for every emitting particle, the spatial extent of their trajectory where the pitch angle is large and most of the detected X-ray radiation is produced is a small fraction of the light cylinder. We also confirm with this new approach that synchrotron radiation is not negligible for most of the gamma-ray pulsars detected. In addition, with the results obtained, we argue that J0357+3205 and J2055+2539 are MeV-pulsar candidates and are suggested for exhaustive observations in this energy band.

title: Magnetic field effects on nucleosynthesis and kilonovae from neutron star merger remnants
authors: 
topic: We investigate the influence of parametric magnetic field configurations of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) on electromagnetic (EM) observables, specifically the kilonova lightcurves and nucleosynthesis yields. We perform three-dimensional (3D) dynamical-spacetime general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, including a neutrino leakage scheme, microphysical finite-temperature equation of state (EOS), and an initial poloidal magnetic field. We find that varying the magnetic field strength and falloff impacts the formation of magnetized winds or mildy-relativistic jets, which in turn has profound effects on the outflow properties. All of the evolved configurations collapse to a black hole (BH) 21-23 ms after the onset of the simulations, however, the ones forming jets may be considerably more effective at transporting angular momentum out of the system, resulting in earlier collapse times. Larger mass ejecta rates and radial velocities of unbound material characterise the systems that form jets. The bolometric light curves of the kilonovae and r-process yields change considerably with different magnetic field parameters. We conclude that the magnetic field strength and falloff have robust effects on the outflow properties and electromagnetic observables. This can be particularly important as the total ejecta mass from our simulations (10-3Msun) makes the ejecta from HMNS a compelling source to power kilonova through radioactive decay of r-process elements.

title: Time-resolved polarizations of gamma-ray burst prompt emission with observed energy spectra
authors: Rui-Rui Wu, Qing-Wen Tang, Mi-Xiang Lan
topic: Time-resolved polarizations carry more physical information about the source of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) than the time-integrated ones. Therefore, they give more strict constrains on the models of GRB prompt phase. Both time-resolved and time-integrated polarizations are considered here. The model we use is the synchrotron emission in a large-scale ordered aligned magnetic field. Time-resolved polarizations of GRB prompt phase are derived with the corresponding time-resolved energy spectra. We found the time-integrated PDs calculated with two methods are similar. So it is convenient to estimate the time-integrated PD by the time-integrated energy spectrum. Most of the time-resolved PDs calculated in this paper will increase with time. The trend could match the observed time-resolved PD curve of GRB 170114A, but contrary to the predictions of a decaying PD of both the magnetized internal shock and magnetic reconnection models. PAs calculated in this paper, in general, are roughly constants with time. The predicted PAs here can not match with the violent PA changes observed in GRB 100826A and GRB 170114A. Therefore, more accurate time-resolved polarization observations are needed to test models and to diagnose the true physical process of GRB prompt phase.

title: Late-time accretion in neutron star mergers: implications for short gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae
authors: Wenbin Lu (UC Berkeley, Princeton), Eliot Quataert (Princeton)
topic: We study the long-term (t above 10 s) evolution of the accretion disk after a neutron star(NS)-NS or NS-black hole merger, taking into account the radioactive heating by r-process nuclei formed in the first few seconds. We find that the cumulative heating eventually exceeds the disk's binding energy at t 10to2 s [] after the merger, where alpha is the Shakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter and M is the mass of the remnant object. This causes the disk to evaporate rapidly and the jet power to shut off. We propose that this is the cause of the steep flux decline at the end of the extended emission (EE) or X-ray plateau seen in many short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The shallow flux evolution before the steep decline is consistent with a plausible scenario where the jet power scales linearly with the disk mass. We suggest that the jets from NS mergers have two components -- a short-duration narrow one corresponding to the prompt gamma-ray emission and a long-lasting wide component producing the EE. This leads to a prediction that "orphan EE" (without the prompt gamma-rays) may be a promising electromagnetic counterpart for NS mergers observable by future wide-field X-ray surveys. The long-lived disk produces a slow ejecta component that can efficiently thermalize the energy carried by beta-decay electrons up to t 100 d and contributes 10% of the kilonova's bolometric luminosity at these late epochs. We predict that future ground-based and JWST near-IR spectroscopy of nearby ( 100 Mpc) NS mergers will detect narrow (0.01c) line features a few weeks after the merger, which provides a powerful probe of the atomic species formed in these events.

title: General relativistic moving-mesh hydrodynamics simulations with AREPO and applications to neutron star mergers
authors: Georgios Lioutas, Andreas Bauswein, Theodoros Soultanis, Rüdiger Pakmor, Volker Springel, Friedrich K. Röpke
topic: We implement general relativistic hydrodynamics in the moving-mesh code AREPO. We also couple a solver for the Einstein field equations employing the conformal flatness approximation. The implementation is validated by evolving isolated static neutron stars using a fixed metric or a dynamical spacetime. In both tests the frequencies of the radial oscillation mode match those of independent calculations. We run the first moving-mesh simulation of a neutron star merger. The simulation includes a scheme to adaptively refine or derefine cells and thereby adjusting the local resolution dynamically. The general dynamics are in agreement with independent smoothed particle hydrodynamics and static-mesh simulations of neutron star mergers. Coarsely comparing, we find that dynamical features like the post-merger double-core structure or the quasi-radial oscillation mode persist on longer time scales, likely reflecting a lower numerical diffusivity of our method. Similarly, the post-merger gravitational wave emission shows the same features as observed in simulations with other codes. In particular, the main frequency of the post-merger phase is found to be in good agreement with independent results for the same binary system, while, in comparison, the amplitude of the post-merger gravitational wave signal falls off slower, i.e. the post-merger oscillations are less damped. The successful implementation of general relativistic hydrodynamics in the moving-mesh AREPO code, including a dynamical spacetime evolution, provides a fundamentally new tool to simulate general relativistic problems in astrophysics.

title: Core-collapse supernovae in dense environments -- particle acceleration and non-thermal emission
authors: Robert Brose, Iurii Sushch, Jonathan Mackey
topic: Supernova remnants are known to accelerate cosmic-rays from the detection of non-thermal emission in radio waves, X-rays, and gamma-rays. However, the ability to accelerate cosmic-rays up to PeV energies has yet to be demonstrated. The presence of cut-offs in the gamma-ray spectra of several young SNRs led to the idea that PeV energies might only be achieved during the first years of a remnant's evolution. We use our time-dependent acceleration-code RATPaC to study the acceleration of cosmic-rays in supernovae expanding into dense environments around massive stars. We performed spherically symmetric 1-D simulations in which we simultaneously solve the transport equations for cosmic-rays, magnetic turbulence, and the hydrodynamical flow of the thermal plasma in the test-particle limit. We investigated typical CSM parameters expected around RSG and LBV stars for freely expanding winds and accounted for the strong gamma-gamma-absorption in the first days after explosion. The maximum achievable particle energy is limited to below 600TeV even for largest considered values of the magnetic field and mass-loss rates. The maximum energy is not expected to surpass 200TeV and 70TeV for LBVs and RSGs that experience moderate mass-loss prior to the explosion. We find gamma-ray peak-luminosities consistent with current upper limits and evaluated that current-generation instruments are able to detect the gamma-rays from Type-IIP explosions at distances up to 60kpc and Type-IIn explosions up to 1.0Mpc. We also find a good agreement between the thermal X-ray and radio synchrotron emission predicted by our models with a range of observations.

title: Interpreting time-integrated polarization data of gamma-ray burst prompt emission
authors: R.Y. Guan, M.X. Lan
topic: Aims. With the accumulation of polarization data in the gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt phase, polarization models can be tested. Methods. We predicted the time-integrated polarizations of 30 GRBs with polarization observation. We used their observed spectral parameters to do this. In the model, the emission mechanism is synchrotron radiation, and the magnetic field configuration in the emission region was assumed to be large-scale ordered. Therefore, the predicted polarization degrees (PDs) are upper limits. Results. For most GRBs detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Polarimeter (GAP) and POLAR, the predicted PD can match the corresponding observed PD. Hence the synchrotron-emission model in a large-scale ordered magnetic field interprets the moderately low PDs detected by POLAR well. Therefore, the magnetic fields in these GRB prompt phases or at least during the peak times are dominated by the ordered component. While for AstroSat it has observed generally high PDs, and except for the observed PD upper limits, the predicted PDs in an ordered magnetic field (30%) are all lower than the observed values. Because the synchrotron emission in an ordered magnetic field predicts the upper limit of the PD for the synchrotron-emission models, the typical PD value detected by AstroSat challenges the synchrotron-emission models for polarization. Then we predict the PDs of the High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) and Low-energy Polarimetry Detector (LPD) on board the upcoming POLAR-2. In the synchrotron-emission models, the concentrated PD values of the GRBs detected by HPD will be higher than the LPD, which might be different from the predictions of the dissipative photosphere model. Therefore, more accurate multiband polarization observations are highly desired to test models of the GRB prompt phase.

title: Relativistic Effects and GRB Polarization in Power-Law Evolution
authors: Liang Li, She-Sheng Xue, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: Despite decades of polarization observations and high-significance polarized gamma-ray, X-ray, optical, and radio emissions in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been accumulating in dozens of cases, people have yet to find a consistent scenario for understanding the globally observed timing properties of GRB polarization to date. Here, we report that the observed properties of GRB polarization exhibit a four-segment timing evolution at the cosmological distance: (I) an initial hump early on (within the first few seconds); (II) a later on power-law decay (from 101 to 104 s), which takes the form of []; (III) afterwards a late-time rebrightening hump (from 104 to 105 s); and (IV) finally a flatting power-law decay (from 105 to 107 s), with the the form of []. These findings may present a challenge to the mainstream of polarization models that assume the polarization time evolution change in different emission regions. We show that these results can be explained by relativistic and geometric effects of a highly relativistic and magnetized jet generated by the central engine, and "magnetic patches" distributed as a globally random but locally coherent form. Our analysis suggests that there is a single dominant mechanism that might account for the global observational properties of GRB polarization, and other emission mechanisms and effects might play a role in spatially local and temporally short effects on GRB polarization.

title: Gravitational lensing in the presence of plasma scintillation with application to Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Pawan Kumar, Paz Beniamini
topic: We describe how gravitational lensing of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is affected by a plasma screen in the vicinity of the lens or somewhere between the source and the observer. Wave passage through a turbulent medium affects gravitational image magnification, lensing probability (particularly for strong magnification events), and the time delay between images. The magnification is suppressed because of the broadening of the angular size of the source due to scattering by the plasma. The time delay between images is modified as the result of different dispersion measure (DM) along photon trajectories for different images. Each of the image lightcurve is also broadened due to wave scattering so that the images could have distinct temporal profiles. The first two effects are most severe for stellar and sub-stellar mass lens, and the last one (scatter broadening) for lenses and plasma screens at cosmological distances from the source/observer. This could limit the use of FRBs to measure their cosmic abundance. On the other hand, when the time delay between images is large, such that the lightcurve of a transient source has two or more well separated peaks, the different DMs along the wave paths of different images can probe density fluctuations in the IGM on scales 10−6 rad and explore the patchy reionization history of the universe using lensed FRBs at high redshifts. Different rotation measure (RM) along two image paths can convert linearly polarized radiation from a source to partial circular polarization.

title: The first minutes of a binary-driven hypernova
authors: L. M. Becerra, R. Moradi, J. A. Rueda, R. Ruffini, Y. Wang
topic: We simulate the first minutes of the evolution of a binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) event, with a special focus on the associated accretion processes of supernova (SN) ejecta onto the newborn neutron star (NS) and the NS companion. We calculate the rotational evolution of the NS and the NS under the torques exerted by the accreted matter and the magnetic field. We take into account general relativistic effects and use realistic hypercritical accretion rates obtained from three-dimensional smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical simulations of the BdHN for a variety of orbital periods. We show that the rotation power of the NS has a unique double-peak structure while that of the NS has a single peak. These peaks are of comparable intensity and can occur very close in time or even simultaneously depending on the orbital period and the initial angular momentum of the stars. We outline the consequences of the above features in the early emission and their consequent observation in long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

title: Late-time post-merger modeling of a compact binary: effects of relativity, r-process heating, and treatment of transport effects
authors: Milad Haddadi, Matthew D. Duez, Francois Foucart, Teresita Ramirez, Rodrigo Fernandez, Alexander L. Knight, Jerred Jesse, Francois Hebert, Lawrence E. Kidder, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel
topic: Detectable electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves from compact binary mergers can be produced by outflows from the black hole-accretion disk remnant during the first ten seconds after the merger. Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations with effective viscosity remain an efficient and informative way to model this late-time post-merger evolution. In addition to the inherent approximations of axisymmetry and modeling turbulent angular momentum transport by a viscosity, previous simulations often make other simplifications related to the treatment of the equation of state and turbulent transport effects.
In this paper, we test the effect of these modeling choices. By evolving with the same viscosity the exact post-merger initial configuration previously evolved in Newtonian viscous hydrodynamics, we find that the Newtonian treatment provides a good estimate of the disk ejecta mass but underestimates the outflow velocity. We find that the inclusion of heavy nuclei causes a notable increase in ejecta mass. An approximate inclusion of r-process effects has a comparatively smaller effect, except for its designed effect on the composition. Diffusion of composition and entropy, modeling turbulent transport effects, has the overall effect of reducing ejecta mass and giving it a speed with lower average and more tightly-peaked distribution. Also, we find significant acceleration of outflow even at distances beyond 10,000\,km, so that thermal wind velocities only asymptote beyond this radius and at somewhat higher values than previously reported.

title: GRB 171205A: Hypernova and Newborn Neutron Star
authors: Yu Wang, L. M. Becerra, C. L. Fryer, J. A. Rueda, R. Ruffini
topic: GRB 171205A is a low-luminosity, long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) associated with SN 2017iuk, a broad-line type Ic supernova (SN). It is consistent with being formed in the core-collapse of a single CO star, or in a widely separated binary, which we have called the Binary driven Hypernova (BdHN) of type III. The core-collapse of the CO star forms a newborn NS (NS) and the SN explosion. Fallback accretion transfers mass and angular momentum to the νNS. The accretion energy injected into the expanding stellar layers powers the prompt emission. The multiwavelength power-law afterglow is explained by the synchrotron radiation of electrons in the SN ejecta, powered by energy injected by the spinning NS. We calculate the amount of mass and angular momentum gained by the NS, as well as the NS rotational evolution. The NS spins up to a period of 58 ms, then releases its rotational energy powering the synchrotron emission of the afterglow. The paucity of the NS spin explains the low-luminosity characteristic and that the optical emission of the SN from the nickel radioactive decay outshines the optical emission from the synchrotron radiation. From the NS evolution, we infer that the SN explosion had to occur at most 7.36 h before the GRB trigger. Therefore, for the first time, the analysis of the GRB data leads to the time of occurrence of the associated SN explosion, setting a stringent delay time between the neutrino emission associated with the SN and the electromagnetic emission of the GRB event.

title: Constraints on the very high energy gamma-ray emission from short GRBs with HAWC
authors: A. Albert, R. Alfaro, C. Alvarez, J.C. Arteaga-Velázquez, K.P. Arunbabu et al
topic: Many gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been observed from radio wavelengths, and a few at very-high energies (VHEs, 100GeV). The HAWC gamma-ray observatory is well suited to study transient phenomena at VHEs due to its large field of view and duty cycle. These features allow for searches of VHE emission and can probe different model assumptions of duration and spectra. In this paper, we use data collected by HAWC between December 2014 and May 2020 to search for emission in the energy range from 80 to 800 GeV coming from a sample 47 short GRBs that triggered the Fermi, Swift and Konus satellites during this period. This analysis is optimized to search for delayed and extended VHE emission within the first 20 s of each burst. We find no evidence of VHE emission, either simultaneous or delayed, with respect to the prompt emission. Upper limits (90\% confidence level) derived on the GRB fluence are used to constrain the synchrotron self-Compton forward-shock model. Constraints for the interstellar density as low as 10-2 cm-3 are obtained when assuming z=0.3 for bursts with the highest keV-fluences such as GRB 170206A and GRB 181222841. Such a low density makes observing VHE emission mainly from the fast cooling regime challenging.

title: Tidal-induced magnetar super flare at the eve of coalescence with its compact companion
authors: Zhen Zhang, Shu-Xu Yi, Shuang-Nan Zhang, Shao-Lin Xiong, Shuo Xiao
topic: In the late inspiral phase of a double neutron star (NS) or NS-back hole system in which one NS is a magnetar, the tidal force on the magnetar arisen from its companion will increase dramatically as the binary approaches. The tidal-induced deformation may surpass the maximum that the magnetar's crust can sustain at seconds or a fraction of a second before the coalescence. A catastrophic global crust destruction may thus occur, and the magnetic energy stored in the magnetar's interior will have the opportunity to be released which would be observed as a super flare with energy hundreds times larger than giant flares of magnetars. Such mechanism can naturally explain the recently observed precursor of GRB 211211A, including its quasi-periodic-oscillation. We predict that in the coming gravitational wave O4/O5 period, there could be a fraction of detected double NS mergers associated with such super flares. If observed, copious information on the structure and magnetic field in NS interior can be obtained, which is hard to study elsewhere.

title: Simulating the shock dynamics of a neutron star accretion column
authors: Pavel Abolmasov, Galina Lipunova
topic: Accretion onto a highly-magnetised neutron star runs through a magnetospheric flow, where the plasma follows the magnetic field lines in the force-free regime. The flow entering the magnetosphere is accelerated by the gravity of the star and then decelerated in a shock located above its surface. For a large mass accretion rate, most of the radiation comes from the radiation-pressure-dominated region below the shock, known as accretion column. Though the one-dimensional, stationary structure of this flow has been studied for many years, its global dynamics was hardly ever considered before. Considering the time-dependent structure of an accretion column allows us to test the stability of the existing stationary analytic solution, as well as its possible variability modes, and check the validity of its boundary conditions. Using a conservative scheme, we perform one-dimensional time-dependent simulations of an ideal radiative MHD flow inside an aligned dipolar magnetosphere. We assume that magnetic stresses dominate the momentum balance in general. However, along a given field line, the motion is essentially hydrodynamic, with gravity, centrifugal force, and radiation pressure acting as mass forces. When thermal pressure locally exceeds magnetic pressure, the flow is assumed to lose mass. Position of the shock agrees well with the theoretical predictions, though at higher luminosities, there is a limit set by advection effects: if more than 2/3 of the released power is advected with the flow, the analytic solution becomes self-inconsistent, and the column starts leaking at a finite height. Depending on the geometry, this breakdown may broaden the column, mass-load the field lines, and produce radiation-driven, mildly relativistic ejecta. Approaching the equilibrium position, the shock front experiences damped oscillations at a frequency close to the inverse sound propagation time.

title: Photons' scattering in a relativistic plasma with velocity shear: generation of high energy power-law spectra
authors: Mukesh K. Vyas, Asaf Pe'er
topic: A high energy power law is a common feature in the spectra of many astrophysical objects. We show that the photons in a relativistic plasma with a variable Lorentz factor go through repeated scattering with electrons to gain energy. The escaped population of photons naturally produces a power-law-shaped spectrum making it an anisotropic analogue to the conventional Fermi acceleration mechanism of charged particles. Thus, this mechanism provides a natural alternative to current explanations of high energy power-law spectra via synchrotron or thermal Comptonization. The model is applicable to any relativistic plasma beam with an arbitrary Lorentz factor profile. We implement the theory to GRB prompt phase and show that the obtained range of the photon indices is compatible with the observed values. Therefore, the observed high energy spectral indices provide a unique indicator of the jet structure.

title: A wind environment and Lorentz factors of tens explain gamma-ray bursts X-ray plateau
authors: H. Dereli-Bégué, A. Pe'er, F. Ryde, S.-R. Oates, B. Zhang, M.-G. Dainotti
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are known to have the most relativistic jets, with initial Lorentz factors in the order of a few hundreds. Many GRBs display an early X-ray light-curve plateau, which was not theoretically expected and therefore puzzled the community for many years. Here, we show that this observed signal is naturally obtained within the classical GRB "fireball" model, provided that the initial Lorentz factor is rather a few tens, and the expansion occurs into a medium-low density wind. The range of Lorentz factors in GRB jets is thus much wider than previously thought and bridges an observational gap between mildly relativistic jets inferred in active galactic nuclei, to highly relativistic jets deduced in few extreme GRBs. Furthermore, long GRB progenitors are either not Wolf-Rayet stars, or the wind properties during the final stellar evolution phase are different than at earlier times. We discuss several testable predictions of this model.

title: The Fast Flavor Instability in Hypermassive Neutron Star Disk Outflows
authors: Rodrigo Fernández, Sherwood Richers, Nicole Mulyk, Steven Fahlman
topic: We examine the effect of neutrino flavor transformation by the fast flavor instability (FFI) on long-term mass ejection from accretion disks formed after neutron star mergers. Neutrino emission and absorption in the disk set the composition of the disk ejecta, which subsequently undergoes r-process nucleosynthesis upon expansion and cooling. Here we perform 28 time-dependent, axisymmetric, viscous-hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks around hypermassive neutron stars (HMNSs) of variable lifetime, using a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme for emission and an annular-lightbulb scheme for absorption. We include neutrino flavor transformation due the FFI in a parametric way, by modifying the absorbed neutrino fluxes and temperatures, allowing for flavor mixing at various levels of flavor equilibration, and also in a way that aims to respect the lepton-number preserving symmetry of the neutrino self-interaction Hamiltonian. We find that for a promptly-formed black hole (BH), the FFI lowers the average electron fraction of the disk outflow due to a decrease in neutrino absorption, driven primarily by a drop in electron neutrino/antineutrino flux upon flavor mixing. For a long-lived HMNS, the disk emits more heavy lepton neutrinos and reabsorbs more electron neutrinos than for a BH, with a smaller drop in flux compensated by a higher neutrino temperature upon flavor mixing. The resulting outflow has a broader electron fraction distribution, a more proton-rich peak, and undergoes stronger radiative driving. Disks with intermediate HMNS lifetimes show results that fall in between these two limits. In most cases, the impact of the FFI on the outflow is moderate, with changes in mass ejection, average velocity, and average electron fraction of order 10%, and changes in the lanthanide/actinide mass fraction of up to a factor 2.

title: Massive black hole binaries in LISA: multimessenger prospects and electromagnetic counterparts
authors: A. Mangiagli, C. Caprini, M. Volonteri, S. Marsat, S. Vergani, N. Tamanini, H. Inchauspé
topic: In the next decade, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect the coalescence of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) in the range [104,108]Msun, up to z10. Their gravitational wave (GW) signal is expected to be accompanied by an electromagnetic counterpart (EMcp), generated by the gas accreting on the binary or on the remnant BH. In this work, we present the number and characteristics (such as redshift and mass distribution, apparent magnitudes or fluxes) of EMcps detectable jointly by LISA and some representative EM telescopes. We combine state-of-the-art astrophysical models for the galaxies formation and evolution to build the MBHBs catalogues, with Bayesian tools to estimate the binary sky position uncertainty from the GW signal. Exploiting additional information from the astrophysical models, such as the amount of accreted gas and the BH spins, we evaluate the expected EM emission in the soft X-ray, optical and radio bands. Overall, we predict between 7 and 21 EMcps in 4 yrs of joint observations by LISA and the considered EM facilities, depending on the astrophysical model. We also explore the impact of the hydrogen and dust obscuration of the optical and X-ray emissions, as well as of the collimation of the radio emission: these effects reduce the number to EMcps to 2 or 3, depending on the astrophysical model, again in 4 yrs of observations. Most of the EMcps are characterised by faint EM emission, challenging the observational capabilities of future telescopes. Finally, we also find that systems with multi-modal sky position posterior distributions represent only a minority of cases and do not affect significantly the number of EMcps.

title: Long-duration Gamma-ray Burst and Associated Kilonova Emission from Fast-spinning Black Hole--Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Jin-Ping Zhu, Xiangyu Ivy Wang, Hui Sun, Yuan-Pei Yang, Zhuo Li, Rui-Chong Hu, Ying Qin, Shichao Wu
topic: Here we collect three unique bursts, GRBs\,060614, 211211A and 211227A, all characterized by a long-duration main emission (ME) phase and a rebrightening extended emission (EE) phase, to study their observed properties and the potential origin as neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. NS-first-born (BH-first-born) NSBH mergers tend to contain fast-spinning (non-spinning) BHs that more easily (hardly) allow tidal disruption to happen with (without) forming electromagnetic signals. We find that NS-first-born NSBH mergers can well interpret the origins of these three GRBs, supported by that: (1) Their X-ray MEs and EEs show unambiguous fall-back accretion signatures, decreasing as t-5/3, which might account for their long duration. The EEs can result from the fall-back accretion of r-process heating materials, predicted to occur after NSBH mergers. (2) The beaming-corrected local event rate density for this type of merger-origin long-duration GRBs is [], consistent with that of NS-first-born NSBH mergers. (3) Our detailed analysis on the EE, afterglow and kilonova of the recently high-impact event GRB\,211211A reveals it could be a merger between a [] NS and a [] BH with an aligned-spin of χBH∼0.67+0.08−0.10, supporting an NS-first-born NSBH formation channel. Long-duration burst with rebrightening fall-back accretion signature after ME, and bright kilonova might be commonly observed features for on-axis NSBHs. We estimate the multimessenger detection rate between gravitational waves, GRBs and kilonovae from NSBH mergers in O4 (O5) is [].

title: Three-dimensional numerical simulations of structured GRB jets
authors: Gerardo Urrutia, Fabio De Colle, Diego López-Cámara
topic: After the detection of GRB 170817A, the first unambiguous off-axis gamma-ray burst (GRB), several studies tried to understand the structure of GRB jets. The initial jet structure (directly produced by the central engine) can be partially preserved, or can be completely modified by the interaction with the environment. In this study, we perform three-dimensional, special relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of long GRB jets evolving through a massive progenitor star. Different jet scenarios were considered: Top-hat, Gaussian jets dominated by pressure or by kinetic energy, as well as a model of a supernova (SN) plus a jet both propagating through the progenitor. We found that, while propagating inside the progenitor star, jets with different initial structures are nearly indistinguishable. Kinetic dominated jets are faster and more collimated than pressure dominated jets. The dynamics of jets inside the progenitor star strongly depends on the presence of an associated SN, which can strongly decelerate the jet propagation. We show that the initial structure of GRB jets is preserved, or not, mainly depending on the jet duration (tj) and on the jet break-out time (tbo) from the dense environment. The initial structure is preserved in long-lasting jets (tj \gr tbo), while the interaction with the medium shapes short duration jets (tj less tbo). Future observations of a large sample of off-axis GRB will constrain the density stratification of the environment, the initial structure of the jet, and the physics of the central engine itself.

title: A study of the agreement between binary neutron star ejecta models derived from numerical relativity simulations
authors: Amelia Henkel, Francois Foucart, Geert Raaijmakers, Samaya Nissanke
topic: Neutron star mergers have recently become a tool to study extreme gravity, nucleosynthesis, and the chemical composition of the Universe. To date, there has been one joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation of a binary neutron star merger, GW170817, as well as a solely gravitational observation, GW190425. In order to accurately identify and interpret electromagnetic signals of neutron star mergers, better models of the matter outflows generated by these mergers are required. We compare a series of ejecta models to see where they provide strong constraints on the amount of ejected mass expected from a system, and where systematic uncertainties in current models prevent us from reliably extracting information from observed events. We also examine 2396 neutron star equations of state compatible with GW170817 to see whether a given ejecta mass could be reasonably produced with a neutron star of said equation of state, and whether different ejecta models provide consistent predictions. We find that the difference between models is often comparable to or larger than the error generally assumed for these models, implying better constraints on the models are needed. We also note that the extrapolation of outflow models outside of their calibration window, while commonly needed to analyze gravitational wave events, is extremely unreliable and occasionally leads to completely unphysical results.

title: Extensive study of nuclear uncertainties and their impact on the r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers
authors: I. Kullmann, S. Goriely, O. Just, A. Bauswein, H.-T. Janka
topic: Theoretically predicted yields of elements created by the rapid neutron capture (r-) process carry potentially large uncertainties associated with incomplete knowledge of nuclear properties as well as approximative hydrodynamical modelling of the matter ejection processes. We present an in-depth study of the nuclear uncertainties by systematically varying theoretical nuclear input models that describe the experimentally unknown neutron-rich nuclei. This includes two frameworks for calculating the radiative neutron capture rates and six, four and four models for the nuclear masses, beta-decay rates and fission properties, respectively. Our r-process nuclear network calculations are based on detailed hydrodynamical simulations of dynamically ejected material from NS-NS or NS-BH binary mergers plus the secular ejecta from BH-torus systems. The impact of nuclear uncertainties on the r-process abundance distribution and early radioactive heating rate is found to be modest (within a factor 20 for individual A-90 nuclei and a factor 2 for the heating rate), however the impact on the late-time heating rate is more significant and depends strongly on the contribution from fission. We witness significantly larger sensitivity to the nuclear physics input if only a single trajectory is used compared to considering ensembles of 200-300 trajectories, and the quantitative effects of the nuclear uncertainties strongly depend on the adopted conditions for the individual trajectory. We use the predicted Th/U ratio to estimate the cosmochronometric age of six metal-poor stars to set a lower limit of the age of the Galaxy and find the impact of the nuclear uncertainties to be up to 2 Gyr.

Motivated by recent hydrodynamical simulations, we assume the debris streams promptly and rapidly circularize (on the orbital period of the most tightly bound debris), generating a hot quasi-spherical pressure-supported envelope of radius Rv - 1e14 cm (photosphere radius 1e15 cm) surrounding the supermassive black hole (SMBH). As the envelope cools radiatively, it undergoes Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction Rv - t^(-1), its temperature rising Teff - t^(1/2) while its total luminosity remains roughly constant; the optical luminosity decays as nu Lnu - Rv^2 Teff - t^(-3/2). Despite this similarity to the mass fall-back rate Mdot-fb - t^(-5/3), envelope heating from fall-back accretion is sub-dominant compared to the envelope cooling luminosity except near optical peak (where they are comparable). Envelope contraction can be delayed by energy injection from accretion from the inner envelope onto the SMBH in a regulated manner, leading to a late-time flattening of the optical/X-ray light curves, similar to those observed in some TDEs. Eventually, as the envelope contracts to near the circularization radius, the SMBH accretion rate rises to its maximum, in tandem with the decreasing optical luminosity. This cooling-induced (rather than circularization-induced) delay of up to several hundred days, may account for the delayed onset of thermal X-rays, late-time radio flares, and high-energy neutrino generation, observed in some TDEs. We compare the model predictions to recent TDE light curve correlation studies, finding agreement as well as points of tension.

title: Turbulent Magnetic Field Amplification by the Interaction of Shock Wave and Inhomogeneous Medium
authors: Yue Hu, Siyao Xu, James M. Stone, Alex Lazarian
topic: Magnetic fields on the order of 100 micG observed in young supernova remnants cannot be amplified by shock compression alone. To investigate the amplification caused by turbulent dynamo, we perform three-dimensional MHD simulations of the interaction between shock wave and inhomogeneous density distribution with a shallow spectrum in the preshock medium. The postshock turbulence is mainly driven by the strongest preshock density contrast and cascades to smaller scales. The resulting turbulence amplifies the postshock magnetic field. The magnetic fields' time evolution agrees with the prediction of the nonlinear dynamo theory in Xu & Lazarian (2016). When the initial weak magnetic field is perpendicular to shock normal, the total amplification of the field's strength achieves a factor of 200, which is twice larger than the one in the parallel shock case. However, the strongest magnetic field has a low volume filling factor and is limited by the turbulent energy due to the reconnection diffusion taking place in a turbulent and magnetized fluid. The magnetic field strength averaged along the shock surface is reduced by a factor 10. We decompose the turbulent velocity and magnetic field into solenoidal and compressive modes. The solenoidal mode is dominant and follows the Kolmogorov scaling, even though the preshock density distribution has a shallow spectrum. When the preshock density distribution has a Kolmogorov spectrum, the fraction of the compressive component increases. We find that the perpendicular shock exhibits a smaller turbulent Alfvén Mach number in the vicinity of the shock front than the parallel shock.

title: Long-term evolution of non-thermal emission from Type Ia and core-collapse supernova remnants in a diversified circumstellar medium
authors: Ryosuke Kobashi, Haruo Yasuda, Shiu-Hang Lee
topic: The contribution of galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) to the origin of cosmic rays (CRs) is an important open question in modern astrophysics. Broadband non-thermal emission is a useful proxy for probing the energy budget and production history of CRs in SNRs. We conduct hydrodynamic simulations to model the long-term SNR evolution from explosion all the way to the radiative phase (or 3x105 yrs at maximum), and compute the time evolution of the broadband non-thermal spectrum to explore its potential applications on constraining the surrounding environments as well as the natures and mass-loss histories of the SNR progenitors. A parametric survey is performed on the ambient environments separated into two main groups, namely a homogeneous medium with a uniform gas density and one with the presence of a circumstellar structure created by the stellar wind of a massive red-supergiant (RSG) progenitor star. Our results reveal a highly diverse evolution history of the non-thermal emission closely correlated to the environmental characteristics of a SNR. Up to the radiative phase, the roles of CR re-acceleration and ion-neutral wave damping on the spectral evolution are investigated. Finally, we make an assessment of the future prospect of SNR observations by the next-generation hard X-ray space observatory FORCE and predict what we can learn from their comparison with our evolution models.

title: Non-thermal emission from mildly relativistic dynamical ejecta of neutron star mergers
authors: Gilad Sadeh, Or Guttman, Eli Waxman
topic: Binary neutron star mergers are expected to produce fast dynamical ejecta, with mildly relativistic velocities extending to b=v/c  l 0.6. We consider the radio to X-ray synchrotron emission produced by collisionless shocks driven by such fast ejecta into the interstellar medium. Analytic expressions are given for spherical ejecta with broken power-law mass (or energy) distributions, M(>g b )prop(g b)-s with s=sKN at g b l g0b0 and s=sft at g b β l g0b0 (where γ is the Lorentz factor). For parameter values characteristic of merger calculation results -- a "shallow" mass distribution, 1 l sKN l 3, for the bulk of the ejecta (at g b =0.2), and a steep, sft g 5, "fast tail" mass distribution -- our model provides an accurate (to 10's of percent) description of the evolution of the flux, including at the phase of deceleration to sub-relativistic expansion. This is a significant improvement over earlier results, based on extrapolations of results valid for gb gg 1 or ll 1 to gb=1, which overestimate the flux by an order of magnitude for typical parameter values. It will enable a more reliable inference of ejecta parameters from future measurements of the non-thermal emission. For the merger event GW170817, the existence of a "fast tail" is expected to produce detectable radio and X-ray fluxes over a time scale of 104days.

authors: Yu Wang, J. A. Rueda, R. Ruffini, R. Moradi, Liang Li, Y. Aimuratov, F. Rastegarnia, S. Eslamzadeh, N. Sahakyan, Yunlong Zheng
topic: GRB 190829A is the fourth closest gamma-ray burst (GRB) to date (z=0.0785). Owing to its wide range of radio, optical, X-ray, and the very-high-energy (VHE) observations by H.E.S.S., it has become an essential new source examined by various models with complementary approaches. We here show in GRB 190829A the double-prompt pulses and the three-multiwavelength afterglows are consistent with the type II binary-driven hypernova (BdHN II) model. The progenitor is a binary composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The gravitational collapse of the iron core of the CO star produces a supernova (SN) explosion and leaves behind a new neutron star (nNS) at its center. The accretion of the SN ejecta onto the NS companion and onto the nNS via matter fallback spins up the NSs and produces the double-peak prompt emission. The synchrotron emission from the expanding SN ejecta with the energy injection from the rapidly spinning nNS and its subsequently spin-down leads to the afterglow in the radio, optical, and X-ray. We model the sequence of physical and related radiation processes in BdHNe and focus on individuating the binary properties that play the relevant roles.

title: Polarized Radiation Signals from Highly Magnetized Neutron Star Surfaces
authors: Kun Hu, Matthew G. Baring, Joseph A. Barchas, George Younes
topic: The surfaces of neutron stars are likely sources of strongly polarized soft X rays due to the presence of strong magnetic fields. Scattering transport in the surface layers is critical to the determination of the emergent anisotropy of light intensity, and is strongly influenced by the complicated interplay between linear and circular polarization information. We have developed a magnetic Thomson scattering simulation to model the outer layers of fully-ionized atmospheres in such compact objects. Here we summarize emergent intensities and polarizations from extended atmospheric simulations, spanning considerable ranges of magnetic colatitudes. General relativistic propagation of light from the surface to infinity is fully included. The net polarization degrees are moderate and not very small when summing over a variety of field directions. These results provide an important foundation for observations of magnetars to be acquired by NASA's new IXPE X-ray polarimeter and future X-ray polarimetry missions.

title: The emergence of diffused Gamma-Ray Burst afterglows from the disks of Active Galactic Nuclei
authors: Yihan Wang, Davide Lazzati, Rosalba Perna
topic: The disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) have emerged as rich environments for the production and capture of stars and the compact objects that they leave behind. These stars produce long Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) at their deaths, while frequent interactions among compact objects form binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole binaries, leading to short GRBs (SGRBs) upon their merger. Predicting the properties of these transients as they emerge from the dense environments of AGN disks is key to their proper identification and to better constrain the star and compact object population in AGN disks. Some of these transients would appear unusual because they take place in much higher densities than the interstellar medium. Others, which are the subject of this paper, would additionally be modified by radiation diffusion since they are generated within optically thick regions of the accretion disks. Here we compute the GRB afterglow light curves for diffused GRB sources for a representative variety of central black-hole masses and disk locations. We find that the radiation from radio to UV and soft X-rays can be strongly suppressed by synchrotron self-absorption in the dense medium of the AGN disk. In addition, photon diffusion can significantly delay the emergence of the emission peak, turning a beamed, fast transient into a slow, isotropic, and dimmer one. These would appear as broadband-correlated AGN variability with dominance at the higher frequencies. Their properties can constrain both the stellar populations within AGN disks as well as the disk structure.

title: A general, scale-independent description of the sound speed in neutron stars
authors: Christian Ecker, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: Using more than a million randomly generated equations of state that satisfy theoretical and observational constraints we construct a novel, scale-independent description of the sound speed in neutron stars where the latter is expressed in a unit-cube spanning the normalised radius, r/R, and the mass normalized to the maximum one, M/MTOV. From this generic representation, a number of interesting and surprising results can be deduced. In particular, we find that light (heavy) stars have stiff (soft) cores and soft (stiff) outer layers, respectively, or that the maximum of the sound speed is located at the center of light stars but moves to the outer layers for stars with M/MTOV larger 0.7, reaching a constant value of c2s=1/2 as M close MTOV. We also show that the sound speed decreases below the conformal limit c2s=1/3 at the center of stars with M=MTOV. Finally, we construct an analytic expression that accurately describes the radial dependence of the sound speed as a function of the neutron-star mass, thus providing an estimate of the maximum sound speed expected in a neutron star.

title: Thermodynamics of Hot Neutron Stars and Universal Relations
authors: P. Laskos-Patkos, P.S. Koliogiannis, A. Kanakis-Pegios, Ch.C. Moustakidis
topic: Over the last few years, the detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron star systems has rekindled our hopes for a deeper understanding of the unknown nature of ultra dense matter. In particular, gravitational wave constraints on the tidal deformability of a neutron star can be translated into constraints on several neutron star properties using a set of universal relations. Apart from binary neutron star mergers, supernova explosions are also important candidates for the detection of multimessenger signals. Such observations may allow us to impose significant constraints on the binding energy of neutron stars. The purpose of the present study is twofold. Firstly, we investigate the agreement of finite temperature equations of state with established universal relations. Secondly, we examine the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy and the dimensionless tidal deformability, which are the bulk properties connected to the most promising sources for multimessenger signals. We find that hot equations of state are not always compatible with accepted universal relations. Therefore, the use of such expressions for probing general relativity or imposing constraints on the structure of neutron stars would be inconclusive (when thermal effects are present). Additionally, we show that the binding energy and the dimensionless tidal deformability exhibit a universal trend at least for moderate neutron star masses. The latter allows us to set bounds on the binding energy of a 1.4 Msun neutron star using data from the GW170817 event. Finally, we provide a relation between the compactness, the binding energy and the dimensionless tidal deformability of a neutron star, that is not only independent on the employed equation of state but also holds when thermal effects are present.

title: Shock Breakout from Stellar Envelopes: The relativistic limit
authors: Tamar Faran, Re'em Sari
topic: We calculate the observed luminosity and spectrum following the emergence of a relativistic shock wave from a stellar edges. Shock waves propagating at 0.6 less Gamma sh beta sh, where Gamma sh is the shock Lorentz factor and beta sh is its associated reduced velocity, heat the stellar envelope to temperatures exceeding 50 keV, allowing for a vigorous production of electron and positron pairs. Pairs significantly increase the electron scattering optical depth and regulate the temperature through photon generation, producing distinct observational signatures in the escaping emission. Assuming Wien equilibrium, we find analytic expressions for the temperature and pair density profiles in the envelope immediately after shock passage, and compute the emission during the expansion phase. Our analysis shows that in pair loaded regions, photons are produced at a roughly uniform rest frame energy of 200 keV, and reinforces previous estimates that the shock breakout signal will be detected as a short burst of energetic gamma-ray photons, followed by a longer phase of X-ray emission. We test our model on a sample of low-luminosity gamma ray bursts using a closure relation between the gamma-ray burst duration, the radiation temperature and the gamma-ray isotropic equivalent energy, and find that some of the events are consistent with the relativistic shock breakout model. Finally, we apply our results to explosions in white dwarfs and neutron stars, and find that typical type Ia supernovae emit 1041 erg in the form of 1 MeV photons.

title: Neutrino Fast Flavor Instability in three dimensions for a Neutron Star Merger
authors: Evan Grohs, Sherwood Richers, Sean M. Couch, Francois Foucart, James P. Kneller, G. C. McLaughlin
topic: The flavor evolution of neutrinos in core collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers is a critically important unsolved problem in astrophysics. Following the electron flavor evolution of the neutrino system is essential for calculating the thermodynamics of compact objects as well as the chemical elements they produce. Accurately accounting for flavor transformation in these environments is challenging for a number of reasons, including the large number of neutrinos involved, the small spatial scale of the oscillation, and the nonlinearity of the system. We take a step in addressing these issues by presenting a method which describes the neutrino fields in terms of angular moments. Our moment method successfully describes the fast flavor neutrino transformation phenomenon which is expected to occur in regions close to the central object. We apply our moment method to neutron star merger conditions and show that we are able to capture the three phases of growth, saturation, and decoherence by comparing with particle-in-cell calculations. We also determine the size of the growing fluctuations in the neutrino field.

title: Tidal Deformability of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars
authors: Kwing-Lam Leung, Ming-Chung Chu, Lap-Ming Lin
topic: The tidal properties of a neutron star are measurable in the gravitational waves emitted from inspiraling binary neutron stars, and they have been used to constrain the neutron star equation of state. In the same spirit, we study the dimensionless tidal deformability of dark matter admixed neutron stars. The tidal Love number is computed in a two-fluid framework. The dimensionless tidal Love number and dimensionless tidal deformability are computed for dark matter admixed stars with the dark matter modelled as ideal Fermi gas or self-interactive bosons. The dimensionless tidal deformability shows a sharp change from being similar to that of a pure normal matter star to that of a pure dark matter star, within a narrow range of intermediate dark matter mass fraction. Based on this result, we illustrate an approach to study the dark matter parameters through the tidal properties of massive compact stars, making use of the self-similarity of the dimensionless tidal deformability-mass relations when the dark matter mass fraction is high.

authors: Z. S. Taghadomi, Y. Wan, A. Flowers, P. C. Stancil, B. M. McLaughlin, S. Bromley, J. P. Marler, C. E. Sosolik, S. Loch
topic: Direct detection of gravitational waves (GW) on Aug. 17, 2017, propagating from a binary neutron star merger, opened the era of multimessenger astronomy. The ejected material from neutron star mergers, or kilonova, is a good candidate for optical and near infrared follow-up observations after the detection of GWs. The kilonova from the ejecta of GW1780817 provided the first evidence for the astrophysical site of the synthesis of heavy nuclei through the rapid neutron capture process or rprocess. Since properties of the emission are largely affected by opacities of the ejected material, enhancements in the available, but limited rprocess atomic data have been motivated recently. However, given the complexity of the electronic structure of these heavy elements, considerable efforts are still needed to converge to a reliable set of atomic structure data. The aim of this work is to alleviate this situation for low charge state elements in the Os-like isoelectronic sequence. In this regard, the general purpose relativistic atomic structure packages (GRASP0 and GRASP2K) were used to obtain energy levels and transition probabilities (E1 and M1). We provide line lists and expansion opacities for a range of r-process elements. We focus here on the Os isoelectronic sequence (Os I, Ir II, Pt III, Au IV, Hg V). The results are benchmarked against existing experimental data and prior calculations, and predictions of emission spectra relevant to kilonovae are provided. Finestructure (M1) lines in the infrared potentially observable by the James Webb Space Telescope are highlighted.

title: A new formulation of strong-field magnetohydrodynamics for neutron stars
authors: Shreya Vardhan, Sašo Grozdanov, Samuel Leutheusser, Hong Liu
topic: We present a formulation of magnetohydrodynamics which can be used to describe the evolution of strong magnetic fields in neutron star interiors. Our approach is based on viewing magnetohydrodynamics as a theory with a one-form global symmetry and developing an effective field theory for the hydrodynamic modes associated with this symmetry. In the regime where the local velocity and temperature variations can be neglected, we derive the most general constitutive relation consistent with symmetry constraints for the electric field in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This constitutive relation not only reproduces the phenomena of Ohmic decay, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift derived in a phenomenological model by Goldreich and Reisenegger, but also reveals new terms in the evolution of the magnetic field which cannot easily be seen from such microscopic models. This formulation gives predictions for novel diffusion behaviors of small perturbations around a constant background magnetic field, and for the two-point correlation functions among various components of the electric and magnetic fields.

title: Equation of state in neutron stars and supernovae
authors: Kohsuke Sumiyoshi, Toru Kojo, Shun Furusawa
topic: Neutron stars and supernovae provide cosmic laboratories of highly compressed matter at supra nuclear saturation density which is beyond the reach of terrestrial experiments. The properties of dense matter is extracted by combining the knowledge of nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations via theoretical frameworks. A matter in neutron stars is neutron rich, and may further accommodate non-nucleonic degrees of freedom such as hyperons and quarks. The structure and composition of neutron stars are determined by equations of state of matter, which are the primary subject in this chapter. In case of supernovae, the time evolution includes several dynamical stages whose descriptions require equations of state at finite temperature and various lepton fractions. Equations of state also play essential roles in neutron star mergers which allow us to explore new conditions of matter not achievable in static neutron stars and supernovae. Several types of hadron-to-quark transitions, from first order transitions to crossover, are reviewed, and their characteristics are summarized.

authors: Elias R. Most, Alexander Haber, Steven P. Harris, Ziyuan Zhang, Mark G. Alford, Jorge Noronha
topic: In nuclear matter in neutron stars the flavor content (e.g., proton fraction) is subject to weak interactions, establishing flavor (beta-)equilibrium. During the merger of two neutron stars there can be deviations from this equilibrium. By incorporating Urca processes into general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, we study the resulting out-of-equilibrium dynamics during the collision. We provide the first direct evidence that microphysical transport effects at late times reach a hydrodynamic regime with a nonzero bulk viscosity, making neutron star collisions intrinsically viscous. Finally, we identify signatures of this process in the post-merger gravitational wave emission.

The stellar environment provides very high neutron flux in a short time ( seconds) which is conducive for the creation of progressively neutron-rich nuclei till the waiting point is reached after which no further neutron capture reactions proceed. At this point such extremely neutron-rich nuclei become stable via beta- decay. A detailed understanding of the r-process remains illusive. In the present work, we explore the radiative neutron-capture (n,gamma) cross sections and reaction rates around the r-process peak near mass number eighty. The inherent uncertainties remain large in some cases, particularly in case of neutron-rich nuclei. When the low-energy enhancement exists, it results in significant increase in the reaction rate for neutron-capture.

title: Finite-temperature effects in dynamical-spacetime binary neutron star merger simulations: Validation of the parametric approach
authors: Carolyn Raithel, Pedro Espino, Vasileios Paschalidis
topic: Parametric equations of state (EoSs) provide an important tool for systematically studying EoS effects in neutron star merger simulations. In this work, we perform a numerical validation of the M-framework for parametrically calculating finite-temperature EoS tables. The framework, introduced in Raithel et al. (2019), provides a model for generically extending any cold, beta-equilibrium EoS to finite-temperatures and arbitrary electron fractions. In this work, we perform numerical evolutions of a binary neutron star merger with the SFHo finite-temperature EoS, as well as with the M-approximation of this same EoS, where the approximation uses the zero-temperature, beta-equilibrium slice of SFHo and replaces the finite-temperature and composition-dependent parts with the M-model. We find that the approximate version of the EoS is able to accurately recreate the temperature and thermal pressure profiles of the binary neutron star remnant, when compared to the results found using the full version of SFHo. We additionally find that the merger dynamics and gravitational wave signals agree well between both cases, with differences of 1-2% introduced into the post-merger gravitational wave peak frequencies by the approximations of the EoS. We conclude the M-framework can be reliably used to probe neutron star merger properties in numerical simulations.

title: Quasi-perpendicular shock acceleration and TDE radio flares
authors: Siyao Xu
topic: Delayed radio flares of optical tidal disruption events (TDEs) indicate the existence of non-relativistic outflows accompanying TDEs. The interaction of TDE outflows with the surrounding circumnuclear medium creates quasi-perpendicular shocks in the presence of toroidal magnetic fields. Because of the large shock obliquity and large outflow velocity, we find that the shock acceleration induced by TDE outflows generally leads to a steep particle energy spectrum, with the power-law index significantly larger than the "universal" index for a parallel shock. The measured synchrotron spectral indices of recently detected TDE radio flares are consistent with our theoretical expectation. It suggests that the particle acceleration at quasi-perpendicular shocks can be the general acceleration mechanism accounting for the delayed radio emission of TDEs.

authors: Yvette Cendes, Edo Berger, Kate Alexander, Sebastian Gomez, Aprajita Hajela, Ryan Chornock, Tanmoy Laskar, Raffaella Margutti, Brian Metzger, Michael Bietenholz, Daniel Brethauer, Mark Wieringa
topic: We present late-time radio/millimeter (as well as optical/UV and X-ray) detections of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018hyz, spanning 970-1300 d after optical discovery. In conjunction with earlier deeper limits, including at 700 d, our observations reveal rapidly rising emission at 0.8-240 GHz, steeper than Fnu-t5 relative to the time of optical discovery. Such a steep rise cannot be explained in any reasonable scenario of an outflow launched at the time of disruption (e.g., off-axis jet, sudden increase in the ambient density), and instead points to a delayed launch. Our multi-frequency data allow us to directly determine the radius and energy of the radio-emitting outflow, showing that it was launched 750 d after optical discovery. The outflow velocity is mildly relativistic, with beta=0.25 and 0.6 for a spherical and a 10edg jet geometry, respectively, and the minimum kinetic energy is EK=5.8x1049 and 6.3x1049 erg, respectively. This is the first definitive evidence for the production of a delayed mildly-relativistic outflow in a TDE; a comparison to the recently-published radio light curve of ASASSN-15oi suggests that the final re-brightening observed in that event (at a single frequency and time) may be due to a similar outflow with a comparable velocity and energy. Finally, we note that the energy and velocity of the delayed outflow in AT2018hyz are intermediate between those of past non-relativistic TDEs (e.g., ASASSN-14li, AT2019dsg) and the relativistic TDE Sw\,J1644+57. We suggest that such delayed outflows may be common in TDEs.

title: Search for multi-messenger events during LIGO/Virgo era
authors: Tosta e Melo, I., LVK collaboration
topic: Multi-messenger astronomy is a vast and expanding field as electromagnetic observations (EM) are no longer the only way of exploring the Universe. Due to the new messengers, astrophysical events with both gravitational waves (GWs) and EM emission are no longer a dream of the astronomical community. A breakthrough for GW multi-messenger astronomy came when the LIGO-Virgo network detected a GW signal of two low-mass compact objects consistent with a binary neutron star (BNS, GW170817) an event that generated a short gamma-ray burst (GRBs) and a kilonova. While GW170817 represents the testimony to BNS mergers being the progenitor of at least some GRBs, a wide range of highly energetic astrophysical phenomena is expected to be accompanied by the emission of GWs and photons. Here we present an unmodelled method to search for GWs having gamma and radio counterparts, using the LIGO-Virgo data and observations of partner telescopes. We also discuss the most recent results of the unmodelled coherent searches targeting astrophysical events during the first part of the LIGO-Virgo third observing run (O3a): 105 GRBs detected by the Fermi and Swift satellites.

title: Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Shearing Flows: Energy Spectrum
authors: Frank M. Rieger, Peter Duffy
topic: We consider the acceleration of charged particles in relativistic shearing flows, with Lorentz factor up to Γ0-20. We present numerical solutions to the particle transport equation and compare these with results from analytical calculations. We show that in the highly relativistic limit the particle energy spectrum that results from acceleration approaches a power law, N(E)-E-q , with a universal value q =(1+a) for the slope of this power law, where a parameterizes the power-law momentum dependence of the particle mean free path. At mildly relativistic flow speeds, the energy spectrum becomes softer and sensitive to the underlying flow profile. We explore different flow examples, including Gaussian and power-law-type velocity profiles, showing that the latter yield comparatively harder spectra, producing q =2 for Γ0=3 and Kolmogorov turbulence. We provide a comparison with a simplified leaky-box approach and derive an approximate relation for estimating the spectral index as a function of the maximum shear flow speed. These results are of relevance for jetted, high-energy astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei, since shear acceleration is a promising mechanism for the acceleration of charged particles to relativistic energies and is likely to contribute to the high-energy radiation observed.

title: Universal Relations for the Increase in the Mass and Radius of a Rotating Neutron Star
authors: Andreas Konstantinou, Sharon M. Morsink
topic: Rotation causes an increase in a neutron star's mass and equatorial radius. The mass and radius depend sensitively on the unknown equation of state (EOS) of cold, dense matter. However, the increases in mass and radius due to rotation are almost independent of the EOS. The EOS independence leads to the idea of neutron star universality. In this paper, we compute sequences of rotating neutron stars with constant central density. We use a collection of randomly generated EOS to construct simple correction factors to the mass and radius computed from the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium for non-rotating neutron stars. The correction factors depend only on the non-rotating star's mass and radius and are almost independent of the EOS. This makes it computationally inexpensive to include observations of rotating neutron stars in EOS inference codes. We also construct a mapping from the measured mass and radius of a rotating neutron star to a corresponding non-rotating star. The mapping makes it possible to construct a zero-spin mass-radius curve if the masses and radii of many neutron stars with different spins are measured.
We show that the changes in polar and equatorial radii are symmetric, in that the polar radius shrinks at the same rate that the equatorial radius grows. This symmetry is related to the observation that the equatorial compactness (the ratio of mass to radius) is almost constant on one of the constant-density sequences.

title: Cosmic nucleosynthesis: a multi-messenger challenge
authors: Roland Diehl, Andreas Korn, Bruno Leibundgut, Maria Lugaro, Anton Wallner
topic: The origins of the elements and isotopes of cosmic material is a critical aspect of understanding the evolution of the universe. Nucleosynthesis typically requires physical conditions of high temperatures and densities. These are found in the Big Bang, in the interiors of stars, and in explosions with their compressional shocks and high neutrino and neutron fluxes. Many different tools are available to disentangle the composition of cosmic matter, in material of extraterrestrial origins such as cosmic rays, meteorites, stardust grains, lunar and terrestrial sediments, and through astronomical observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. Understanding cosmic abundances and their evolution requires combining such measurements with approaches of astrophysical, nuclear theories and laboratory experiments, and exploiting additional cosmic messengers, such as neutrinos and gravitational waves. Recent years have seen significant progress in almost all these fields; they are presented in this review. Models are required to explore nuclear fusion of heavier elements. These have been confirmed by observations of nucleosynthesis products in the ejecta of stars and supernovae, as captured by stardust grains and by characteristic lines in spectra seen from these objects, and also by ejecta material captured by Earth over millions of years in sediments. All these help to piece together how cosmic materials are transported in interstellar space and re-cycled into and between generations of stars. Our description of cosmic compositional evolution needs observational support, as it rests on several assumptions that appear challenged. This overview presents the flow of cosmic matter and the various sites of nucleosynthesis, as understood from combining many techniques and observations, towards the current knowledge of how the universe is enriched with elements.

title: Magnetorotational supernovae: A nucleosynthetic analysis of sophisticated 3D models
authors: Moritz Reichert, Martin Obergaulinger, Miguel-Angel Aloy, Michael Gabler, Almudena Arcones, Friedrich-Karl Thielemann
topic: Magnetorotational supernovae are a rare type of core-collapse supernovae where the magnetic field and rotation play a central role in the dynamics of the explosion. We present the post-processed nucleosynthesis of state-of-the-art neutrino-MHD supernova models that follow the post explosion evolution for few seconds. We find three different dynamical mechanisms to produce heavy r-process elements: i) a prompt ejection of matter right after core bounce, ii) neutron-rich matter that is ejected at late times due to a reconfiguration of the protoneutronstar shape, iii) small amount of mass ejected with high entropies in the center of the jet. We investigate total ejecta yields, including the ones of unstable nuclei such as 26Al, 44Ti, 56Ni, and 60Fe. The obtained 56Ni masses vary between 0.01-1Msun. The latter maximum is compatible with hypernova observations. Furthermore, all of our models synthesize Zn masses in agreement with observations of old metal-poor stars. We calculate simplified light curves to investigate whether our models can be candidates for superluminous supernovae. The peak luminosities obtained from taking into account only nuclear heating reach up to a few 1043ergs-1. Under certain conditions, we find a significant impact of the 66Ni decay chain that can raise the peak luminosity up to 38\% compared to models including only the 56Ni decay chain. This work reinforces the theoretical evidence on the critical role of magnetorotational supernovae to understand the occurrence of hypernovae, superluminous supernovae, and the synthesis of heavy elements.

title: Numerical Simulations of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Star Binaries
authors: Mattia Emma, Federico Schianchi, Francesco Pannarale, Violetta Sagun, Tim Dietrich
topic: Multi-messenger observations of compact binary mergers provide a new way to constrain the nature of dark matter that may accumulate in and around neutron stars. In this article, we extend the infrastructure of our numerical-relativity code BAM to enable the simulation of neutron stars that contain an additional mirror dark matter component. We perform single star tests to verify our code and the first binary neutron star simulations of this kind. We find that the presence of dark matter reduces the lifetime of the merger remnant and favors a prompt collapse to a black hole. Furthermore, we find differences in the merger time for systems with the same total mass and mass ratio, but different amounts of dark matter. Finally, we find that electromagnetic signals produced by the merger of binary neutron stars admixed with dark matter are very unlikely to be as bright as their dark matter free counterparts. Given the increasing sensitivity of multi-messenger facilities, our analysis gives a new perspective on how to probe the presence of dark matter.

title: Probing the multiwavelength emission scenario of GRB 190114C
authors: Marc Klinger (1), Donggeun Tak (1), Andrew Taylor (1), Sylvia J. Zhu
topic: Multiwavelength observation of the gamma-ray burst, GRB 190114C, opens a new window for studying the emission mechanism of GRB afterglows. Its Very-High-Energy (VHE; above 100 GeV) detection has motivated an inverse Compton interpretation for the emission, but this has not been tested. Here, we revisit the early afterglow emission from 68 to 180 seconds and perform the modeling likelihood analysis with the keV to TeV datasets. We compute for the first time the statistical preference in the combined synchrotron (syn) and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model over the syn-only model. In agreement with earlier analyses, between 68 and 110 seconds an unstable preference for the SSC model can be found, which can also be explained by systematic cross calibration effect between the included instruments. We conclude that there is no stable statistical preference for one of the two models.

title: The Structure of Gamma Ray Burst Jets
authors: Om Sharan Salafia, Giancarlo Ghirlanda
topic: Due to relativistic bulk motion, the structure and orientation of gamma-ray burst jets have a fundamental role in determining how they appear. The recent discovery of the GW170817 binary neutron star merger and the associated GRB boosted the interest in the modelling and search of signatures of the presence of a (possibly quasi-universal) jet structure in long and short GRBs. In this review, following a pedagogical approach, we summarize the history of GRB jet structure research over the last two decades, from the inception of the idea of a universal jet structure to the current understanding of the complex processes that shape the structure, that involve the central engine that powers the jet and the interaction of the latter with the progenitor vestige. We put some emphasis on the observable imprints of jet structure on prompt and afterglow emission and on the luminosity function, favoring intuitive reasoning over technical explanations.

title: Strong NIR emission following the long duration GRB 211211A: Dust heating as an alternative to a kilonova
authors: Eli Waxman, Eran O. Ofek, Doron Kushnir
topic: The prolonged near infrared (NIR) emission observed following the long duration GRB 211211A is inconsistent with afterglow emission from the shock driven into the circum-stellar medium (CSM), and with emission from a possible underlying supernova. It has therefore been suggested that the observed NIR flux is the signature of a kilonova -- a radioactive ejecta that is similar to the outcome of the binary neutron star merger GW170817. We propose here an alternative plausible explanation. We show that the NIR flux is consistent with thermal emission from dust, heated by UV radiation produced by the interaction of the GRB jet plasma with the CSM. This NIR emission was predicted by Waxman & Draine for GRBs residing near or withing massive molecular clouds. The dust NIR emission scenario is consistent with a GRB at z≲1. Inspection of the environment of GRB 211211A suggests that there are at least two host-galaxy candidates, one at z=0.076 and the other at z=0.459. The z=0.459 possibility is also consistent with the non-detection of a supernova signature in the light curve of the GRB afterglow, and with a typical GRB gamma-ray energy for the fluence of GRB 211211A.

title: Angular Momentum Transport in Proto-Neutron Stars and the Fate of Neutron Star Merger Remnants
authors: Ben Margalit, Adam S. Jermyn, Brian D. Metzger, Luke F. Roberts, Eliot Quataert
topic: Both the core collapse of rotating massive stars, and the coalescence of neutron star (NS) binaries, result in the formation of a hot, differentially rotating NS remnant. The timescales over which differential rotation is removed by internal angular-momentum transport processes ("viscosity") has key implications for the remnant's long-term stability and the NS equation-of-state (EOS). Guided by a non-rotating model of a cooling proto-NS, we estimate the dominant sources of viscosity using an externally imposed angular velocity profile Omega(r). Although the magnetorotational instability provides the dominant source of effective viscosity at large radii, convection and/or the Spruit-Tayler dynamo dominate in the core of merger remnants where dOmega/dr exceeds 0. Furthermore, the viscous timescale in the remnant core is sufficiently short that solid body rotation will be enforced faster than matter is accreted from rotationally-supported outer layers. Guided by these results, we develop a toy model for how the merger remnant core grows in mass and angular momentum due to accretion. We find that merger remnants with sufficiently massive and slowly rotating initial cores may collapse to black holes via envelope accretion, even when the total remnant mass is less than the usually considered threshold ≈1.2MTOV for forming a stable solid-body rotating NS remnant (where MTOV is the maximum non-rotating NS mass supported by the EOS). This qualitatively new picture of the post-merger remnant evolution and stability criterion has important implications for the expected electromagnetic counterparts from binary NS mergers and for multi-messenger constraints on the NS EOS.

title: Non-resonant particle acceleration in strong turbulence: comparison to kinetic and MHD simulations
authors: Virginia Bresci, Martin Lemoine, Laurent Gremillet, Luca Comisso, Lorenzo Sironi, Camilia Demidem
topic: Collisionless, magnetized turbulence offers a promising framework for the generation of non-thermal high-energy particles in various astrophysical sites. Yet, the detailed mechanism that governs particle acceleration has remained subject to debate. By means of 2D and 3D PIC, as well as 3D (incompressible) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we test here a recent model of non-resonant particle acceleration in strongly magnetized turbulence\cite{2021PhRvD.104f3020L}, which ascribes the energization of particles to their continuous interaction with the random velocity flow of the turbulence, in the spirit of the original Fermi model. To do so, we compare, for a large number of particles that were tracked in the simulations, the predicted and the observed histories of particles momenta. The predicted history is that derived from the model, after extracting from the simulations, at each point along the particle trajectory, the three force terms that control acceleration: the acceleration of the field line velocity projected along the field line direction, its shear projected along the same direction, and its transverse compressive part. Overall, we find a clear correlation between the model predictions and the numerical experiments, indicating that this non-resonant model can successfully account for the bulk of particle energization through Fermi-type processes in strongly magnetized turbulence. We also observe that the parallel shear contribution tends to dominate the physics of energization in the PIC simulations, while in the MHD incompressible simulation, both the parallel shear and the transverse compressive term provide about equal contributions.

title: Supernova Precursor Emission and the Origin of Pre-Explosion Stellar Mass-Loss
authors: Tatsuya Matsumoto, Brian D. Metzger
topic: A growing number of core collapse supernovae (SNe) which show evidence for interaction with dense circumstellar material (CSM) are accompanied by precursor optical emission rising weeks to months prior to the explosion. The precursor luminosities greatly exceed the Eddington limit of the progenitor star, implying they are accompanied by substantial mass-loss. Here, we present a semi-analytic model for SN precursor light curves which we apply to constrain the properties and mechanisms of the pre-explosion mass-loss. We explore two limiting mass-loss scenarios: (1) an eruption arising from shock break-out following impulsive energy deposition below the stellar surface; (2) a steady wind due to sustained heating of the progenitor envelope . The eruption model, which resembles a scaled-down version of Type IIP SNe, can explain the luminosities and timescales of well-sampled precursors, for ejecta masses 0.1-1Msun and velocities 100-1000kms-1. By contrast, the steady-wind scenario cannot explain the highest precursor luminosities 1041ergs-1, under the constraint that the total ejecta mass not exceed the entire progenitor mass (though the less-luminous SN 2020tlf precursor can be explained by a mass-loss rate 1Msunyr-1). However, shock interaction between the wind and pre-existing (earlier ejected) CSM may boost its radiative efficiency and mitigate this constraint. In both eruption and wind scenarios the precursor ejecta forms compact (1015 cm) optically-thick CSM at the time of core collapse; though only directly observable via rapid post-explosion spectroscopy (few days before being overtaken by the SN ejecta), this material can boost the SN luminosity via shock interaction.

title: Probing the progenitor of high-z short-duration GRB 201221D and its possible bulk acceleration in prompt emission
authors: Hao-Yu Yuan, Hou-Jun Lü, Ye Li, Bin-Bin Zhang, Hui Sun, Jared Rice, Jun Yang, En-Wei Liang
topic: The growing observed evidence shows that the long- and short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from massive star core-collapse and the merger of compact stars, respectively. GRB 201221D is a short-duration GRB lasting 0.1 s without extended emission (EE) at high redshift z=1.046. By analyzing data observed with the Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM, we find that a cutoff power-law model can adequately fit the spectrum with a soft Ep=113+9-7 keV, and isotropic energy Egamma,iso=1.36+0.17-0.14x1051 erg. In order to reveal the possible physical origin of GRB 201221D, we adopted multi-wavelength criteria (e.g., Amati relation, epsilon-parameter, amplitude parameter, local event rate density, luminosity function, and properties of the host galaxy), and find that most of the observations of GRB 201221D favor a compact star merger origin. Moreover, we find that alpha is larger than 2+beta in the prompt emission phase which suggests that the emission region is possibly undergoing acceleration during the prompt emission phase with a Poynting-flux-dominated jet.

title: A global test of jet structure and delay time distributions of short-duration gamma-ray bursts
authors: Jia-wei Luo, Ye Li, Shunke Ai, He Gao, Bing Zhang
topic: The multi-messenger joint observations of GW170817 and GRB170817A shed new light on the study of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). Not only did it substantiate the assumption that SGRBs originate from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, but it also confirms that the jet generated by this type of merger must be structured, hence the observed energy of an SGRB depends on the viewing angle from the observer. However, the precise structure of said jet is still subject to debate. Moreover, whether a single unified jet model can be applied to all SGRBs is hitherto unknown. Another uncertainty is the delay timescale of BNS mergers with respect to star formation history of the universe. In this paper, we conduct a global test of both delay and jet models of BNS mergers across a wide parameter space with simulated SGRBs. We compare the simulated peak flux, redshift and luminosity distributions with the observed ones and test the goodness-of-fit for a set of models and parameter combinations. Our simulations suggest that GW170817/GRB 170817A and all SGRBs can be understood within the framework of a universal structured jet viewed at different viewing angles. Furthermore, models invoking a jet plus cocoon structure with a lognormal delay timescale is most favored. Some other combinations (e.g. a Gaussian delay with a power-law jet model) are also acceptable. However, the Gaussian delay with Gaussian jet model and the entire set of power-law delay models can be ruled out.

title: Lanthanide Features in Near-infrared Spectra of Kilonovae
authors: Nanae Domoto, Masaomi Tanaka, Daiji Kato, Kyohei Kawaguchi, Kenta Hotokezaka, Shinya Wanajo
topic: The observations of GW170817/AT2017gfo have provided us with evidence that binary neutron star mergers are sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. However, the observed signatures in the spectra of GW170817/AT2017gfo have not been fully decoded especially in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. In this paper, we investigate the kilonova spectra over the entire wavelength range with the aim of elemental identification. We systematically calculate the strength of bound-bound transitions by constructing a hybrid line list that is accurate for important strong transitions and complete for weak transitions. We find that the elements on the left side of the periodic table, such as Ca, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, and Ce, tend to produce prominent absorption lines in the spectra. This is because such elements have a small number of valence electrons and low-lying energy levels, resulting in strong transitions. By performing self-consistent radiative transfer simulations for the entire ejecta, we find that La III and Ce III appear in the NIR spectra, which can explain the absorption features at Lambda-12000-14000 A in the spectra of GW170817/AT2017gfo. The mass fractions of La and Ce are estimated to be 2x10-6 and (1-100)x10-5, respectively. An actinide element Th can also be a source of absorption as the atomic structure is analogous to that of Ce. However, we show that Th III features are less prominent in the spectra because of the denser energy levels of actinides compared to those of lanthanides.

title: Skylight: a new code for general-relativistic ray-tracing and radiative transfer in arbitrary spacetimes
authors: Joaquín Pelle, Oscar Reula, Federico Carrasco, Carlos Bederian
topic: To reproduce the observed spectra and light curves originated in the neighborhood of compact objects requires accurate relativistic ray-tracing codes. In this work, we present Skylight, a new numerical code for general-relativistic ray tracing and radiative transfer in arbitrary space-time geometries and coordinate systems. The code is capable of producing images, spectra, and light curves from astrophysical models of compact objects as seen by distant observers. We incorporate two different schemes, namely Monte Carlo radiative transfer, integrating geodesics from the astrophysical region to distant observers, and camera techniques with backwards integration from the observer to the emission region. The code is validated by successfully passing several test cases, among them: thin accretion disks and neutron star hot spot emission.

title: The Cosmic History of Long Gamma Ray Bursts
authors: G. Ghirlanda, R. Salvaterra
topic: The cosmic formation rate of long Gamma Ray Bursts (LGRBs) encodes the evolution, across cosmic times, of their progenitors' properties and of their environment. The LGRB formation rate and the luminosity function, with its redshift evolution, are derived by reproducing the largest set of observations collected in the last four decades, namely the observer-frame prompt emission properties of GRB samples detected by the Fermi and Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) satellites and the redshift, luminosity and energy distributions of flux-limited, redshift complete, samples of GRBs detected by Swift. The model that best reproduces all these constraints consists of a GRB formation rate increasing with redshift (1+z)3.2, i.e. steeper than the star formation rate, up to z-3 followed by a decrease (1+z)-3. On top of this, our model predicts also a moderate evolution of the characteristic luminosity function break (1+z)0.6. Models with only luminosity or rate evolution are excluded at 5sigma significance. The cosmic rate evolution of LGRBs is interpreted as their preference to occur in environments with metallicity 12+log(O/H)less 8.6, consistently with theoretical models and host galaxy observations. The LGRB rate at z=0, accounting for their collimation, is rho0=79+57-33 Gpc-3 yr-1 (68\% confidence interval). This corresponds to 1\% of broad-line Ibc supernovae producing a successful jet in the local Universe. This fraction increases up to 7% at z gtr 3. Finally, we estimate that at least 0.2-0.7 yr-1 of Swift and Fermi detected bursts at z les 0.5 are jets observed slightly off-axis.

title: GRMHD simulations of neutron-star mergers with weak interactions: r-process nucleosynthesis and electromagnetic signatures of dynamical ejecta
authors: Luciano Combi, Daniel Siegel
topic: Fast material ejected dynamically over 10 ms during the merger of a binary neutron-star (BNS) system can give rise to distinctive electromagnetic counterparts to the system's gravitational-wave emission that can serve as a smoking gun to distinguish between a BNS and a NS-black-hole merger. We present novel ab-initio modeling of the associated kilonova precursor and kilonova afterglow based on three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of BNS mergers with tabulated, composition-dependent, finite-temperature equations of state (EOSs), weak interactions, and approximate neutrino transport. We analyze dynamical mass ejection from 1.35-1.35Msun binaries, typical of Galactic double-NS systems and consistent with properties of the first observed BNS merger GW170817, using three nuclear EOSs that span the range of allowed compactness. Nuclear reaction network calculations yield a robust 2nd-to-3rd-peak r-process. We find few x 1e-6Msun of fast (v 0.6c) ejecta that give rise to broad-band synchrotron emission on yr timescales, consistent with recent tentative evidence for excess X-ray/radio emission following GW170817. We find 2e-5Msun of free neutrons that power a kilonova precursor on h timescale. A boost in early UV/optical brightness by a factor of a few due to previously neglected relativistic effects, with appreciable enhancements up to 10h post-merger, provides promising prospects for future detection with UV/optical telescopes such as Swift or ULTRASAT out to 250Mpc. We find that a recently predicted opacity boost due to highly ionized lanthanides at 70000K is unlikely to affect the early kilonova lightcurve based on the obtained ejecta structures. Azimuthal inhomogeneities in dynamical ejecta composition for soft EOSs found here (lanthanide/actinide pockets) may have observable consequences for both early kilonova and late-time nebular emission.

title: Models of Millimeter and Radio Emission from Interacting Supernovae
authors: Nitika Yadlapalli, Vikram Ravi, Anna Y. Q. Ho
topic: This work utilizes established models of synchrotron-powered light curves for core-collapse supernovae in dense circumstellar environments, namely type IIn and Ibn, to demonstrate the potential for detecting millimeter emission from these events. The progenitor types of these supernovae are still an open question, but using the synchrotron light curves as probes for the circumstellar environments could shed light on the mass-loss histories of the progenitors and discern between different theories. Observations in millimeter bands are particularly fruitful, as they probe regions at smaller radii and higher ambient densities, where centimeter emission tends to be self-absorbed. In our application of these light curves, we explore a diversity of progenitor types and mass-loss profiles to understand their effects on the light curve shapes. Additionally, we fit model parameters to the 8\,GHz light curve of type IIn supernova 2006jd and then create millimeter light curves using these parameters to show the possibility of detecting an early millimeter peak from such an event. We predict that next generation millimeter surveys will possess the capability to detect nearby and extreme events. However, there is a pressing need for millimeter follow-up of optically discovered interacting supernovae to more completely sample the true population.

title: Magnetar Engines in Fast Blue Optical Transients and Their Connections with SLSNe, SNe Ic-BL, and lGRBs
authors: Jian-Feng Liu, Jin-Ping Zhu, Liang-Duan Liu, Yun-Wei Yu, Bing Zhang
topic: We fit the multi-band lightcurves of 40 fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) with the magnetar engine model. The mass of the FBOT ejecta, the initial spin period and polar magnetic field of the FBOT magnetars are respectively constrained to Mej=0.18+0.52-0.13Msun, Pi=9.4+8.1-3.9ms, and Bp=7+16-5x1014G. The wide distribution of the value of Bp spreads the parameter ranges of the magnetars from superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) to broad-line Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL; some are observed to be associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts), which are also suggested to be driven by magnetars. Combining FBOTs with the other transients, we find a strong universal anti-correlation as Pi - M-0.45ej, indicating them could share a common origin. To be specific, it is suspected that all of these transients originate from collapse of extreme-stripped stars in close binary systems, but with different progenitor masses. As a result, FBOTs distinct themselves by their small ejecta masses with an upper limit of -1Msun, which leads to an observational separation in the rise time of the lightcurves 12d. In addition, the FBOTs together with SLSNe can be separated from SNe Ic-BL by an empirical line in the Mpeak−trise plane corresponding to an energy requirement of a mass of 56Ni of 0.3Mej, where Mpeak is the peak absolute magnitude of the transients and trise is the rise time.

title: Observational Inference on the Delay Time Distribution of Short Gamma-ray Bursts
authors: Michael Zevin, Anya E. Nugent, Susmita Adhikari, Wen-fai Fong, Daniel E. Holz, Luke Zoltan Kelley
topic: The delay time distribution of neutron star mergers provides critical insights into binary evolution processes and the merger rate evolution of compact object binaries. However, current observational constraints on this delay time distribution rely on the small sample of Galactic double neutron stars (with uncertain selection effects), a single multimessenger gravitational-wave event, and indirect evidence of neutron star mergers based on r-process enrichment. We use a sample of 67 host galaxies of short gamma-ray bursts to place novel constraints on the delay time distribution, and leverage this result to infer the merger rate evolution of compact object binaries containing neutron stars. We recover a power-law slope of alpha=-1.82+0.40-0.41 and a minimum delay time of tmin=171+74-91 Myr (median and 90\% credible interval), with the maximum delay time constrained to tmax>7.73 Gyr at 99\% credibility. We find these constraints to be broadly consistent with theoretical expectations, although our recovered power-law slope is substantially steeper than the conventional value of t-1d, and our minimum delay time is larger than the typically assumed value of 10 Myr. Pairing this cosmological probe of the fate of compact object binary systems with the Galactic population of double neutron stars will be crucial for understanding the unique selection effects governing both of these populations. In addition to probing a significantly larger redshift regime of neutron star mergers than possible with current gravitational-wave detectors, complementing our results with future multimessenger gravitational-wave events will also help determine if short gamma-ray bursts ubiquitously result from compact object binary mergers.

title: Incorporating a radiative hydrodynamics scheme in the numerical-relativity code BAM
authors: Henrique Gieg, Federico Schianchi, Tim Dietrich, Maximiliano Ujevic
topic: To study binary neutron star systems and to interpret observational data such as gravitational-wave and kilonova signals, one needs an accurate description of the processes that take place during the final stages of the coalescence, e.g., through numerical-relativity simulations. In this work, we present an updated version of the numerical-relativity code BAM in order to incorporate nuclear-theory based Equations of State and a simple description of neutrino interactions through a Neutrino Leakage Scheme. Different test simulations, for stars undergoing a neutrino-induced gravitational collapse and for binary neutron stars systems, validate our new implementation. For the binary neutron stars systems, we show that we can evolve stably and accurately distinct microphysical models employing the different equations of state: SFHo, DD2, and the hyperonic BHBΛphi. Overall, our test simulations have good agreement with those reported in the literature.

topic: Kilonovae, one source of electromagnetic emission associated with neutron star mergers, are powered by the decay of radioactive isotopes in the neutron-rich merger ejecta. Models for kilonova emission consistent with available modeling and the electromagnetic counterpart to GW170817 also predict characteristic abundance patterns, determined by the relative balance of different types of material in the outflow. Assuming the observed source is prototypical, this inferred abundance pattern in turn must match \emph{r}-process abundances deduced by other means, such as what is observed in the solar system. We report on analysis comparing the input mass-weighted elemental compositions adopted in our radiative transfer simulations to the mass fractions of elements in the Sun. We characterise the extent to which our parameter inference results depend on our assumed composition for the dynamical and wind ejecta and examine how the new results compare to previous work. We find that a mass ratio of Mw/Md = 2.81 reproduces the observed AT2017gfo kilonova light curves while also producing the abundance of neutron-capture elements in the solar system.

topic: We present the stellar population properties of 68 short gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies, representing the largest uniformly-modeled sample to date. Using the Prospector stellar population inference code, we jointly fit the photometry and/or spectroscopy of each host galaxy. We find a population median redshift of z=0.60+0.90-0.34 (68\% confidence), including 10 new or revised photometric redshifts at z\gtr 1. We further find a median mass-weighted age of tm=0.85+2.49-0.57 Gyr, a stellar mass of log(Mstar/Msum)=9.69+0.95-0.66, a star formation rate of SFR=1.46+10.55-1.38Msun/yr, a stellar metallicity of log(Zstar/Zsun)=-0.4+0.46-0.42, and a dust attenuation of AV=0.51+0.94-0.43 mag (68\% confidence). Overall, the majority of short GRB hosts are star-forming (=85%), with small fractions that are either transitioning (=6%) or quiescent (=9%); however, we observe a much larger fraction (=60%) of quiescent and transitioning hosts at z=0.25, commensurate with galaxy evolution. We find that short GRB hosts populate the star-forming main sequence of normal field galaxies, but do not include as many high-mass galaxies, implying that their binary neutron star (BNS) merger progenitors are dependent on a combination of host star formation and stellar mass. The distribution of ages and redshifts implies a broad delay-time distribution, with a fast-merging channel at z high 1 and a decreased BNS formation efficiency at lower redshifts. Moreover, we find that short GRBs originate in environments with a wide range of stellar metallicities. If short GRB hosts are representative of BNS merger hosts within the horizon of current gravitational wave detectors, these results can inform future searches for electromagnetic counterparts.

title: Short GRB Host Galaxies I: Photometric and Spectroscopic Catalogs, Host Associations, and Galactocentric Offsets
authors: Wen-fai Fong (Northwestern/CIERA), Anya E. Nugent, Yuxin Dong, Edo Berger, Kerry Paterson, Ryan Chornock, Andrew Levan, Peter Blanchard, Kate D. Alexander, Jennifer Andrews, Bethany E. Cobb, Antonino Cucchiara et a;
topic: We present a comprehensive optical and near-infrared census of the fields of 90 short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) discovered in 2005-2021, constituting all short GRBs for which host galaxy associations are feasible (60\% of the total Swift short GRB population). We contribute 245 new multi-band imaging observations across 49 distinct GRBs and 25 spectra of their host galaxies. Supplemented by literature and archival survey data, the catalog contains 335 photometric and 40 spectroscopic data sets. The photometric catalog reaches 3σ depths of 24-27 mag and 23-26 mag for the optical and near-infrared bands, respectively. We identify host galaxies for 84 bursts, in which the most robust associations make up 54\% (49/90) of events, while only a small fraction, 6.7\%, have inconclusive host associations. Based on new spectroscopy, we determine 17 host spectroscopic redshifts with a range of z=0.15-1.6 and find that 25-4\4% of Swift short GRBs originate from z>1. We also present the galactocentric offset catalog for 83 short GRBs. Taking into account the large range of individual measurement uncertainties, we find a median of projected offset of 7.9 kpc, for which the bursts with the most robust associations have a smaller median of 4.9 kpc. Our catalog captures more high-redshift and low-luminosity hosts, and more highly-offset bursts than previously found, thereby diversifying the population of known short GRB hosts and properties. In terms of locations and host luminosities, the populations of short GRBs with and without detectable extended emission are statistically indistinguishable. This suggests that they arise from the same progenitors, or from multiple progenitors which form and evolve in similar environments. All of the data products are available on the BRIGHT website.

title: General Relativistic Implicit Monte Carlo Radiation-Hydrodynamics
authors: Nathaniel Roth, Peter Anninos, Peter B. Robinson, J. Luc Peterson, Brooke Polak, Tymothy K. Mangan, Kyle Beyer
topic: We report on a new capability added to our general relativistic radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code, Cosmos++: an implicit Monte Carlo (IMC) treatment for radiation transport. The method is based on a Fleck-type implicit discretization of the radiation-hydrodynamics equations, but generalized for both Newtonian and relativistic regimes. A multiple reference frame approach is used to geodesically transport photon packets (and solve the hydrodynamics equations) in the coordinate frame, while radiation-matter interactions are handled either in the fluid or electron frames then communicated via Lorentz boosts and orthonormal tetrad bases attached to the fluid. We describe a method for constructing estimators of radiation moments using path-weighting that generalizes to arbitrary coordinate systems in flat or curved spacetime. Absorption, emission, scattering, and relativistic Comptonization are among the matter interactions considered in this report. We discuss our formulations and numerical methods, and validate our models against a suite of radiation and coupled radiation-hydrodynamics test problems in both flat and curved spacetimes.

title: Tale of GRB 171010A/SN 2017htp and GRB 171205A/SN 2017iuk: Magnetar origin?
authors: Amit Kumar, Shashi B. Pandey, Rahul Gupta, Amar Aryan, Amit K. Ror, Saurabh Sharma, Nameeta Brahme
topic: We present late-time optical follow-up observations of GRB 171010A/SN 2017htp (z = 0.33) and low-luminosity GRB 171205A/SN 2017iuk (z = 0.037) acquired using the 4Kx4K CCD Imager mounted at the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope (3.6m DOT) along with the prompt emission data analysis of these two interesting bursts. The prompt characteristics (other than brightness) such as spectral hardness, T90, and minimum variability time-scale are comparable for both the bursts. The isotropic X-ray and kinetic energies of the plateau phase of GRB 171205A are found to be less than the maximum energy budget of magnetars, supporting magnetar as a central engine powering source. The new optical data of SN 2017htp and SN 2017iuk presented here, along with published ones, indicate that SN 2017htp is one of the brightest and SN 21017iuk is among the faintest GRB associated SNe (GRB-SNe). Semi-analytical light-curve modelling of SN 2017htp, SN 2017iuk and only known GRB associated superluminous supernova (SLSN 2011kl) are performed using the MINIM code. The model with a spin-down millisecond magnetar as a central engine powering source nicely reproduced the bolometric light curves of all three GRB-SNe mentioned above. The magnetar central engines for SN 2017htp, SN 2017iuk, and SLSN 2011kl exhibit values of initial spin periods higher and magnetic fields closer to those observed for long GRBs and H-deficient SLSNe. Detection of these rare events at such late epochs also demonstrates the capabilities of the 3.6m DOT for deep imaging considering longitudinal advantage in the era of time-domain astronomy.

title: Onset of particle acceleration during the prompt phase in gamma-ray bursts as revealed by synchrotron emission in GRB160821A
authors: Felix Ryde, Shabnam Iyyani, Björn Ahlgren, Asaf Peer, Vidushi Sharma, Christoffer Lundman, Magnus Axelsson
topic: The physical processes of the gamma-ray emission and particle acceleration during the prompt phase in GRBs are still unsettled. In order to perform an unambiguous physical modelling of observations, a clear identification of the emission mechanism is needed. An instance of a clear identification is the synchrotron emission during the very strong flare in GRB160821A, that occurs during the prompt phase at 135 s. Here we show that the distribution of the radiating electrons in this flare is initially very narrow, but later develops a power-law tail of accelerated electrons. We thus identify for the first time the onset of particle acceleration in a GRB jet. The flare is consistent with a late energy release from the central engine causing an external-shock as it encounters a preexisting ring nebula of a progenitor Wolf-Rayet star. Relativistic forward and reverse shocks develop, leading to two distinct emission zones with similar properties. The particle acceleration only occurs in the forward shock, moving into the dense nebula matter. Here, the magnetisation also decreases below the critical value, which allows for Fermi acceleration to operate. Using this fact, we find a bulk Lorentz factor of $420-770$, and an emission radius of R-1018 cm, indicating a tenuous gas of the immediate circumburst surrounding. The observation of the onset of particle acceleration thus gives new and independent constraints on the properties of the flow as well as on theories of particle acceleration in collisionless astrophysical shocks.

authors: Arvind Balasubramanian, Alessandra Corsi, Kunal P. Mooley, Kenta Hotokezaka, David L. Kaplan, Dale. A. Frail, Gregg Hallinan, Davide Lazzati, Eric J. Murphy
topic: GW170817 is the first binary neutron star (NS) merger detected in gravitational waves (GWs) and photons, and so far remains the only GW event of its class with a definitive electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. Radio emission from the structured jet associated with GW170817 has faded below the sensitivity achievable via deep radio observations with the most sensitive radio arrays currently in operation. Hence, we now have the opportunity to probe the radio re-brightening that some models predict, should emerge at late times from the interaction of the dynamically-stripped merger ejecta with the interstellar medium. Here we present the latest results from our deep radio observations of the GW170817 field with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), 4.5 years after the merger. Our new data at 3GHz do not show any compelling evidence for emission in excess to the tail of the jet afterglow (<3.3micJy), confirming our previous results. We thus set new constraints on the dynamical ejecta afterglow models. These constraints favor single-speed ejecta with energy ≲1050erg (for an ejecta speed of β0=0.5), or steeper energy-speed distributions of the kilonova ejecta. Our results also suggest larger values of the cold, non-rotating maximum NS mass in equal mass scenarios. However, without a detection of the dynamical ejecta afterglow, obtaining precise constraints on the NS equation of state remains challenging.

topic: We report the AGILE observations of GRB 220101A, which took place at the beginning of 1st January 2022 and was recognized as one of the most energetic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) ever detected since their discovery. The AGILE satellite acquired interesting data concerning the prompt phase of this burst, providing an overall temporal and spectral description of the event in a wide energy range, from tens of keV to tens of MeV. Dividing the prompt emission into three main intervals, we notice an interesting spectral evolution, featuring a notable hardening of the spectrum in the central part of the burst. The average fluxes encountered in the different time intervals are relatively moderate, with respect to those of other remarkable bursts, and the overall fluence exhibits a quite ordinary value among the GRBs detected by MCAL. However, GRB 220101A is the second farthest event detected by AGILE, and the burst with the highest isotropic equivalent energy of the whole MCAL GRB sample, releasing Eiso=2.54x10to54 erg and exhibiting an isotropic luminosity of Liso=2.34x10to52 erg/s (both in the 400 keV - 10 MeV energy range).
We also analyzed the first 10to6 s of the afterglow phase, using the publicly available Swift XRT data, carrying out a theoretical analysis of the afterglow, based on the forward shock model. We notice that GRB 220101A is with high probability surrounded with a wind-like density medium, and that the energy carried by the initial shock shall be a fraction of the total Eiso, presumably near 50.

title: On the diversity of magnetar-driven kilonovae
authors: Nikhil Sarin, Conor M. B. Omand, Ben Margalit, David I. Jones
topic: A non-negligible fraction of binary neutron star mergers are expected to form long-lived neutron star remnants, dramatically altering the multi-messenger signatures of a merger. Here, we extend existing models for magnetar-driven kilonovae and explore the diversity of kilonovae and kilonova afterglows. Focusing on the role of the (uncertain) magnetic field strength, we study the resulting electromagnetic signatures as a function of the external dipolar and internal toroidal fields. These two parameters govern, respectively, the competition between magnetic-dipole spindown and gravitational-wave spindown (due to magnetic-field deformation) of the rapidly-rotating remnant. We find that even in the parameter space where gravitational-wave emission is dominant, a kilonova with a magnetar central engine will be significantly brighter than one without an engine, as this parameter space is where more of the spin-down luminosity is thermalised. In contrast, a system with minimal gravitational-wave emission will produce a kilonova that may be difficult to distinguish from ordinary kilonovae unless early-epoch observations are available. However, as the bulk of the energy in this parameter space goes into accelerating the ejecta, such a system will produce a brighter kilonova afterglow that will peak on shorter times. To effectively hide the presence of the magnetar from the kilonova and kilonova afterglow, the rotational energy inputted into the ejecta must be 10-3-10-2Erot. We discuss the different diagnostics available to identify magnetar-driven kilonovae in serendipitous observations and draw parallels to other potential magnetar-driven explosions, such as superluminous supernovae and broad-line supernovae Ic.

title: Viscosity suppresses r-process viable outflows in global models of collapsar disks
authors: Oliver Just (1,2), Miguel A. Aloy (3,4), Martin Obergaulinger (3), Shigehiro Nagataki 
topic: Collapsar disks have been proposed to be rich factories of heavy elements, but the major question of whether their outflows are neutron-rich, and could therefore represent significant sites of the rapid neutron-capture (r-) process, or dominated by iron-group elements, remains unresolved. We present global models of collapsars that start from a stellar progenitor and self-consistently describe the evolution of the disk, its composition, and its outflows in response to the imploding stellar mantle using energy-dependent M1 neutrino transport and an alpha-viscosity to capture turbulent angular-momentum transport. We find that a neutron-rich, neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) is established only marginally--either for very short times or very low viscosities--because the disk tends to disintegrate into an advective disk (ADAF) soon after its formation, launching powerful outflows but preventing it from developing a hot and dense, and therefore neutron-rich core. Viscous outflows disrupt the star within 100 s with explosion energies close to that of hypernovae. If viscosity is neglected, a stable NDAF with disk mass of about 1 Msun is formed but is unable to release neutron-rich ejecta, while it produces a relatively mild explosion powered by a neutrino-driven wind blown off its surface. With ejecta electron fractions close to 0.5, all models presumably produce large amounts of 56Ni. Our results suggest that neutron-rich disks, and correspondingly r-process viable outflows, do not occur as readily as in remnant disks of neutron-star mergers. A weak effective viscosity generated by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence would improve the prospects for obtaining neutron-rich ejecta.

title: VLBI observations of GRB 201015A, a relatively faint GRB with a hint of Very High Energy gamma-ray emission

topic: GRB 201015A is a long-duration Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) which was detected at very high energies ( 100 GeV) using the MAGIC telescopes. If confirmed, this would be the fifth and least luminous GRB ever detected at this energies. We performed a radio follow-up of GRB 201015A over twelve different epochs, from 1.4 to 117 days post-burst, with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, e-MERLIN and the European VLBI Network. We included optical and X-rays observations, performed with the Multiple Mirror Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory respectively, together with publicly available data. We detected a point-like transient, consistent with the position of GRB 201015A until 23 and 47 days post-burst at 1.5 and 5 GHz, respectively. The source was detected also in both optical (1.4 and 2.2 days post-burst) and X-ray (8.4 and 13.6 days post-burst) observations. The multi-wavelength afterglow light curves can be explained with the standard model for a GRB seen on-axis, which expands and decelerates into a medium with a homogeneous density, while a circumburst medium with a wind-like profile is disfavoured. Notwithstanding the high resolution provided by the VLBI, we could not pinpoint any expansion or centroid displacement of the outflow. If the GRB is seen at the viewing angle which maximises the apparent velocity, we estimate that the Lorentz factor for the possible proper motion is Gamma < 40 in right ascension and Gamma < 1 in declination. On the other hand, if the GRB is seen on-axis, the size of the afterglow is <5 pc and <16 pc at 25 and 47 days. Finally, the early peak in the optical light curve suggests the presence of a reverse shock component before 0.01 days from the burst.

title: Modelling Populations of Kilonovae
authors: Christian N. Setzer, Hiranya V. Peiris, Oleg Korobkin, Stephan Rosswog
topic: The 2017 detection of a kilonova coincident with gravitational-wave emission has identified neutron star mergers as the major source of the heaviest elements, and dramatically constrained alternative theories of gravity. Observing a population of such sources has the potential to transform cosmology, nuclear physics, and astrophysics. However, with only one confident detection currently available, modelling the diversity of signals expected from such a population requires improved theoretical understanding. In particular, models which are quick to evaluate, and are calibrated with more detailed multi-physics simulations, are needed to design observational strategies for kilonovae detection, and to obtain rapid-response interpretations of new observations. We use grey-opacity models to construct populations of kilonovae, spanning ejecta parameters predicted by numerical simulations. Our modelling focuses on wavelengths relevant for upcoming optical surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In these simulations, we implement heating rates that are based on nuclear reaction network calculations. We create a Gaussian-process emulator for kilonova grey opacities, calibrated with detailed radiative transfer simulations. Using recent fits to numerical relativity simulations, we predict how the ejecta parameters from BNS mergers shape the population of kilonovae, accounting for the viewing-angle dependence. Our simulated population of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers produce peak i-band absolute magnitudes -17 Mi -11. A comparison with detailed radiative transfer calculations indicates that further improvements are needed to accurately reproduce spectral shapes over the full light curve evolution.

title: Polarization in early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts driven by precessing jets
authors: Bao-Quan Huang, Tong Liu
topic: Jet precessions are widely involved in astrophysical phenomena from galaxies to X-ray binaries and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Polarization presents a unique probe of the magnetic fields in GRB jets. The precession of GRBs relativistic jets will change the geometry within the observable emitting region of the jet, which can potentially affect the polarization of the afterglow. In this paper, wS. Giarratana, L. Rhodes, B. Marcote, R. Fender, G. Ghirlanda, M. Giroletti, L. Nava, J. M. Paredes, M. E. Ravasio, M. Ribo, M. Patel, J. Rastinejad, G. Schroeder, W. Fong, B. P. Gompertz, A. J. Levan, P. O'Briene take into account jet precession to study the polarization evolution and corresponding light curves in GRB early optical afterglows with ordered and random magnetic field geometries. We find that the jet precession in long-lived engines can significantly reduce the polarization degree (PD) regardless of the magnetic field structure. The strongest PD attenuation is found when the line of sight is aligned with the precession axis. Our results show that jet precession can provide new insight into the low PD measured in the early optical afterglows of GRBs.

title: Effect of Fluid Composition on a Jet Breaking Out of a Cocoon in Gamma-ray Bursts: A Relativistic de Laval Nozzle Treatment
authors: Mukesh K. Vyas
topic: In this paper, we carry out a semi-analytic general relativistic study of a Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) jet that is breaking out of a cocoon or stellar envelope. We solve hydrodynamic equations with the relativistic equation of state that takes care of fluid composition. In short GRBs, a general relativistic approach is required to account for curved spacetime in strong gravity. The piercing of the jet through the cocoon resembles a de Laval nozzle and the jet may go through recollimation shock transitions. We show that the possibility of shock transition and the shock properties are sensitive to the matter composition and the cocoon strength. Obtained Lorentz factors in thermally driven jets comfortably reach a few x10.

title: Gamma-ray bursts afterglow physics and the VHE domain
authors: Davide Miceli, Lara Nava
topic: Afterglow radiation in gamma-ray bursts (GRB), extending from the radio band to GeV energies, is produced as a result of the interaction between the relativistic jet and the ambient medium. Although in general the origin of the emission is robustly identified as synchrotron radiation from the shock-accelerated electrons, many aspects remain poorly constrained, such as the role of inverse Compton emission, the particle acceleration mechanism, the properties of the environment and of the GRB jet itself. The extension of the afterglow emission into the TeV band has been discussed and theorized for years, but has eluded for a long time the observations. Recently the Cherenkov telescopes MAGIC and H.E.S.S. have unequivocally proven that afterglow radiation is produced also above 100\,GeV, up to at least a few TeV. The accessibility of the TeV spectral window will largely improve with the upcoming facility CTA ({the} Cherenkov Telescope Array). In this review article, we first revise the current model for afterglow emission in GRBs, its limitations and open issues. Then we describe the recent detections of very high energy emission from GRBs and the origin of this radiation. Implications on the understanding of afterglow radiation and constraints on the physics of the involved processes will be deeply investigated, showing how future observations, especially {by} the CTA Observatory, are expected to give a key contribution in improving our comprehension of such elusive sources.

title: The Production of Actinides in Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Meng-Ru Wu, Projjwal Banerjee
topic: Although the multimessenger detection of the neutron star merger event GW170817 confirmed that mergers are promising sites producing the majority of nature's heavy elements via the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), a number of issues related to the production of translead nuclei -- the actinides -- remain to be answered. In this short review paper, we summarize the general requirements for actinide production in r-process and the impact of nuclear physics inputs. We also discuss recent efforts addressing the actinide production in neutron star mergers from different perspectives, including signatures that may be probed by future kilonova and γ-ray observations, the abundance scattering in metal-poor stars, and constraints put by the presence of short-lived radioactive actinides in the Solar system.

title: Signatures of R-process Enrichment in Supernovae from Collapsars
authors: Jennifer Barnes, Brian D. Metzger
topic: Despite recent progress, the astrophysical channels responsible for rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis remain an unsettled question. Observations of kilonovae following gravitational wave-detected neutron star mergers established mergers as one site of the r-process, but additional sources may be needed to fully explain r-process enrichment in the Universe. One intriguing possibility is that rapidly rotating massive stars undergoing core collapse launch r-process-rich outflows off the accretion disks formed from their infalling matter. In this scenario, r-process winds comprise one component of the supernova (SN) ejecta produced by "collapsar" explosions. We present the first systematic study of the effects of r-process enrichment on the emission from collapsar-generated SNe. We semi-analytically model r-process SN emission from explosion out to late times, and determine its distinguishing features. The ease with which r-process SNe can be identified depends on how effectively wind material mixes into the initially r-process-free outer layers of the ejecta. In many cases, enrichment produces a near infrared (NIR) excess that can be detected within 75 days of explosion. We also discuss optimal targets and observing strategies for testing the r-process collapsar theory, and find that frequent monitoring of optical and NIR emission from high-velocity SNe in the first few months after explosion offers a reasonable chance of success while respecting finite observing resources. Such early identification of r-process collapsar candidates also lays the foundation for nebular-phase spectroscopic follow-up in the near- and mid-infrared, for example with the James Webb Space Telescope.

topic: Sub-relativistic materials launched during the merger of binary compact objects and the core-collapse of massive stars acquire velocity structures when expanding in a stratified environment. The remnant (either a spinning magnetized neutron star (NS) or a central black hole) from the compact-object or core-collapse could additionally inject energy into the afterglow via spin-down luminosity or/and by accreting fall-back material, producing a refreshed shock, modifying the dynamics, and leading to rich radiation signatures at distinct timescales and energy bands with contrasting intensities. We derive the synchrotron light curves evolving in a stratified environment when a power-law velocity distribution parametrizes the energy of the shock, and the remnant continuously injects energy into the blastwave. As the most relevant case, we describe the latest multi-wavelength afterglow observations (900 days) of the GW170817/GRB 170817A event via a synchrotron afterglow model with energy injection of a sub-relativistic material. The features of the remnant and the synchrotron emission of the sub-relativistic material are consistent with a spinning magnetized NS and the faster "blue" kilonova afterglow, respectively. Using the multi-band observations of some short-bursts with evidence of kilonova, we provide constraints on the expected afterglow emission.

title: Fermi-LAT detection of a GeV afterglow from a compact stellar merger
authors: Hai-Ming Zhang, Yi-Yun Huang, Jian-He Zheng, Ruo-Yu Liu, Xiang-Yu Wang
topic: It is usually thought that long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are associated with massive star core collapse whereas short-duration GRBs are associated with mergers of compact stellar binaries. The discovery of a kilonova associated with a nearby (350 Mpc) long-duration GRB- GRB 211211A, however, indicates that the progenitor of this long-duration GRB is a compact object merger. Here we report the \emph{Fermi}-LAT detection of gamma-ray (100 MeV) afterglow emission from GRB 211211A, which lasts 20000 s after the burst, the longest event for conventional short-duration GRBs ever detected. We suggest that this gamma-ray emission results from afterglow synchrotron emission. The soft spectrum of GeV emission may arise from a limited maximum synchrotron energy of only a few hundreds of MeV at 20000 s. The usually long duration of the GeV emission could be due to the proximity of this GRB and the long deceleration time of the GRB jet that is expanding in a low density cricumburst medium, consistent with the compact stellar merger scenario.

title: Electromagnetic precursor flares from the late inspiral of neutron star binaries
authors: Elias R. Most, Alexander A. Philippov
topic: The coalescence of two neutron stars is accompanied by the emission of gravitational waves, and can also feature electromagnetic counterparts powered by mass ejecta and the formation of a relativistic jet after the merger. Since neutron stars can feature strong magnetic fields, the non-trivial interaction of the neutron star magnetospheres might fuel potentially powerful electromagnetic transients prior to merger. A key process powering those precursor transients is relativistic reconnection in strong current sheets formed between the two stars. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of how the twisting of the common magnetosphere of the binary leads to an emission of electromagnetic flares, akin to those produced in the solar corona. By means of relativistic force-free electrodynamics simulations, we clarify the role of different magnetic field topologies in the process. We conclude that flaring will always occur for suitable magnetic field alignments, unless one of the neutron stars has a magnetic field significantly weaker than the other.

title: Multi-messenger constraints on the Hubble constant through combination of gravitational waves, gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae from neutron star mergers
authors: Mattia Bulla, Michael W. Coughlin, Suhail Dhawan, Tim Dietrich
topic: The simultaneous detection of gravitational waves and light from the binary neutron star merger GW170817 led to independent measurements of distance and redshift, providing a direct estimate of the Hubble constant H0 that does not rely on a cosmic distance ladder nor assumes a specific cosmological model. By using gravitational waves as ''standard sirens'', this approach holds promise to arbitrate the existing tension between the H0 value inferred from the cosmic microwave background and those obtained from local measurements. However, the known degeneracy in the gravitational-wave analysis between distance and inclination of the source lead to a H0 value from GW170817 that was not precise enough to resolve the existing tension. In this review, we summarize recent works exploiting the viewing-angle dependence of the electromagnetic signal, namely the associated short gamma-ray burst and kilonova, to constrain the system inclination and improve on H0. We outline the key ingredients of the different methods, summarize the results obtained in the aftermath of GW170817 and discuss the possible systematics introduced by each of these methods.

topic: We present 𝙽𝚁𝙿𝙼𝚠, an analytical model of gravitational-waves from neutron star merger remnants informed using 618 numerical relativity (NR) simulations. 𝙽𝚁𝙿𝙼𝚠 is designed in the frequency domain using a combination of complex Gaussian wavelets. The wavelet's parameters are calibrated to equations of state (EOS) insensitive relations from NR data. The NR simulations are computed with 21 EOS (7 of which are finite-temperature microphysical models, and 3 of which contain quark phase transitions or hyperonic degrees of freedom) and span total binary masses M in[2.4,3.4] Msun, mass ratios up to q=2, and (nonprecessing) dimensionless spins magnitudes up to 0.2. The theoretical uncertainties of the EOS-insensitive relations are incorporated in 𝙽𝚁𝙿𝙼𝚠 using recalibration parameters that enhance the flexibility and accuracy of the model. 𝙽𝚁𝙿𝙼𝚠 is NR-faithful with fitting factors 0.9 computed on an independent validation set of 102 simulations.

topic: Turbulence plays an integral role in astrophysical phenomena, including core-collapse supernovae (CCSN). Unfortunately, current simulations must resort to using subgrid models for turbulence treatment, as direct numerical simulations (DNS) are too expensive to run. However, subgrid models used in CCSN simulations lack accuracy compared to DNS results. Recently, Machine Learning (ML) has shown impressive prediction capability for turbulence closure. We have developed a physics-informed, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to preserve the realizability condition of Reynolds stress that is necessary for accurate turbulent pressure prediction. The applicability of the ML model was tested for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence subgrid modeling in both stationary and dynamic regimes. Our future goal is to utilize our ML methodology within the MHD CCSN framework to investigate the effects of accurately-modeled turbulence on the explosion rate of these events.

topic: An energetic γ-ray burst (GRB), GRB 211211A, was observed on 2021 December 11 by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Despite its long duration, typically associated with bursts produced by the collapse of massive stars, the discovery of an optical-infrared kilonova and a quasi-periodic oscillation during a gamma-ray precursor points to a compact object binary merger origin. The complete understanding of this nearby (1 billion light-years) burst will significantly impact our knowledge of GRB progenitors and the physical processes that lead to electromagnetic emission in compact binary mergers. Here, we report the discovery of a significant (5sigma) transient-like emission in the high-energy gamma-rays (HE; E larger 0.1 GeV) observed by Fermi/LAT starting at 103 s after the burst. After an initial phase with a roughly constant flux (5x10-10 erg s-1 cm-2) lasting 2x104 s, the flux started decreasing and soon went undetected. The multi-wavelength afterglow emission observed at such late times is usually in good agreement with synchrotron emission from a relativistic shock wave that arises as the GRB jet decelerates in the interstellar medium. However, our detailed modelling of a rich dataset comprising public and dedicated multi-wavelength observations demonstrates that GeV emission from GRB 211211A is in excess with respect to the expectation of this scenario. We explore the possibility that the GeV excess is inverse Compton emission due to the interaction of a long-lived, low-power jet with an external source of photons. We discover that the kilonova emission can provide the necessary seed photons for GeV emission in binary neutron star mergers.

title: Thinking outside the box: Numerical Relativity with particles
authors: S. Rosswog, P. Diener, F. Torsello
topic: The observation of gravitational waves from compact objects has now become an active part of observational astronomy. For a sound interpretation, one needs to compare such observations against detailed Numerical Relativity simulations, which are essential tools to explore the dynamics and physics of compact binary mergers. To date, essentially all simulation codes that solve the full set of Einstein's equations are performed in the framework of Eulerian hydrodynamics. The exception is our recently developed Numerical Relativity code \SpB which solves the commonly used BSSN formulation of Einstein equations on a structured mesh and the matter equations via Lagrangian particles. We show here, for the first time, \SpB neutron star merger simulations with piecewise polytropic approximations to four nuclear matter equations of state. We introduce some further methodological refinements (a new way of steering dissipation, an improved particle-mesh mapping) and we explore the impact of the exponent that enters in the calculation of the thermal pressure contribution. We find that it leaves a noticeable imprint on the gravitational wave amplitude (calculated via both quadrupole approximation and the Psi4-formalism) and has a noticeable impact on the amount of dynamic ejecta. Consistent with earlier findings, we only find a few times 10-3 Msun as dynamic ejecta in the studied equal mass binary systems, with softer equations of state (which are more prone to shock formation) ejecting larger amounts of matter. We also see a credible high-velocity (0.5..0.7c) ejecta component of 10-4 Msun in all our cases. Such a high-velocity component has been suggested to produce an early, blue precursor to the main kilonova emission and it could also potentially cause a kilonova afterglow.

topic: The multi-messenger detection of the gravitational-wave signal GW170817, the corresponding kilonova AT2017gfo and the short gamma-ray burst GRB170817A, as well as the observed afterglow has delivered a scientific breakthrough. For an accurate interpretation of all these different messengers, one requires robust theoretical models that describe the emitted gravitational-wave, the electromagnetic emission, and dense matter reliably. In addition, one needs efficient and accurate computational tools to ensure a correct cross-correlation between the models and the observational data. For this purpose, we have developed the NMMA (Nuclear-physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics) framework. The code allows incorporation of nuclear-physics constraints at low densities as well as X-ray and radio observations of isolated neutron stars. It also enables us to classify electromagnetic observations, e.g., to distinguish between supernovae and kilonovae. In previous works, the NMMA code has allowed us to constrain the equation of state of supranuclear dense matter, to measure the Hubble constant, and to compare dense-matter physics probed in neutron-star mergers and in heavy-ion collisions. The extension of the NMMA code presented here is the first attempt of analysing the gravitational-wave signal, the kilonovae, and the GRB afterglow simultaneously, which reduces the uncertainty of our constraints. Incorporating all available information, we estimate the radius of a 1.4 solar mass neutron star to be

title: GRB 220426A: a thermal radiation dominated gamma-ray burst
authors: Yun Wang, Tian-Ci Zheng, Zhi-Ping Jin
topic: The physical composition of the ejecta of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an open question. The radiation mechanism of the prompt gamma-rays is also in debate. This problem can be solved for the bursts hosting distinct thermal radiation. However, the events with dominant thermal spectral components are still rare. In this work, we focus on GRB 220426A, a recent event detected by Fermi-GBM. The time-resolved and time-integrated data analyses yield very hard low-energy spectrum but rather soft high-energy spectrum. This means that the spectra of GRB 220426A are narrowly distributed, similar to GRB 090902B. And the Bayesian inference results are in favor of the multicolor blackbody (mBB) model. The physical properties of the relativistic outflow are calculated. Assuming a redshift z=1.4, the bulk Lorentz factors of the shells are found to be between 274.15 and 827.03, and the corresponding photosphere radii Rph are in the range of 1.83x1011 and 2.97x1012 cm. Similar to GRB 090902B, the time-resolved properties of GRB 220426A satisfy the observed correlations

topic: We report detailed prompt emission observations and analysis of the very bright and long GRB 210619B, detected by the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) installed on the International Space Station ({\it ISS}) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on-board the Fermi mission. Our main goal is to understand the radiation mechanisms and jet composition of GRB 210619B. With a measured redshift of z = 1.937 we find that GRB 210619B falls within the 10 most luminous bursts observed by Fermi so far. The energy-resolved prompt emission light curve of GRB 210619B exhibits an extremely bright hard emission pulse followed by softer/longer emission pulses. The low-energy photon indices (pt) values obtained using the time-resolved spectral analysis of the burst reveal a transition between the thermal (during harder pulse) to non-thermal (during softer pulse) outflow. We examine the correlation between spectral parameters and find that both peak energy and αpt exhibit the flux tracking pattern. The late time broadband photometric dataset can be explained within the framework of the external forward shock model with num nuc nux (where num, nuc, and nux are the synchrotron peak, cooling-break, and X-ray frequencies, respectively) spectral regime supporting a rarely observed hard electron energy index (p < 2). We find moderate values of host extinction of E(B-V) = 0.14 pm 0.01 for the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction law. In addition, we also report late-time optical observations with the 10.4\,m GTC placing deep upper limits for the host galaxy (located at z=1.937), favouring a faint, dwarf host for the burst.

topic: Magnetars, a population of isolated neutron stars with ultra-strong magnetic fields of 1014-1015 G, have been increasingly accepted to explain a variety of astrophysical transients. A nascent millisecond-period magnetar can release its spin-down energy and power bright sources such as Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) and their subsequent X-ray plateaus, Super Luminous Supernovae (SLSNe), and the fast X-ray transients such as CDF-S XT-2. Magnetars with ages of 103-104 years have been observed within the Milky Way Galaxy, which are found to power diverse transients with the expense of their magnetic energy, in the form of giant flares and repeated soft-gamma-ray or hard X-ray bursts and occasionally fast radio bursts (FRBs). Magnetar giant flares were also detected as disguised short GRBs from nearby galaxies . Here we report the identification of a GRB as a hyper flare of magnetar in a nearby galaxy. The magnitude of the hyper flare is about one thousand times brighter than that of a typical magnetar giant flare. A significant 80 millisecond period is detected in the decaying light curve. Interpreting this period as the rotation period and given a magnetic field strength typical for a young magnetar, the age of the magnetar is constrained to be only a few weeks. The non-detection of a (superluminous) supernova nor a GRB weeks before the event further constrains that the magnetar is likely born from an off-axis merger event of two neutron stars. Our finding bridges the gap between the hypothetical millisecond magnetars and the observed Galactic magnetars, and points toward a broader channel of magnetar-powered gamma-ray transients.

title: On LGRB progenitors: an approach from thermally-produced neutrinos
authors: Gibran Morales, Nissim Fraija
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are the most intense electromagnetic (EM) sources in the Universe. Long GRB (LGRB) correspond to those events with a typical prompt emission of more than a few seconds. It is generally assumed that they are originated after an implosion of a very massive star within a central compact object engine that can be either a black hole (BH) or a rapidly-spinning highly-magnetized neutron star (NS). Nevertheless, one of the most challenging aspects of defining a unique model is that the progenitor remains initially hidden for direct EM observation. In this work, we investigate the evolution of thermally-produced neutrino properties in both GRB progenitors to provide an alternative solution. We consider the characteristics of both progenitors and the fireball scenario to calculate the oscillation probabilities within a three-flavor admixture regime. Then we obtain the expected neutrino ratio and we also estimate the number of events from these sources that could be detected in the future Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) detector, considering a sample of previously observed GRB with remarkably signs of being magnetar-produced. Our findings indicate that examining the predicted neutrino rates result in an additional mechanism to determine the type of progenitor associated with these events. This is especially useful when, for instance, we cannot directly observe an electromagnetic counterpart, such as so-called "failed" GRB with hidden jets, or when light curve analysis is inconclusive.

title: Gamma-Ray Bursts at TeV Energies: Theoretical Considerations
authors: Ramandeep Gill, Jonathan Granot
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous explosions in the Universe and are powered by ultra-relativistic jets. Their prompt gamma-ray emission briefly outshines the rest of the gamma-ray sky making them detectable from cosmological distances. It is followed by, and sometimes partially overlaps with, a similarly energetic but very broadband and longer-lasting afterglow emission. While most GRBs are detected below a few MeV, over a hundred were detected at high (0.1GeV) energies and several have now been observed up to tens of GeV with the \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT). A new electromagnetic window in the very high energy (VHE) domain (0.1TeV) was recently opened with the detection of afterglow emission in the (0.1\textendash1)TeV energy band by ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. The emission mechanism for the VHE spectral component is not fully understood, and its detection offers important constraints for GRB physics. This review provides a brief overview of the different leptonic and hadronic mechanisms capable of producing VHE emission in GRBs. The same mechanisms possibly give rise to the high-energy spectral component seen during the prompt emission of many \textit{Fermi}-LAT GRBs. Possible origins of its delayed onset and long duration, well into the afterglow phase, with implications for the emission region and relativistic collisionless shock physics are discussed. Key results for using GRBs as ideal probes for constraining models of extra-galactic background light and intergalactic magnetic fields, as well as for testing Lorentz invariance violation, are presented.

title: Particle acceleration in galactic wind bubbles
authors: Enrico Peretti
topic: Winds are ubiquitous in galaxies and often feature bubble structures. These wind bubbles are characterized by an external forward shock expanding in the surrounding medium and a wind termination shock separating the cool and fast wind from the hot shocked wind. While the forward shock could not be able to accelerate particles efficiently for a long time, at the wind termination shock the necessary conditions for efficient acceleration may be present. We develop a model for particle acceleration at the termination shock of such bubbles analysing the consequences of different possible engines powering the wind. We finally explore the multi-messenger potential of galactic winds in terms of escaping cosmic rays and high-energy gamma rays and neutrinos produced through hadronic interactions.

title: Comprehensive study on the mass ejection and nucleosynthesis in the binary neutron star mergers leaving short-lived massive neutron stars
authors: Sho Fujibayashi, Kenta Kiuchi, Shinya Wanajo, Koutarou Kyutoku, Yuichiro Sekiguchi, Masaru Shibata
topic: By performing a set of numerical relativity simulations for the merger of binary neutron stars with several mass ratios, the properties of ejected matter in dynamical and post-merger phases are investigated for the cases in which the remnant massive neutron star collapses into a black hole in ≲20 ms after the onset of merger. The dynamical mass ejection is investigated in three-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations with an approximate neutrino-radiation transfer. The resulting post-merger systems are then mapped onto the axisymmetric ones and used as the initial conditions of axisymmetric long-term radiation-hydrodynamics simulations supposing that the effective viscosity should arise as a result of magnetohydrodynamical activity in the post-merger system. We show that the typical electron fraction of the dynamical ejecta is lower for the merger of more asymmetric binaries, and hence, heavier r-process nuclei are dominantly synthesized. We also show that the post-merger ejecta has only a mild neutron-richness, which results in the production of lighter r-process nuclei, irrespective of the binary mass ratio and that the ejecta mass is larger for the merger of more asymmetric binaries due to the larger disk mass. Thus, for the asymmetric merger case, the underproduction of lighter r-process nuclei can be compensated by the post-merger ejecta. As a result, by summing up both ejecta components, the solar residual r-process pattern is approximately reproduced irrespective of the binary mass ratio. Implications of our results associated with the mass distribution of compact NS binaries and the magnetar scenario of short gamma-ray bursts are discussed.

authors: Yukikatsu Terada (1) (2), Yuya Miwa (1), Hayato Ohsumi (1), Shin-ichiro Fujimoto (3), Satoru Katsuda (1), Aya Bamba (4), Ryo Yamazaki 
topic: We perform a full nuclear-network numerical calculation of the r-process nuclei in binary neutron-star mergers (NSMs), with the aim of estimating gamma-ray emissions from the remnants of Galactic NSMs up to 106 years old. The nucleosynthesis calculation of 4,070 nuclei is adopted to provide the elemental composition ratios of nuclei with an electron fraction Ye between 0.10 and 0.45 . The decay processes of 3,237 unstable nuclei are simulated to extract the gamma-ray spectra. As a result, the NSMs have different spectral color in gamma-ray band from various other astronomical objects at less than 105 years old. In addition, we propose a new line-diagnostic method for Ye that uses the line ratios of either 137mBa/85K or 243Am/60mCo, which become larger than unity for young and old r-process sites, respectively, with a low Ye environment. From an estimation of the distance limit for gamma-ray observations as a function of the age, the high sensitivity in the sub-MeV band, at approximately 10-9 photons s-1 cm-2 or 10-15 erg s-1 cm-2, is required to cover all the NSM remnants in our Galaxy if we assume that the population of NSMs by \citet{2019ApJ...880...23W}. A gama-ray survey with sensitivities of 10-8--10-7 photons in the 70--4000 keV band is expected to find emissions from at least one NSM remnant under the assumption of NSM rate of 30 Myr-1. The feasibility of γ-ray missions to observe Galactic NSMs are also studied.

title: Modelling the host galaxies of binary compact object mergers with observational scaling relations
authors: Filippo Santoliquido, Michela Mapelli, M. Celeste Artale, Lumen Boco
topic: The merger rate density evolution of binary compact objects and the properties of their host galaxies carry crucial information to understand the sources of gravitational waves. Here, we present galaxyRate, a new code that estimates the merger rate density of binary compact objects and the properties of their host galaxies, based on observational scaling relations. We generate our synthetic galaxies according to the galaxy stellar mass function of star forming and passive galaxies. We estimate the metallicity according to both the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). Also, we take into account galaxy-galaxy mergers and the evolution of the galaxy properties from the formation to the merger of the binary compact object. We find that the merger rate density evolution with redshift changes dramatically depending on the choice of the star-forming galaxy main sequence, especially in the case of binary black holes (BBHs) and black hole neutron star systems (BHNSs). The slope of the merger rate density evolution of BBHs and BHNSs is steeper if we assume the MZR with respect to the FMR, because the latter predicts a shallower decrease of metallicity with redshift. In contrast, binary neutron stars (BNSs) are only mildly affected by both the galaxy main sequence and metallicity relation. Overall, BBHs and BHNSs tend to form in low-mass metal-poor galaxies and merge in high-mass metal-rich galaxies, while BNSs form and merge in massive galaxies. The metallicity distribution of the host galaxies is significantly affected by the adopted metallicity relation. We predict that passive galaxies host at least 5-10 \%, 15-25 \%, and 15-35 \% of all BNS, BHNS and BBH mergers in the local Universe.

title: GRB 211211A: prolonged central engine under strong magnetic field environment
authors: He Gao, Wei-Hua Lei, Zi-Pei Zhu
topic: Recently, a Kilonova-associated gamma-ray burst (GRB 211211A) has attracted great attentions, whose lightcurve consists a precursor (0.2 s), a hard spiky emission (10 s), and a soft long extended emission (40 s). Kilonova association could prove its merger origin, while the detection of the precursor infers at least one highly magnetized NS being involved in the merger. In this case, a strong magnetic flux F is expected to surround the central engine of GRB 211211A. Here we suggest that when F is large enough, the accretion flow could be halted far from the innermost stable radius, which will significantly prolong the lifetime of the accretion process, so as the GRB duration. For example, we show that as long as the central BH is surrounded by a strong magnetic flux F=1029cm2G, an accretion flow with Mini=0.1Msun s-1 could be halted at 40 times gravitational radius and slowly transfer into the black hole in order of -10 s, which naturally explains the duration of hard spiky emission. After most of the disk mass has been accreted onto the BH, the inflow rate will be reduced, so a long and soft extended emission is expected when a new balance between the magnetic field and the accretion current is reconstructed at a further radius. Our results further support that the special behavior of GRB 211211A is mainly due to the strong magnetic field of its progenitor stars. Multi-messenger detections of GRB 211211A-like events (sometimes may disguise as a typical LGRBs without extended emission) could help to diagnose their progenitor system and to better study the events of compact binary mergers involving high magnetic field NSs.

topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are intense episodes of high-energy emission seen isotropically across the sky and all through cosmic time. For decades, they have been broadly divided into long- and short-duration bursts, lasting more or less than 2s, respectively, but it has been apparent for several years that this dichotomy is imperfect. The split does not map directly to the two progenitor channels that are known to produce GRBs -- the merger of compact objects (merger-GRBs) or the collapse of massive stars (collapsar-GRBs). In particular, the merger population (typically short-duration) also includes bursts with a short, hard less 2s spike and subsequent longer, softer extended emission (EE). There have also been examples of apparent short bursts in which supernova detections indicate a collapsar origin. The recent discovery of a kilonova -- the radioactive glow of heavy elements made in neutron star mergers -- in the 50s-duration GRB 211211A further complicates this picture, demonstrating that mergers can drive GRBs with complex and long-lived light curves whose broad spectral and temporal properties are consistent with the collapsar population. Here we present detailed analysis of the high energy emission associated with GRB 211211A. We demonstrate that the rapidly-evolving spectrum can be fit by purely synchrotron emission with both the peak and cooling frequencies moving through the gamma-ray band, down to the X-rays. This is the first time that such spectral evolution has been demonstrated in a merger-GRB, and we show that it drives the extended emission signature at late times. The remarkable consistency of these signatures across the population suggests that GRB 211211A may provide a unifying blueprint for identifying long-duration GRBs from mergers, potentially paving the way for strong diagnostics of the progenitor type.

title: Implementation of advanced Riemann solvers in a neutrino-radiation magnetohydrodynamics code in numerical relativity and its application to a binary neutron star merger
authors: Kenta Kiuchi, Loren E. Held, Yuichiro Sekiguchi, Masaru Shibata
topic: We implement advanced Riemann solvers HLLC and HLLD \cite{Mignone:2005ft,MUB:2009} together with an advanced constrained transport scheme \cite{Gardiner:2007nc} in a numerical-relativity neutrino-radiation magnetohydrodynamics code. We validate our implementation by performing a series of one- and multi-dimensional test problems for relativistic hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics in both Minkowski spacetime and a static black hole spacetime. We find that the numerical solutions with the advanced Riemann solvers are more accurate than those with the HLLE solver \cite{DelZanna:2002rv}, which was originally implemented in our code. As an application to numerical relativity, we simulate an asymmetric binary neutron star merger leading to a short-lived massive neutron star both with and without magnetic fields. We find that the lifetime of the rotating massive neutron star formed after the merger and also the amount of the tidally-driven dynamical ejecta are overestimated when we employ the diffusive HLLE solver. We also find that the magnetorotational instability is less resolved when we employ the HLLE solver because of the solver's large numerical diffusivity. This causes a spurious enhancement both of magnetic winding resulting from large scale poloidal magnetic fields, and also of the energy of the outflow induced by magnetic pressure.

title: R-process Rain from Binary Neutron Star Mergers in the Galactic Halo
authors: Benjamin Amend, Jonathan Zrake, Dieter H. Hartmann
topic: Compact binary mergers involving at least one neutron star are promising sites for the synthesis of r-process elements found in stars and planets. However, mergers are generally thought to take place at high galactic latitudes, far from any star-forming regions of the host galaxy. It is thus important to understand the physical mechanisms involved in transporting enriched material from the gas environments of the galactic halo to the star-forming disk. We investigate these processes, starting from an explosive injection event and its interaction with the halo gas medium. We show that the total outflow mass in compact binary mergers is far too low for the material to travel to the disk in a ballistic fashion. Instead, the enriched ejecta is swept into a shell, which decelerates over 1-10 pc scales, and becomes corrugated by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The corrugated shell is denser than the ambient medium, and breaks into clouds which then sink toward the disk. The sinking clouds lose thermal energy through radiative cooling, and are also ablated by shearing instabilities. We present a dynamical heuristic that models these effects, and would predict the delay times for delivery to the disk. However, we find that turbulent mass ablation is extremely efficient, and leads to the total fragmentation of sinking r-process clouds over 105 yr. We thus predict that enriched material from halo injection events quickly assimilates into the gas medium of the halo, and that enriched mass flow to the disk could only be accomplished by turbulent diffusion or large-scale inflowing mass currents.

topic: We present the discovery of the first millimeter afterglow of a short-duration gamma-ray burst (SGRB) and the first confirmed afterglow of an SGRB localized by the GUANO system on Swift. Our Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) detection of SGRB 211106A solidifies an origin in a faint host galaxy detected in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging at a projected separation of 0.8 kpc. The millimeter-band light curve captures the passage of the synchrotron peak from the afterglow forward shock, constraining the afterglow kinetic energy, log(EK,iso/erg)=53.2+-0.3 and density, log(n0/cm-3)=−0.6pm0.2 at a presumed redshift of z=1. We identify a jet break at tjet=29.2+4.5-4.0 days in the millimeter-band data and infer an opening angle of θjet=(15.5pm1.4) degrees and beaming-corrected kinetic energy of log(EK/erg)=54.3pm0.3, which are the widest and highest ever measured for an SGRB, respectively. From the lack of a detectable optical afterglow, coupled with the bright millimeter counterpart, we infer a high extinction, AV above 2.6 mag along the line of sight, making this the one of the most highly dust-extincted SGRBs known to date. Combining all published millimeter-band upper limits in conjunction with the energetics for a large sample of SGRBs, we find that energetic, wide-angled outflows in high density environments are more likely to have detectable millimeter counterparts. Concerted afterglow searches with ALMA should yield detection fractions of 24--40\% on timescales of 2 days at rates 0.8--1.6 per year, outpacing the historical discovery rate of SGRB centimeter-band afterglows.

title: GRB 201104A: A "repetitive" short gamma ray burst?
authors: Yun Wang, Lu-Yao Jiang, Jia Ren
topic: Gamma-ray bursts are divided into short gamma-ray bursts and long gamma-ray bursts based on the bimodal distribution of their durations. Long bursts and short bursts are typically characterized by different statistical characteristics. Nevertheless, there are some samples that challenge such a framework, such as GRB 060614, a long-duration burst with short burst characteristics. Furthermore, gamma-ray bursts are generally considered to be an event with no periodic or repetitive behavior, since the progenitors usually undergo destructive events, such as massive explosions or binary compact star mergers. In this work, we investigated Fermi data for possible quasi-periodic oscillations and repetitive behaviors of gamma-ray bursts using timing analysis methods and report a special event GRB 201104A, which is a long-duration burst with characteristics of a short burst, and it exhibits a "repetitive" behavior. We propose that such a situation may arise from lensed short gamma-ray bursts and attempt to verify it by Bayesian analysis. In addition, we extend the spectrum analysis to Bayesian inference. In spite of the existence of at least two distinct time periods with similar spectral distributions, there is no strong evidence that they result from a lensing gamma-ray burst. Taking the gravitational-lensing scenario out of consideration, a long burst would resemble a short burst in its repetitive behavior, which presents a challenge for the current classification scheme.

authors: Nissim Fraija, Antonio Galvan-Gamez, Boris Betancourt Kamenetskaia, Maria G. Dainotti, Simone Dichiara, P. Veres, Rosa L. Becerra, A. C. Caligula do E. S. Pedreira
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are fascinating extragalactic objects. They represent a fantastic opportunity to investigate unique properties not exhibited in other sources. Multi-wavelength afterglow observations from some short- and long-duration GRBs reveal an atypical long-lasting emission that evolves differently from the canonical afterglow light curves favoring the off-axis emission. We present an analytical synchrotron afterglow scenario, and the hydrodynamical evolution of an off-axis top-hat jet decelerated in a stratified surrounding environment. The analytical synchrotron afterglow model is shown during the coasting, deceleration (off- and on-axis emission), and the post-jet-break decay phases, and the hydrodynamical evolution is computed by numerical simulations showing the time evolution of the Doppler factor, the half-opening angle, the bulk Lorentz factor, and the deceleration radius. We show that numerical simulations are in good agreement with those derived with our analytical approach. We apply the current synchrotron model and describe successfully the delayed non-thermal emission observed in a sample of long and short GRBs with evidence of off-axis emission. Furthermore, we provide constraints on the possible afterglow emission by requiring the multi-wavelength upper limits derived for the closest Swift-detected GRBs and promising gravitational-wave events.

title: Mass loss of massive helium star supernova progenitors shortly before explosion constrained by supernova radio properties
authors: Takashi J. Moriya, Sung-Chul Yoon
topic: Mass loss of massive helium stars is not well understood even though it plays an essential role in determining their remnant neutron-star or black-hole masses as well as ejecta mass of Type Ibc supernovae. Radio emission from Type Ibc supernovae is strongly affected by circumstellar matter properties formed by mass loss of their massive helium star progenitors. In this study, we estimate the rise time and peak luminosity distributions of Type Ibc supernovae in radio based on a few massive helium star mass-loss prescriptions and compare them with the observed distribution to constrain the uncertain massive helium star mass-loss rates. We find that massive helium stars in the luminosity range expected for ordinary Type Ibc supernova progenitors (4.6 less log L/Lsun less 5.2) should generally have large mass-loss rates (above 1e-6 Msun/yr) in order to account for the observed rise time and peak luminosity distribution. Therefore, mass-loss prescriptions that predict significantly low mass-loss rates for helium stars in this luminosity range is inconsistent with the supernova radio observations. It is also possible that massive helium stars shortly before their explosion generally undergo mass-loss enhancement in a different way from the standard radiation-driven wind mechanism.

title: Kinetic Simulations of Instabilities and Particle Acceleration in Cylindrical Magnetized Relativistic Jets
authors: José Ortuño-Macías, Krzysztof Nalewajko, Dmitri A. Uzdensky, Mitchell C. Begelman, Gregory R. Werner, Alexander Y. Chen, Bhupendra Mishra
topic: Relativistic magnetized jets, such as those from AGN, GRBs and XRBs, are susceptible to current- and pressure-driven MHD instabilities that can lead to particle acceleration and non-thermal radiation. Here we investigate the development of these instabilities through 3D kinetic simulations of cylindrically symmetric equilibria involving toroidal magnetic fields with electron-positron pair plasma. Generalizing recent treatments by Alves et al. (2018) and Davelaar et al. (2020), we consider a range of initial structures in which the force due to toroidal magnetic field is balanced by a combination of forces due to axial magnetic field and gas pressure. We argue that the particle energy limit identified by Alves et al. (2018) is due to the finite duration of the fast magnetic dissipation phase. We find a rather minor role of electric fields parallel to the local magnetic fields in particle acceleration. In all investigated cases a kink mode arises in the central core region with a growth timescale consistent with the predictions of linearized MHD models. In the case of a gas-pressure-balanced (Z-pinch) profile, we identify a weak local pinch mode well outside the jet core. We argue that pressure-driven modes are important for relativistic jets, in regions where sufficient gas pressure is produced by other dissipation mechanisms.

title: The quasi-periodically oscillating precursor of a long gamma-ray burst from a binary neutron star merger
authors: Shuo Xiao, Yan-Qiu Zhang, Zi-Pei Zhu et al
topic: The milestone of GW 170817-GRB 170817A-AT 2017gfo has shown that gravitational wave (GW) is produced during the merger of neutron star-neutron star/black hole and that in electromagnetic (EM) wave a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and a kilonovae (KN) are generated in sequence after the merger. Observationally, however, EM property during a merger is still unclear. Here we report a peculiar precursor in a KN-associated long GRB 211211A. The duration of the precursor is 0.2 s, and the waiting time between the precursor and the main emission (ME) of the burst is 1 s, which is about the same as the time interval between GW 170817 and GRB 170817A. Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPO) with frequency 22 Hz (at 5sigma significance) are found throughout the precursor, the first detection of periodic signals from any {\it bona fide} GRBs. This indicates most likely that a magnetar participated in the merger, and the precursor might be produced due to a catastrophic flare accompanying with torsional or crustal oscillations of the magnetar. The strong seed magnetic field of 1014-15 G at the surface of the magnetar may also account for the prolonged duration of GRB 211211A. However, it is a challenge to reconcile the rather short lifetime of a magnetar \cite{kaspi2017magnetars} with the rather long spiraling time of a binary neutron star system only by gravitational wave radiation before merger.

title: Radio Spectral Energy Distributions for Single Massive Star Winds with Free-Free and Synchrotron Emission
authors: Christiana Erba, Richard Ignace
topic: The mass-loss rates from single massive stars are high enough to form radio photospheres at large distances from the stellar surface where the wind is optically thick to (thermal) free-free opacity. Here we calculate the far-infrared, millimeter, and radio band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that can result from the combination of free-free processes and synchrotron emission, to explore the conditions for non-thermal SEDs. Simplifying assumptions are adopted in terms of scaling relations for the magnetic field strength and the spatial distribution of relativistic electrons. The wind is assumed to be spherically symmetric, and we consider the effect of Razin suppression on the synchrotron emission. Under these conditions, long-wavelength SEDs with synchrotron emission can be either more steep or more shallow than the canonical asymptotic power-law SED from a non-magnetic wind. When non-thermal emission is present, the resultant SED shape is generally not a power-law; however, the variation in slope can change slowly with wavelength. Consequently, over a limited range of wavelengths, the SED can masquerade as approximately a power law. While most observed non-thermal long-wavelength spectra are associated with binarity, synchroton emission can have only a mild influence on single-star SEDs, requiring finer levels of wavelength sampling for detection of the effect.

title: Electromagnetic Follow-ups of Binary Neutron Star Mergers with Early Warnings from Decihertz Gravitational-wave Observatories
authors: Yacheng Kang, Chang Liu, Lijing Shao
topic: We investigate the prospects of electromagnetic follow-ups for binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, with the help of early warnings from decihertz gravitational-wave (GW) observatories, B-DECIGO and DO-Optimal. Extending our previous work in Liu et al. (2022), we not only give quick assessments of joint short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) detection rates for different gamma-ray satellites and BNS population models, but also elaborate on the analyses and results on multi-band kilonova detections for survey telescopes with different limiting magnitudes. During an assumed 4-year mission time for decihertz GW observatories, we find that for the goals of electromagnetic follow-ups, DO-Optimal performs better than B-DECIGO as a whole on the detection rate, and has a larger detectable distance for joint sGRB/kilonova searches. Taking the log-normal population model for BNS mergers and a one-day early-warning time as an example, we discuss the accuracy in localization and timing, as well as the redshift distributions for various synergy observations with electromagnetic facilities and decihertz GW detectors. Based on our analyses, we propose a feasible "wait-for" pattern as a novel detecting mode for future multi-messenger astrophysics.

title: Observational manifestations of jet-ejecta interaction from 3D GRMHD simulations of binary neutron star merger aftermath
authors: Ore Gottlieb, Serena Moseley, Teresita Ramirez-Aguilar, Ariadna Murguia-Berthier, Matthew Liska, Alexander Tchekhovskoy
topic: Short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) jets form in the aftermath of a neutron star merger, drill through disk winds and dynamical ejecta, and extend over 5 orders of magnitude in distance before reaching the photosphere. We present the first 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic sGRB simulations to span this enormous scale separation. They feature three possible outcomes: jet+cocoon, cocoon, and neither. Typical sGRB jets break out of the dynamical ejecta if: (i) the bound ejecta isotropic equivalent mass along the pole at the time of the BH formation is less 10-4 Msun, setting a limit on the delay time between the merger and BH formation, otherwise the jets perish inside the ejecta and leave the jet-inflated cocoon to power a low-luminosity sGRB; and (ii) post-merger remnant disk contains strong large-scale vertical magnetic field, above 1015 G; and (iii) if the jets are weak (less 1050 erg), the ejecta isotropic equivalent mass along the pole must be small (less 10-2 Msun). Generally, the jet structure is shaped by the early interaction with disk winds rather than the dynamical ejecta. As long as our jets break out of the ejecta, they reach the photosphere at at 1010.5 cm while retaining significant magnetization (of 1), suggesting that magnetic reconnection is a fundamental property of sGRB emission. The angular structure of the outflow isotropic equivalent energy after breakout consistently features a flat core followed by a steep power-law distribution (slope 3), similar to hydrodynamic jets. In the cocoon-only outcome, the dynamical ejecta broadens the outflow angular distribution and flattens it (slope 1.5).

title: Determining the equation of state of neutron stars with Einstein Telescope using tidal effects and r-mode excitations from a population of binary inspirals
authors: Pawan Kumar Gupta, Anna Puecher, Peter T.H. Pang, Justin Janquart, Gideon Koekoek, Chris Van Den Broeck
topic: Third-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) will be ideal instruments to probe the structure of neutron stars through the GWs they emit when undergoing binary coalescence. In this work we make predictions about how well ET in particular will enable us to reconstruct the neutron star equation of state through observations of tens of binary neutron star coalescences with signal-to-noise ratios in the hundreds. We restrict ourselves to information that can be extracted from the inspiral, which includes tidal effects and possibly r-mode resonances. In treating the latter we go beyond the Newtonian approximation, introducing and utilizing new universal relations. We find that the ability to observe resonant r-modes would have a noticeable impact on neutron star equation of state measurements with ET.

title: Bayesian Inference of Phenomenologycal EoS of Neutron Stars with Recent Observations
authors: Emanuel V. Chimanski, Ronaldo V. Lobato, Andre R. Goncalves, Carlos A. Bertulani
topic: The description of stellar interiors remains as a big challenge for the nuclear astrophysics community. The consolidated knowledge is restricted to density regions around the saturation of hadronic matter, regimes where our nuclear models are successfully applied. As one moves towards higher densities and extreme conditions up to five to twenty times rho0, little can be said about the microphysics of such objects. Here, we employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) strategy in order to access the variability of polytropic three-pircewised models for neutron star equation of states. With a fixed description of the hadronic matter, we explore a variety of models for the high density regimes leading to stellar masses up to 2.5 Msun. In addition, we also discuss the use of a Bayesian power regression model with heteroscedastic error. The set of EoS from LIGO was used as inputs and treated as data set for testing case.

title: Relativistic magnetic explosions
authors: Maxim V. Barkov, Praveen Sharma, Konstantinos N. Gourgouliatos, Maxim Lyutikov
topic: Many explosive astrophysical events, like magnetars' bursts and flares, are magnetically driven. We consider dynamics of such magnetic explosions - relativistic expansion of highly magnetized and highly magnetically over-pressurized clouds. The corresponding dynamics is qualitatively different from fluid explosions due to the topological constraint of the conservation of the magnetic flux. Using analytical, relativistic MHD as well as force-free calculations, we find that the creation of a relativistically expanding, causally disconnected flow obeys a threshold condition: it requires sufficiently high initial over-pressure and sufficiently quick decrease of the pressure in the external medium (the pre-explosion wind). In the subcritical case the magnetic cloud just "puffs-up" and quietly expands with the pre-flare wind. We also find a compact analytical solution to the Prendergast's problem - expansion of force-free plasma into vacuum.

authors: J. Keller, K. Hebeler, A. Schwenk
topic: We calculate the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter at finite temperature based on chiral effective field theory interactions to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order. Our results assess the theoretical uncertainties from the many-body calculation and the chiral expansion. Using a Gaussian process emulator for the free energy, we derive the thermodynamic properties of matter through consistent derivatives and use the Gaussian process to access arbitrary proton fraction and temperature. This enables a first nonparametric calculation of the equation of state in beta equilibrium, and of the speed of sound and the symmetry energy at finite temperature. Moreover, our results show that the thermal part of the pressure decreases with increasing densities.

title: Radioactively-Powered Gamma-Ray Transient Associated with a Kilonova from Neutron Star Merger
authors: Meng-Hua Chen, Rui-Chong Hu, En-Wei Liang
topic: Association of GW170817/GRB170817A/AT2017gfo provides the first direct evidence for neutron star mergers as significant sources of r-process nucleosynthesis. A gamma-ray transient (GRT) would be powered by the radioactive decay of the freshly-synthesized r-process elements. By analyzing the composition and gamma-ray opacity of the kilonova ejecta in details, we calculate the lightcurve and spectrum of the GRT for a spherically symmetric merger ejecta with mass Mej=0.001-0.05M and expansion velocity vej=0.1-0.4c. It is found that the peak of the GRT lightcurve depends on Mej and vej as tpk=0.9 days (Mej/0.01M)1/2(vej/0.2c)-1 and Lpk=7.0x1040 erg s-1(Mej/0.01M)1/2(vej/0.2c). Most radiating photons are in the 100−3000 keV band and the spectrum peaks at round 800 keV for different nuclear physics inputs. The line features are blurred out by the Doppler broadening effect and the uncertainties of nuclear physics data. Adopting the ejecta parameters reported in literature, we examine the detection probability of the possible GRT associated with AT2017gfo. We show that the GRT cannot be convincingly detected with the proposed missions in the MeV band, such as ETCC and AMEGO. The low gamma-ray flux, together with the extremely low event rate at local universe, makes a great challenge for discovery of the GRTs.

title: A semi-analytical solution to the forward-reverse shock hydrodynamics of the gamma-ray burst afterglow
authors: Ze-Lin Zhang, Ruo-Yu Liu, Jin-Jun Geng, Xue-Feng Wu, Xiang-Yu Wang
topic: We extend the standard model of forward-reverse shock (FS-RS) for gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow to more general cases. On one hand, we derive the analytical solution to the hydrodynamics of the shocks in two limiting cases, i.e., an ultra-relativistic reverse shock case and a Newtonian reverse shock case. Based on the asymptotic solutions in these two limiting cases, we constitute a semi-analytical solution for the hydrodynamics of the shocks in the generic case, covering the mildly-relativistic reverse shock case. On the other hand, we derive the evolution of the system taking into account the condition of energy conservation which is not satisfied in the standard FS-RS model. A generic solution of semi-analytical expressions is also given. In both the extended standard FS-RS model (satisfying pressure balance condition) and the model satisfying energy conservation, we find that the results in the ultra-relativistic reverse shock case and in the early stage of the Newtonian reverse shock case are different from those in the standard FS-RS model by only a factor that close to one while the same initial conditions adopted. However, the asymptotic solutions in the limiting cases are not good approximations to those in the intermediate case. Our semi-analytical results agree well with the numerical results for a large range of model parameters, and hence can be easily employed to diagnose the physical quantities of the GRB shell and circumburst environment.

title: A peculiarly long-duration gamma-ray burst from binary neutron star merger
authors: Jun Yang, Bin-Bin Zhang, Shunke Ai, Zi-Ke Liu, Xiangyu Ivy Wang, Ye Li, Hou-Jun Lü, Bing Zhang
topic: Some recent findings have shown that the duration of gamma-ray burst (GRB), although crucially related to the GRB central engine time scale, is not determinative in inferring the GRB origins in terms of their progenitors. In this paper, we report a peculiarly long-duration gamma-ray burst, GRB 211211A, that is associated with a kilonova in optical and near-infrared bands and is therefore likely the result of a binary neutron star merger. The burst broadly resembles the properties of GRB 060614 but with a much higher brightness in its light curve and harder spectra in both the main and extended emission phases, making it difficult to be explained as a short GRB with soft extended emission. Such a genuinely long-duration GRB suggests that merger product is likely a magnetar, which powers up the burst through magnetic and rotation energy for at least ∼70 seconds.

topic: The joint detection of GW170817 and GRB 170817A opened the era of multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves (GWs) and provided the first direct probe that at least some binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (S-GRBs). In the next years, we expect to have more multi-messenger detections of BNS mergers, thanks to the increasing sensitivity of GW detectors. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the prospects for joint GW and electromagnetic observations of merging BNSs in the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run with \emph{Fermi}, \emph{Swift}, INTEGRAL and SVOM. This work combines accurate population synthesis models with simulations of the expected GW signals and the associated S-GRBs, considering different assumptions about the GRB jet structure. We show that the expected rate of joint GW and electromagnetic detections could be up to ∼ 6 yr−1 when \emph{Fermi}/GBM is considered. Future joint observations will help us to better constrain the association between BNS mergers and S-GRBs, as well as the geometry of the GRB jets.

title: Black hole to photosphere: 3D GRMHD simulations of collapsars reveal wobbling and hybrid composition jets
authors: Ore Gottlieb, Matthew Liska, Alexander Tchekhovskoy, Omer Bromberg, Aretaios Lalakos, Dimitrios Giannios, Philipp Mösta
topic: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) accompany the collapse of massive stars and carry important information about the central engine. However, no 3D models have been able to follow these jets from their birth by a rotating black-hole (BH) to the photosphere. We present the first such 3D general-relativity magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which span over 6 orders of magnitude in space and time. The collapsing stellar envelope forms an accretion disk, which drags inward the magnetic flux that accumulates around the BH, becomes dynamically-important and launches bipolar jets. The jets reach the photosphere at 1012 cm with an opening angle, 6 and a Lorentz factor, less 30, unbind 90\% of the star and leave the BH mass essentially unchanged after the initial core-collapse. We find that: (i) The disk-jet system spontaneously develops misalignment relative to the BH rotational axis. As a result, the jet direction wobbles with an angle 12deg, which can naturally explain quiescent times in GRB lightcurves. The effective opening angle for detection θj+θt suggests that the intrinsic (beaming-corrected) GRB rate is lower by an order of magnitude than standard estimates. This implies that successful GRBs can be much rarer than currently thought, and emerge in only ∼0.1% of supernovae Ib/c. A possible explanation is that jets are either not launched or choked inside most supernova Ib/c progenitors. (ii) The magnetic energy in the jet decreases due to dissipation and mixing with the stellar material, resulting in jets with a hybrid composition of magnetic and thermal components at the photosphere, where 20\% of the gas maintains magnetization  above 0.1. This indicates that both a photospheric component and magnetic reconnection play a role in the GRB prompt emission.

title: Ab-initio QCD calculations impact the inference of the neutron-star-matter equation of state
authors: Tyler Gorda, Oleg Komoltsev, Aleksi Kurkela
topic: We demonstrate that ab-initio calculations in QCD at high densities offer significant and nontrivial information about the equation of state of matter in the cores of neutron stars, going beyond that which is obtainable from current astrophysical observations. We do so by extrapolating the equation of state to neutron-star densities using a Gaussian process and conditioning it sequentially with astrophysical observations and QCD input. Using our recent work, imposing the latter does not require an extrapolation to asymptotically high density. We find the QCD input to be complementary to the astrophysical observations, offering strong additional constraints at the highest densities reached in the cores of neutron stars; with the QCD input, the equation of state is no longer prior dominated at any density. The QCD input reduces the pressure and speed of sound at high densities, and it predicts that binary collisions of equal-mass neutron stars will produce a black hole with greater than 95\% (68\%) credence for masses M above 1.38Msun (M above 1.25Msun). We provide a Python implementation of the QCD likelihood function so that it can be conveniently used within other inference setups.

title: GRMHD simulations of accreting neutron stars I: nonrotating dipoles
authors: Sercan Çıkıntoğlu, K. Yavuz Ekşi, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: We study the general-relativistic dynamics of matter being accreted onto and ejected by a magnetised and nonrotating neutron star. The dynamics is followed in the framework of fully general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) within the ideal-MHD limit and in two spatial dimensions. More specifically, making use of the numerical code BHAC, we follow the evolution of a geometrically thick matter torus driven into accretion by the development of a magnetorotational instability. By making use of a number of simulations in which we vary the strength of the stellar dipolar magnetic field, we can determine self-consistently the location of the magnetospheric (or Alfvén) radius rmsph and study how it depends on the magnetic moment  and on the accretion rate. Overall, we recover the analytic Newtonian scaling relation, i.e. rmsph - B4/7, but also find that the dependence on the accretion rate is very weak. Furthermore, we find that the material torque correlates linearly with the mass-accretion rate, although both of them exhibit rapid fluctuations. Interestingly, the total torque fluctuates drastically in strong magnetic field simulations and these unsteady torques observed in the simulations could be associated with the spin fluctuations observed in X-ray pulsars.

title: Simulating bulk viscosity in neutron stars II: evolution in spherical symmetry
authors: Giovanni Camelio, Lorenzo Gavassino, Marco Antonelli, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Brynmor Haskell
topic: Out-of-equilibrium reactions between different particle species are the main process contributing to bulk viscosity in neutron stars. In this work, we numerically compare three different approaches to the modeling of bulk viscosity: the multi-component fluid with reacting particle species and two bulk stress formalism based on the Müller-Israel-Stewart theory, namely the Hiscock-Lindblom and the Maxwell-Cattaneo models, whose flux-conservative formulation in radial gauge-polar slicing coordinates and spherical symmetry is derived in a companion paper. In our knowledge, this is the first time that a neutron star is simulated with the complete Hiscock-Lindblom model of bulk viscosity. We find that the Hiscock-Lindblom and Maxwell-Cattaneo models are good approximations of the multi-component fluid for small perturbations and when the non-equilibrium equation of state of the fluid depends on only one independent particle fraction. For more than one independent particle fraction and for large perturbations, the bulk stress approximation is still valid but less accurate. In addition, we include the energy loss due to the luminosity of the reactions in the bulk stress formulation. We find that the energy loss due to bulk viscosity has a larger effect on the dynamics than the bulk stress or the variation in particle composition per se. The new one-dimensional, general-relativistic hydrodynamic code developed for this work, hydro-bulk-1D, is publicly available.

title: Simulating bulk viscosity in neutron stars I: formalism 
authors: Giovanni Camelio, Lorenzo Gavassino, Marco Antonelli, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Brynmor Haskell
topic: The faithful inclusion of the effects of bulk viscosity induced by the presence of chemical reactions is an important issue for simulations of core-collapse supernovae, binary neutron star mergers and neutron star oscillations, where particle abundances are locally pushed out of chemical equilibrium by rarefaction and compression of the fluid elements. In this work, we discuss three different approaches that can be used to implement bulk viscosity in general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of neutron stars: the exact multi-component reacting fluid, and two Müller-Israel-Stewart theories, namely the second order Hiscock-Lindblom model and its linear limit, the Maxwell-Cattaneo model. After discussing the theory behind the three approaches, we specialize their dynamics equations to spherical symmetry in the radial gauge-polar slicing (i.e., Schwarzschild) coordinates. We also discuss a particular choice for the equation of state of the fluid and the associated neutrino emission rates, which are used in a companion paper for the numerical comparison of the three frameworks, and we obtain the effective sound speed for the Hiscock-Lindblom theory in the non-linear regime.

title: Pre-acceleration in the Electron Foreshock I: Electron Acoustic Waves
authors: Paul J. Morris, Artem Bohdan, Martin S. Weidl, Martin Pohl
topic: To undergo diffusive shock acceleration, electrons need to be pre-accelerated to increase their energies by several orders of magnitude, else their gyro-radii are smaller than the finite width of the shock. In oblique shocks, where the upstream magnetic field orientation is neither parallel or perpendicular to the shock normal, electrons can escape to the shock upstream, modifying the shock foot to a region called the electron foreshock. To determine the pre-acceleration in this region, we undertake PIC simulations of oblique shocks while varying the obliquity and in-plane angles. We show that while the proportion of reflected electrons is negligible for [], it increases to R 5\% for 30deg, and that, via the electron acoustic instability, these electrons power electrostatic waves upstream with energy density proportional to R0.6 and a wavelength 2Lambda se, where Lambda se is the electron skin length. While the initial reflection mechanism is typically a combination of shock surfing acceleration and magnetic mirroring, we show that once the electrostatic waves have been generated upstream they themselves can increase the momenta of upstream electrons parallel to the magnetic field. In 1\% of cases, upstream electrons are prematurely turned away from the shock and never injected downstream. In contrast, a similar fraction are re-scattered back towards the shock after reflection, re-interact with the shock with energies much greater than thermal, and cross into the downstream.

topic: We propose a simple analytical jet model of magnetic jets, utilizing conservation laws and some results of published GRMHD jet simulations, and consider radially-averaged profiles of the physical quantities. We take into account conversion of the magnetic energy flux to bulk acceleration in jets formed around rotating black holes assuming the mass continuity equation and constant jet power, leading to the Bernoulli equation. For assumed profiles of the bulk Lorentz factor and the radius, this gives the profile of toroidal magnetic field component along the jet. We then consider the case where the poloidal field component is connected to a rotating black hole surrounded by an accretion disc. The formalism recovers the standard formula for the power extracted from a rotating black hole. We find that the poloidal field strength dominates over the toroidal one in the comoving frame up to large distances, which means that jets should be more stable to current-driven kink modes. The resulting magnetic field profiles can then be used to calculate the jet synchrotron emission.

title: The effects of a magnetar engine on the gamma-ray burst-associated supernovae: Application to double-peaked SN 2006aj
authors: Zhen-Dong Zhang, Yun-Wei Yu, Liang-Duan Liu
topic: A millisecond magnetar engine has been widely suggested to exist in gamma-ray burst (GRB) phenomena, in view of its substantial influences on the GRB afterglow emission. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the magnetar engine on the supernova (SN) emission which is associated with long GRBs and, specifically, confront the model with the observational data of SN 2006aj/GRB 060218. SN 2006aj is featured by its remarkable double-peaked ultraviolet-optical (UV-opt) light curves. By fitting these light curves, we demonstrate that the first peak can be well accounted for by the breakout emission of the shock driven by the magnetar wind, while the primary supernova emission is also partly powered by the energy injection from the magnetar. The magnetic field strength of the magnetar is constrained to be 1015 G, which is in good agreement with the common results inferred from the afterglow emission of long GRBs. In more detail, it is further suggested that the UV excess in the late emission of the supernova could also be due to the leakage of the non-thermal emission of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN), if some special conditions can be satisfied. The consistency between the model and the SN 2006aj observation indicates that the magnetar engine is likely to be ubiquitous in the GRB phenomena and even further intensify their connection with the phenomena of superluminous supernovae.

topic: Here, we report the discovery of a kilonova associated with the nearby (350 Mpc) minute-duration GRB 211211A. In tandem with deep optical limits that rule out the presence of an accompanying supernova to MI above -13 mag at 17.7 days post-burst, the identification of a kilonova confirms that this burst's progenitor was a compact object merger. While the spectrally softer tail in GRB 211211A's gamma-ray light curve is reminiscent of previous extended emission short GRBs (EE-SGRBs), its prompt, bright spikes last above 12 s, separating it from past EE-SGRBs. GRB 211211A's kilonova has a similar luminosity, duration and color to AT2017gfo, the kilonova found in association with the gravitational wave (GW)-detected binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817. We find that the merger ejected 0.04Msun of r-process-rich material, and is consistent with the merger of two neutron stars (NSs) with masses close to the canonical 1.4Msun This discovery implies that GRBs with long, complex light curves can be spawned from compact object merger events and that a population of kilonovae following GRBs with durations above 2 s should be accounted for in calculations of the NS merger r-process contribution and rate. At 350 Mpc, the current network of GW interferometers at design sensitivity would have detected the merger precipitating GRB 211211A, had it been operating at the time of the event. Further searches for GW signals coincident with long GRBs are therefore a promising route for future multi-messenger astronomy.

title: Multi-scale VLBI observations of the candidate host galaxy of GRB 200716C
authors: S. Giarratana, M. Giroletti, C. Spingola, G. Migliori, S. Belladitta, M. Pedani
topic: In this Letter we present the analysis of multi-band public data and high sensitivity EVN and e-MERLIN follow-up observations of the candidate host galaxy of GRB 200716C, namely J1304+2938. GRB 200716C is a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB), which surprisingly lies among the short-duration GRBs in the Eiso-Ep,z Amati relation. Because of this property and the presence of two peaks in the gamma-ray light curve, it has been recently suggested that GRB 200716C might be a short-GRB gravitationally lensed by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) hosted by J1304+2938 at z = 0.341. While no detections of the afterglow have been reported in radio hitherto, we present here the discovery of significant emission in survey data between 130 MHz and 3 GHz, together with the results of deep, dedicated high-angular-resolution observations carried out with EVN+e-MERLIN, which do not reveal any significant emission down to the 10 uJy beam-1 level. We associate the radio emission to J1304+2938, and we derive a luminosity larger than (2.9pm0.4) x 1030 erg s-1 Hz-1: if GRB 200716C belongs to J1304+2938, the latter would be one of the brightest host galaxy detected so far in the radio. As a matter of fact, altogether the properties of J1304+2938 are consistent with a highly star forming galaxy (SFR above 186 Msun yr-1), which is the typical environment expected for long-GRBs. Conversely, neither the public data nor our VLBI observations can confirm or rule out the presence of an IMBH acting as a (milli-)lens, and thus the nature of the burst still remains unknown.

title: A novel formulation for the evolution of relativistic rotating stars
authors: Hirotada Okawa, Kotaro Fujisawa, Nobutoshi Yasutake, Misa Ogata, Yu Yamamoto, Shoichi Yamada
topic: We present a new formulation to construct numerically equilibrium configurations of rotating stars in general relativity. Having in mind the application to their quasi static evolutions, we adopt a Lagrangian formulation of our own devising, in which we solve force balance equations to seek for the positions of fluid elements assigned to the grid points, instead of the ordinary Eulerian formulation. Unlike previous works in the literature, we do not employ the first integral of the Euler equation, which is not obtained by an analytic integration in general. We assign a mass, specific angular momentum and entropy to each fluid element in contrast to the previous methods, in which the spatial distribution of the angular velocity or angular momentum is specified. Those distributions are determined after the positions of all fluid elements (or grid points) are derived in our formulation. We solve the large system of algebraic nonlinear equations that are obtained by discretizing the time-independent Euler and Einstein equations in the finite-elements method by using our new multi-dimensional root-finding scheme, named the W4 method. To demonstrate the capability of our new formulation, we construct some rotational configurations both barotropic and baroclinic. We also solve three evolutionary sequences that mimic the cooling, mass-loss, and mass-accretion as simple toy models.

topic: A significant fraction (30\%) of well-localized short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) lack a coincident host galaxy. This leads to two main scenarios: \textit{i}) that the progenitor system merged outside of the visible light of its host, or \textit{ii}) that the sGRB resided within a faint and distant galaxy that was not detected by follow-up observations. Discriminating between these scenarios has important implications for constraining the formation channels of neutron star mergers, the rate and environments of gravitational wave sources, and the production of heavy elements in the Universe. In this work, we present the results of our observing campaign targeted at 31 sGRBs that lack a putative host galaxy. Our study effectively doubles the sample of well-studied sGRB host galaxies, now totaling 72 events of which 28\% lack a coincident host galaxy to deep limits (r ablve 26 or F110W above 27 AB mag), and represents the largest homogeneously selected catalog of sGRB offsets to date. We find that 70\% of sub-arcsecond localized sGRBs occur within 10 kpc of their host's nucleus, with a median projected physical offset of 5.6 kpc. Using this larger population, we discover a redshift evolution in the locations of sGRBs: bursts at low-z occur at 2x larger offsets compared to those at z above 0.5. Furthermore, we find evidence for a sample of hostless sGRBs at z above 1 that are indicative of a larger high-z population, further constraining the sGRB redshift distribution and disfavoring log-normal delay time models.

title: Neutron star radii, deformabilities, and moments of inertia from experimental and ab initio theory constraints on the 208Pb neutron skin thickness
authors: Yeunhwan Lim, Jeremy W. Holt
topic: Recent experimental and ab initio theory investigations of the 208Pb neutron skin thickness are sufficiently precise to inform the neutron star equation of state. In particular, the strong correlation between the 208Pb neutron skin thickness and the pressure of neutron matter at normal nuclear densities leads to modified predictions for the radii, tidal deformabilities, and moments of inertia of typical 1.4 solar-mass neutron stars. In the present work, we study the relative impact of these recent analyses of the 208Pb neutron skin thickness on bulk properties of neutron stars within a Bayesian statistical analysis. Two models for the equation of state prior are employed in order to study the role of the highly uncertain high-density equation of state. From our combined Bayesian analysis of nuclear theory, nuclear experiment, and observational constraints on the dense matter equation of state, we find at the 90% credibility level R1.4=12.36+0.38-0.73 km for the radius of a 1.4 solar-mass neutron star, R2.0=11.96+0.94-0.71 km for the radius of a 2.0 solar-mass neutron star, Λ1.4=440+103-144 for the tidal deformability of a 1.4 solar-mass neutron star, and I1.338=1.425+0.074-0.146x1045gcm2 for the moment of inertia of PSR J0737-3039A whose mass is 1.338 solar masses.

title: Constraining the equation of state of neutron stars using multimessenger observations
authors: Bhaskar Biswas
topic: Neutron stars are the densest objects known in our visible universe. Properties of matter inside a neutron star are encoded in its equation of state, which has wide-ranging uncertainty from a theoretical perspective. With the current understanding of quantum chromodynamics, it is hard to determine the interactions of neutron star matter at such high densities. Also performing many body calculations is computationally intractable. Besides the constitution of the neutron star core is highly speculative -- it is not ruled out that it contains exotic matter like strange baryons, meson condensates, quark matter, etc. Although the matter inside the neutron star is extremely dense, but the temperature of this object is very cold in most of its life span. We cannot produce such dense but rather cold material in our laboratory. Since probing the physics of neutron star matter is inaccessible by our earth based experiments, we look for astrophysical observations of neutron stars. This thesis deals with the theoretical and computational techniques required to translate neutron star observables from astrophysical observations to its equation of state.

title: On energetics and progenitors of Odd Radio Circles
authors: A. Omar 
topic: Odd Radio Circles or ORCs are recently discovered low surface brightness diffuse radio sources, whose progenitors and astrophysical processes responsible for their origins are presently debated. Some ORCs appear to be hosted in distant galaxies and some are host-less. Two plausible scenarios consider ORCs as either nearby supernovae remnants of sizes a few hundred pc in the intragroup medium of the local group of galaxies or alternatively shocked halos of sizes a few hundred kpc around distant galaxies. The input energy for shocks, required to create ORCs of a few hundred kpc size is estimated to be 1056−1059 erg. It is shown here that the energy released in shocks with a rate of 1041−1044 erg s-1 due to multiple (103−106) tidal disruption events in a short span of time (a few tens of Myr) in a merger galaxy system, hosting a massive black hole can supply required energy to generate ORCs around distant galaxies. The most plausible and abundant hosts for ORCs can be post-starburst galaxies at intermediate redshifts. The presently observed dominance of tidal disruption events in post-starburst galaxies, redshift evolution and environments of post-starburst galaxies at intermediate redshifts favourably support the current observations.

title: On the nature of Fast Blue Optical Transients
authors: Maxim Lyutikov 
topic: Short rise times of Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs) require very light ejected envelopes, Mej 10- 1Msun, much smaller than of a typical supernova. Short peak times also mean that FBOTs should be hydrodynamically, not radioactively powered. The detection by Chandra of X-ray emission in AT2020mrf of LX 1042 erg s-1 after 328 days implies total, overall dominant, X-ray energetics at the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) level of 6x1049 erg. We further develop a model of Lyutikov & Toonen (2019), whereby FBOTs are the results of a late accretion induced collapse (AIC) of the product of super-Chandrasekhar double white dwarf (WD) merger between ONeMg WD and another WD. Small ejecta mass, and the rarity of FBOTs, result from the competition between mass loss from the merger product to the wind, and ashes added to the core, on time scale of 103−104 years. FBOTs occur only when the envelope mass before AIC is 10-1Msun. FBOTs proper come from central engine-powered radiation-dominated forward shock as it propagates through ejecta. FBOTs' duration is determined by the diffusion time of photons produced by the NS-driven forward shock within the expanding ejecta. All the photons produced by the central source deep inside the ejecta escape almost simultaneously, producing a short bright event. The high energy emission is generated at the highly relativistic and highly magnetized termination shock, qualitatively similar to Pulsar Wind Nebulae. The X-ray bump observed in AT2020mrf by SRG/eROSITA, predicted by Lyutikov & Toonen (2019), is coming from the break-out of the engine-powered shock from the ejecta into the preceding wind. The model requires total energetics of just few x1050 ergs, slightly above the observed X-rays. We predict that the system is hydrogen poor.

title: Time dependent numerical model for the very high energy emissions of distant gamma-ray busrt GRB 201216C
authors: Yan Huang
topic: Recently, the MAGIC Collaboration reported a 5sigma statistical significance of the very-high-energy (VHE) emission from a distant GRB, GRB 201216C. Such distant GRB may be effectively absorbed by the extragalactic background light (EBL). The origin of the VHE emission from such distant objects is still unknown. Here, we propose a numerical model for studying the afterglow emission of this distant GRB. The model solves the continuity equation governing the temporal evolution of electron distribution, and the broad-band observed data can be explained by the synchrotron plus synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation of the forward shock. The predicted observed 0.1 TeV flux can reach 109-1010erg cm-2 s-1 at t 103-104s, even with strong EBL absorption, such strong Sub-TeV emissions still can be observed by MAGIC telescope. Using this numerical model, the shock parameters in the modeling are similar with two other Sub-TeV GRBs (i.e., GRB 190114C and GRB 180720B), implying that the Sub-TeV GRBs have some commonalities: they have energetic burst energy, low circum-burst medium density and low magnetic equipartition factor. We regard GRB 201216C as a typical GRB, and estimate the maximum redshift of GRB that can be detected by MAGIC telescope, i.e., z 1.6. We also find that the VHE photon energy of such distant GRB can only reach 0.1 TeV. Improving the low energy sensitivity of the VHE telescope is very important to detect the Sub-TeV emissions of these distant GRBs.

title: Interaction of a Relativistic Magnetized Collisionless Shock with a Dense Clump
authors: Sara Tomita, Yutaka Ohira, Shigeo, S. Kimura, Kengo Tomida, Kenji Toma
topic: The interactions between a relativistic magnetized collisionless shock and dense clumps have been expected to play a crucial role on the magnetic field amplification and cosmic-ray acceleration. We investigate this process by two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations for the first time, where the clump size is much larger than the gyroradius of downstream particles. We also perform relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for the same condition to see the kinetic effects. We find that particles escape from the shocked clump along magnetic field lines in the PIC simulations, so that the vorticity is lower than that in the MHD simulations. Moreover, in both the PIC and MHD simulations, the shocked clump quickly decelerates because of the Lorentz contraction. Owing to the escape and the deceleration, the shocked clump cannot amplify the downstream magnetic field in relativistic collisionless shocks. This large-scale PIC simulation opens a new window to understand large-scale behaviors in collisionless plasma systems.

Setiadi, Yuhan Yao
topic: We present results from extensive broadband follow-up of GRB 210204A over the period of thirty days. We detect optical flares in the afterglow at 7.6 x 10^5 s and 1.1 x 10^6 s after the burst: the most delayed flaring ever detected in a GRB afterglow. At the source redshift of 0.876, the rest-frame delay is 5.8 x 10^5 s (6.71 d). We investigate possible causes for this flaring and conclude that the most likely cause is a refreshed shock in the jet. The prompt emission of the GRB is within the range of typical long bursts: it shows three disjoint emission episodes, which all follow the typical GRB correlations. This suggests that GRB 210204A might not have any special properties that caused late-time flaring, and the lack of such detections for other afterglows might be resulting from the paucity of late-time observations. Systematic late-time follow-up of a larger sample of GRBs can shed more light on such afterglow behaviour. Further analysis of the GRB 210204A shows that the late time bump in the light curve is highly unlikely due to underlying SNe at redshift (z) = 0.876 and is more likely due to the late time flaring activity. The cause of this variability is not clearly quantifiable due to the lack of multi-band data at late time constraints by the bad weather conditions. The flare of GRB 210204A is the latest flare detected to date.

title: Constraining nucleosynthesis in neutrino-driven winds: observations, simulations and nuclear physics
authors: A. Psaltis, A. Arcones, F. Montes, P. Mohr, C.J. Hansen, M. Jacobi, H. Schatz
topic: A promising astrophysical site to produce the lighter heavy elements of the first r-process peak (Z=38-47) is the moderately neutron rich [0.4\less Ye \less 0.5] neutrino-driven ejecta of explosive environments, such as core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, where the weak r-process operates. This nucleosynthesis exhibits uncertainties from the absence of experimental data from reactions on neutron-rich nuclei, which are currently based on statistical model estimates. In this work, we report on a new study of the nuclear reaction impact using a Monte Carlo approach and improved [] rates based on the Atomki-V2 Optical Model Potential (OMP). We compare our results with observations from an up-to-date list of metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] \less -1.5 to find conditions of the neutrino-driven wind where the lighter heavy elements can be synthesized. We identified a list of [] reaction rates that affect key elemental ratios in different astrophysical conditions. Our study aims on motivating more nuclear physics experiments on [] reactions using current and the new generation of radioactive beam facilities and also more observational studies of metal-poor stars.

title: Opacity of the highly ionized lanthanides and the effect on the early kilonova
authors: Smaranika Banerjee, Masaomi Tanaka, Daiji Kato, Gediminas Gaigalas, Kyohei Kawaguchi, Nanae Domoto
topic: We investigate the effect of the presence of lanthanides (Z = 57- 71) on the kilonova at t hours after the neutron star merger for the first time. For this purpose, we calculate the atomic structures and the opacities for selected lanthanides: Nd (Z = 60), Sm (Z = 62), and Eu (Z = 63). We consider the ionization degree up to tenth (XI), applicable for the ejecta at t  a few hours after the merger, when the temperature is T  10^5 K. We find that the opacities for the highly ionized lanthanides are exceptionally high, reaching kexp 1000 cm^2/g for Eu, thanks to the energy levels being highly dense. Using the new opacity, we perform radiative transfer simulations to show that the early light curves become fainter by a (maximum) factor of four, in comparison to lanthanide-free ejecta at t 0.1 day. However, the period at which the light curves are affected is relatively brief due to the rapid time evolution of the opacity in the outermost layer of the ejecta. We predict that for a source at a distance of 100 Mpc, UV brightness for lanthanide-rich ejecta shows a drop to 21-22 mag at t 0.1 day and the UV peaks around t0.2 day with a magnitude of 19 mag. Future detection of such a kilonova by the existing UV satellite like Swift or the upcoming UV satellite ULTRASAT will provide useful constraints on the abundance in the outer ejecta and the corresponding nucleosynthesis conditions in the neutron star mergers.

title: Long-term evolution of a supernova remnant hosting a double neutron star binary
authors: Tomoki Matsuoka, Shiu-Hang Lee, Keiichi Maeda, Tomoya Takiwaki, Takashi J. Moriya
topic: An ultra-stripped supernova (USSN) is a type of core-collapse SN explosion proposed to be a candidate formation site of a double neutron star (DNS) binary. We investigate the dynamical evolution of an ultra-stripped supernova remnant (USSNR), which should host a DNS at its center. By accounting for the mass-loss history of the progenitor binary using a model developed by a previous study, we construct the large-scale structure of the {circumstellar medium (CSM)} up to a radius 100pc, and simulate the explosion and subsequent evolution of a USSN surrounded by such a CSM environment. We find that the CSM encompasses an extended region characterized by a hot plasma with a temperature 108K located around the termination shock of the wind from the progenitor binary (10pc), and the USSNR blastwave is drastically weakened while penetrating through this hot plasma. Radio continuum emission from a young USSNR is sufficiently bright to be detectable if it inhabits our Galaxy but faint compared to the observed Galactic SNRs, and thereafter declines in luminosity through adiabatic cooling. Within our parameter space, USSNRs typically exhibit a low radio luminosity and surface brightness compared to the known Galactic SNRs. Due to the small event rate of USSNe and their relatively short observable lifespan, we calculate that USSNRs account for only 0.1-1 % of the total SNR population. This is consistent with the fact that no SNR hosting a DNS binary has been discovered in the Milky Way so far.

title: The electron foreshock at high-Mach-number nonrelativistic oblique shocks
authors: Artem Bohdan, Martin S. Weidl, Paul J. Morris, Martin Pohl
topic: In the Universe matter outside of stars and compact objects is mostly composed of collisionless plasma. The interaction of a supersonic plasma flow with an obstacle results in collisionless shocks that are often associated with intense nonthermal radiation and the production of cosmic ray particles. Motivated by simulations of non-relativistic high-Mach-number shocks in supernova remnants, we investigate the instabilities excited by relativistic electron beams in the extended foreshock of oblique shocks. The phase-space distributions in the inner and outer foreshock regions are derived with a Particle-in-Cell simulation of the shock and used as initial conditions for simulations with periodic boundary conditions to study their relaxation towards equilibrium. We find that the observed electron-beam instabilities agree very well with the predictions of a linear dispersion analysis: the electrostatic electron-acoustic instability dominates in the outer region of the foreshock, while the denser electron beams in the inner foreshock drive the gyroresonant oblique-whistler instability.

authors: L. Rhodes, A.J. van der Horst, R. Fender, D.R. Aguilera-Dena, J.S. Bright, S. Vergani, D.R.A. Williams
topic: We present the results of a radio observing campaign on GRB 201216C, combined with publicly available optical and X-ray data. The detection of very high energy (VHE, >100GeV) emission by MAGIC makes this the fifth VHE GRB at time of publication. Comparison between the optical and X-ray light curves show that GRB 201216C is a dark GRB, i.e. the optical emission is significantly absorbed and is fainter than expected from the X-ray detections. Our e-MERLIN data also shows evidence of diffractive interstellar scintillation. We can study the column density along the line-of-sight to the GRB in both the host galaxy, from the damped optical light curve, and the Milky Way, via scintillation studies. We find that the afterglow is best modelled using a jet-cocoon geometry within a stellar wind environment. Fitting the data with a multi-component model we estimate that the optical, X-ray and higher-frequency radio data before 25days originates from an ultra-relativistic jet with an isotropic equivalent kinetic energy of (0.6-10)x10^52erg and an opening angle of 1-9deg. The lower-frequency radio emission detected by MeerKAT, from day 28 onwards, is produced by the cocoon with a kinetic energy that is between two and seven orders of magnitude lower (0.02-50)x10to48erg. The energies of the two components are comparable to those derived in simulations of such scenarios.

topic: The advanced gravitational wave (GW) detector network has started {routine detection of } signals from merging compact binaries. Data indicate that in a fair fraction of these sources, at least one component was a neutron star, bringing with it the possibility of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. So far, a confirmed link between EM and GW radiation has been established for only one source, GW170817. Joint analysis of broadband multiwavelength data and the GW signal have yielded rich information spanning fields as varied as jet physics, cosmology, and nucleosynthesis. Here, we discuss the importance of such joint observations, as well as current and near-future efforts to discover and study more EM counterparts to GW sources.

title: Structure and pulse profiles of dark matter admixed neutron stars
authors: Zhiqiang Miao, Yaofeng Zhu, Ang Li, Feng Huang
topic: Neutron stars (NSs) could efficiently capture dark matter (DM) due to their extreme densities and are considered sensitive probes of the presence and the properties of DM. The distribution of the DM in DM-admixed NSs (DANSs) is supposed to be either a dense dark core or an extended dark halo, which is subject to the DM fraction of DANS (fχ) and the DM properties, such as the mass (mχ) and the strength of the self-interaction (y). In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the formation criterion for dark core/dark halo and point out that the relative distribution of these two components is essentially determined by the ratio of the central enthalpy of the DM component to that of the baryonic matter component inside DANSs. For the critical case where the radii of DM and baryonic matter are the same, we further derive an analytical formula to describe the dependence of fcritχ on mχ and y for given DANS mass. The relative distribution of the two components in DANSs can lead to different observational effects on NSs. We here focus on the modification of the pulsar pulse profile due to the extra light-bending effect in the case of a dark-halo existence and conduct the first investigation of the dark-halo effects on NS pulse profiles. We find that the peak flux deviation is strongly dependent on the ratio of the halo mass to the radius of the DM component. Lastly, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation on the DM particle properties based on the recent X-ray observations of PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer.

title: Numerical relativity simulations of the neutron star merger GW190425: microphysics and mass ratio effects
authors: A. Camilletti, L. Chiesa, G. Ricigliano, A. Perego, L. C. Lippold, S. Padamata, S. Bernuzzi, D. Radice, D. Logoteta, F. M. Guercilena
topic: GW190425 was the second gravitational wave (GW) signal compatible with a binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. Despite intense follow-up campaigns, no electromagnetic counterpart was identified. Whether the associated kilonova was too dim or the localisation area too broad is still an open question. We simulate 28 BNS mergers with the chirp mass of GW190425 and spanning a mass ratio 1 l q l 1.67, using numerical-relativity simulations with finite temperature, composition dependent nuclear equation of state (EOS) and neutrino radiation. The energy emitted in GWs is 0.083Msun c2 with a peak luminosity of 1.1-2.4x1058 erg s s1/(1+q)2. Dynamical ejecta and disc mass are relatively small, the former ranging between 5x10-6 and 10-3 Msun and the latter between 10-5 and 0.1 Msun. Asymmetric mergers, especially in the case of stiff EOS, are able to unbind more matter and to form heavier discs compared to equal mass binaries. The angular momentum of the disc is 8-10Msun G Mdisc/c over three orders of magnitude in Mdisc. While the associated nucleosynthesis shows no peculiarity, the simulated kilonovae are relatively dim compared with the GW170817 event. In particular, for distances compatible with GW190425, we find AB magnitudes always dimmer than 20 mag for the B, r and K bands, with brighter kilonovae associated to more asymmetric binaries and stiffer EOS. We suggest that, even assuming a good coverage of GW190425' sky location, the kilonova signal could hardly have been detected by present wide-field surveys and no firm constraints on the binary parameters or neutron star (NS) EOS can be argued from the lack of the detection.

title: Spectra of magnetic turbulence in a relativistic plasma
authors: Cristian Vega, Stanislav Boldyrev, Vadim Roytershteyn
topic: We present a phenomenological and numerical study of strong Alfvénic turbulence in a magnetically dominated collisionless relativistic plasma with a strong background magnetic field. In contrast with the non-relativistic case, the energy in such turbulence is contained in magnetic and electric fluctuations. We argue that such turbulence is analogous to turbulence in a strongly magnetized non-relativistic plasma in the regime of broken quasi-neutrality. Our 2D particle-in-cell numerical simulations of turbulence in a relativistic pair plasma find that the spectrum of the total energy has the scaling k-3/2, while the difference between the magnetic and electric energies, the so-called residual energy, has the scaling k-2.4. The electric and magnetic fluctuations at scale ℓ exhibit dynamic alignment with the alignment-angle scaling close to []. At scales smaller than the (relativistic) plasma inertial scale, the energy spectrum of relativistic inertial Alfvén turbulence steepens to k-.5.

title: Very High-energy Afterglow Emission of GRB 190829A: Evidence for Its Hadronic Origin?
authors: Sarira Sahu, Isabel Abigail Valadez Polanco, Subhash Rajpoot
topic: The detection of multi-TeV gamma-rays from the afterglow phase of GRB 190829A by High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescope is an addition to the already existing list of two more GRBs observed in the very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays in recent years. Jets of blazars and GRBs have many similarities and the photohadronic model is very successful in explaining the VHE gamma-ray spectra from the high energy blazars. Recently, the photohadronic model has been successfully applied to study the sub-TeV gamma-rays from the afterglow phases of GRB 180720B and GRB 190114C. We employed this model again to explain the VHE spectra observed for the two consecutive nights from GRB 190829A. We show that the spectra of GRB 190829A can be due to the interactions of high energy protons with the synchrotron self-Compton photons in the forward shock region of the GRB jet, similar to the low emission state of the VHE flaring events of high energy blazars. We speculate that, if in future, it is possible to observe the VHE gamma-ray spectra from nearby GRBs in their afterglow phases, then some of them could only be explained by employing two different spectral indices. If confirmed, such VHE spectra could be interpreted as a result of the interactions of the high energy protons with the photons, both from the synchrotron background and the synchrotron self-Compton background in the forward shock region.

title: Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Yun-Wei Yu, He Gao, Fa-Yin Wang, Bin-Bin Zhang
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are short and intense bursts of ∼100 keV−1MeV photons, usually followed by long-lasting decaying afterglow emission in a wide range of electromagnetic wavelengths from radio to X-ray and, sometimes, even to GeV gamma-rays. These emissions are believed to originate from a relativistic jet, which is driven due to the collapse of special massive stars and the mergers of compact binaries (i.e., double neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). This chapter first briefly introduces the basic observational facts of the GRB phenomena, including the prompt emission, afterglow emission, and host galaxies. Secondly, a general theoretical understanding of the GRB phenomena is described based on a relativistic jet's overall dynamical evolution, including the acceleration, propagation, internal dissipation, and deceleration phases. Here a long-lasting central engine of the GRBs can substantially influence the dynamical evolution of the jet. In addition, a supernova/kilonova emission can appear in the optical afterglow of some nearby GRBs, which can provide an important probe to the nature of the GRB progenitors. Finally, as luminous cosmological phenomena, it is expected to use GRBs to probe the early universe and to constrain the cosmological parameters.

title: Critical Tests of Leading Gamma Ray Burst Theories II
authors: Shlomo Dado, Arnon Dar, A. De Rújula
topic: It has been observationally established that supernovae (SNe) of Type Ic produce long duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and that neutron star mergers generate short hard GRBs. SN-Less GRBs presumably originate in a phase transition of a neutron star in a high mass X-ray binary. How these phenomena actually generate GRBs is debated. The fireball and cannonball models of GRBs and their afterglows have been widely confronted with the huge observational data, with their defenders claiming success. The claims, however, may reflect multiple choices and the use of many adjustable parameters, rather than the validity of the models. Only a confrontation of key falsifiable predictions of the models with solid observational data can test their validity. Such critical tests are reviewed in this report.

authors: Hao-Xuan Gao, Jin-Jun Geng, Lei Hu, Mao-Kai Hu, Guang-Xuan Lan, Chen-Ming Chang, Song-Bo Zhang, Xiao-Li Zhang, Yong-Feng Huang, Xue-Feng Wu
topic: The cosmological nature of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) implies that a small portion of them could be gravitationally lensed by foreground objects during their propagation. The gravitational lensing effect on the GRB prompt emission and on-axis afterglows has been discussed, and some candidates have been found in the literature. In this work, considering the high detection rate of GRB orphan afterglows in future wide-field survey era, we investigate the gravitationally lensed orphan afterglows in view of three lens models, i.e., the point-mass model, the singular isothermal sphere model, and the Chang-Refsdal model. The structure of the GRB jet itself is also incorporated in calculating the lensed afterglow light curves. It is found that lensed optical/X-ray orphan afterglows in principle could be diagnosed through their temporal characteristics, and the optical band is the best band to observe the galaxy-lensed orphan afterglows. Moreover, the event rate for galaxy-lensed orphan afterglows is estimated to be 0.7 yr-1 for the whole sky. The optimistic detection rates of the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) for galaxy-lensed orphan afterglows in the optical band are 0.02 yr-1 and 0.08 yr-1, respectively.

title: Early Evolution of a Newborn Magnetar with Strong Precession Motion in GRB 180620A
authors: Le Zou, En-Wei Liang
topic: The observed early X-ray plateau in the afterglow lightcurves of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is attributed to the dipole radiations (DRs) of a newborn magnetar. A quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signal in the plateau would be strong evidence of the magnetar precession motion. By making a time-frequency domain analysis for the X-ray afterglow lightcurve of GRB 180620A, we find a QPO signal of 650 seconds in its early X-ray plateau. We fit the lightcurve with a magnetar precession model by adopting the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The observed lightcurve and the QPO signal are well represented with our model. The derived magnetic field strength of the magnetar is Bp=(1.02+0.59-0.61)x1015G. It rapidly spins down with angular velocity evolving as Ωs∝(1+t/τsd)-0.96, where τsd=9430s. Its precession velocity evolution is even faster than Omega-s, i.e. Omega-p prop (1+t/tau-p)-2.18pm0.11, where tau-p=2239pm206-s. The inferred braking index is n=2.04. We argue that the extra energy loss via the magnetospheric processes results in its rapid spin-down, a low braking index of the magnetar, and the strong precession motion.

title: Long-term 3D-MHD Simulations of Black Hole Accretion Disks formed in Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Steven Fahlman, Rodrigo Fernández
topic: We examine the long-term evolution of accretion tori around black hole (BH) remnants of compact object mergers involving at least one neutron star, to better understand their contribution to kilonovae and the synthesis of r-process elements. To this end, we modify the unsplit magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver in FLASH4.5 to work in non-uniform three-dimensional spherical coordinates, enabling more efficient coverage of a large dynamic range in length scales while exploiting symmetries in the system. This modified code is used to perform BH accretion disk simulations that vary the initial magnetic field geometry and disk compactness, utilizing a physical equation of state, a neutrino leakage scheme for emission and absorption, and modeling the BH's gravity with a pseudo-Newtonian potential. Simulations run for long enough to achieve a radiatively-inefficient state in the disk. We find robust mass ejection with both poloidal and toroidal initial field geometries, and suppressed outflow at high disk compactness. With the included physics, we obtain bimodal velocity distributions that trace back to mass ejection by magnetic stresses at early times, and to thermal processes in the radiatively-inefficient state at late times. The electron fraction distribution of the disk outflow is broad in all models, and the ejecta geometry follows a characteristic hourglass shape. We test the effect of removing neutrino absorption or nuclear recombination with axisymmetric models, finding 50% less mass ejection and more neutron-rich composition without neutrino absorption, and a subdominant contribution from nuclear recombination. Tests of the MHD and neutrino leakage implementations are included.

title: Large Eddy Simulations of Magnetized Mergers of Neutron Stars with Neutrinos
authors: C.Palenzuela, S.L.Liebling, B.Miñano
topic: Neutron star mergers are very violent events involving extreme physical processes: dynamic, strong-field gravity, large magnetic field, very hot, dense matter, and the copious production of neutrinos. Accurate modeling of such a system and its associated multi-messenger signals, such as gravitational waves, short gamma ray burst, and kilonova, requires the inclusion of all these processes, and is increasingly important in light of advancements in multi-messenger astronomy generally, and in gravitational wave astronomy in particular (such as the development of third-generation detectors). Several general relativistic codes have been incorporating some of these elements with different levels of realism. Here, we extend our code MHDuet, which can perform large eddy simulations of magnetohydrodynamics to help capture the magnetic field amplification during the merger, and to allow for realistic equations of state and neutrino cooling via a leakage scheme. We perform several tests involving isolated and binary neutron stars demonstrating the accuracy of the code.

title: Reverse shock forming condition for magnetized relativistic outflows: reconciling theories and simulations
authors: Jing-Ze Ma, Bing Zhang
topic: Reverse shock (RS) emission can be used to probe the properties of the relativistic ejecta, especially the degree of magnetization σ, in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. However, there has been confusion in the literature regarding the physical condition for the RS formation, and the role of magnetic fields in the RS dynamics in the Poynting-flux-dominated regime is not fully understood. Exploiting the shock jump conditions, we characterize the properties of a magnetized RS. We compare the RS dynamics and forming conditions from different theories and numerical simulations, and reconcile the discrepancies among them. The strict RS forming condition is found to be [], where n4 and n1 are the rest-frame number densities of the ejecta and the ambient medium, respectively, γ4 is the bulk Lorentz factor, and σcr is the critical magnetization. Contrary to previous claims, we prove that this condition agrees with other theoretical and simulated results, which can be further applied to the setup and consistency check of future numerical simulations. Using this condition, we propose a characteristic radius for RS formation, and categorize the magnetized shell into three regimes: 'thick shell' (relativistic RS), 'thin shell' (trans-relativistic RS), and 'no RS' regimes. The critical magnetization σcr is generally below unity for thin shells, but can potentially reaches 100−1000 in the 'thick shell' regime. Our results could be applied to the dynamical evolution of Poynting-flux-dominated ejecta, with potential applications to self-consistent lightcurve modelling of magnetized relativistic outflows.

title: Quasi-stationary sequences of hyper massive neutron stars with exotic equations of state
authors: Sanika Khadkikar, Chatrik Singh Mangat, Sarmistha Banik
topic: In this work, we study the effect of differential rotation, finite temperature and strangeness on the quasi stationary sequences of hyper massive neutron stars (HMNS). We generate constant rest mass sequences of differentially rotating and uniformly rotating stars. The nucleonic matter relevant to the star interior is described within the framework of the relativistic mean field model with the DD2 parameter set. We also consider the strange Λ hyperons using the BHBΛalpha equation of state (EoS). Additionally, we probe the behaviour of neutron stars (NS) with these compositions at different temperatures. We report that the addition of hyperons to the EoS produces a significant boost to the spin-up phenomenon. Moreover, increasing the temperature can make the spin-up more robust. We also study the impact of strangeness and thermal effects on the T/W instability. Finally, we analyse equilibrium sequences of a NS following a stable transition from differential rotation to uniform rotation. The decrease in frequency relative to angular momentum loss during this transition is significantly smaller for EoS containing hyperons, compared to nucleonic EoS.

title: A New Residual Distribution Hydrodynamics Solver for Astrophysical Simulations
authors: Ben Morton, Sadegh Khochfar, Zhenyu Wu
topic: A wide array of astrophysical systems can only be accurately modelled when the behaviour of their baryonic gas components is well understood. The residual distribution (RD) family of partial differential equation (PDE) solvers can be used to solve the fluid equations, which govern this gas. We present a new implementation of the RD method to do just this. The solver efficiently and accurately calculates the evolution of the fluid, to second order accuracy in both time and space, across an unstructured Delaunay triangulation, built from an arbitrary distribution of vertices, in either 2D and 3D. We implement a novel new variable time stepping routine, which applies a drifting mechanism to greatly improve the computational efficiency of the method. We conduct extensive testing of the new implementation, demonstrating its innate ability to resolve complex fluid structures, even at very low resolution. Our implementation can resolve complex fluid structures with as few as 3-5 resolution elements, demonstrated by Kelvin-Helmholtz and Sedov blast tests. It includes three residual calculation modes, the LDA, N and blended schemes, each designed for different scenarios. These range from smooth flows (LDA), to extreme shocks (N), and scenarios where either may be encountered (blended). We compare our RD solver results to state-of-the-art solvers used in other astrophysical codes, demonstrating the competitiveness of the new approach, particularly at low resolution. This is of particular interest in large scale astrophysical simulations, where important structures, such as star forming gas clouds, are often resolved by small numbers of fluid elements.

authors: Samuele Ronchini, Marica Branchesi, Gor Oganesyan, Biswajit Banerjee, Ulyana Dupletsa, Giancarlo Ghirlanda, Jan Harms, Michela Mapelli, Filippo Santoliquido
topic: The Einstein Telescope (ET) is going to bring a revolution for the future of multi-messenger astrophysics. In order to detect the counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers at high redshift, the high-energy observations will play a crucial role. Here, we explore the perspectives of ET, as single observatory and in a network of gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, operating in synergy with future gamma-ray and X-ray satellites. We predict the high-energy emission of BNS mergers and its detectability in a theoretical framework which is able to reproduce the properties of the current sample of observed short GRBs (SGRB). We estimate the joint GW and high-energy detection rate for both the prompt and afterglow emissions, testing several combinations of instruments and observational strategies. We find that the vast majority of SGRBs detected in gamma-rays will have a detectable GW counterpart; the joint detection efficiency approaches 100% considering a network of third generation GW observatories. The probability of identifying the electromagnetic counterpart of BNS mergers is significantly enhanced if the sky localisation provided by GW instruments is observed by wide field X-ray monitors. We emphasize that the role of the future X-ray observatories will be very crucial for the detection of the fainter emission outside the jet core, which will allow us to probe the yet unexplored population of low-luminosity SGRBs in the nearby Universe, as well as to unveil the nature of the jet structure and the connections with the progenitor properties.

title: Improving the convergence order of binary neutron star merger simulations in the BSSN formulation
authors: Carolyn A. Raithel, Vasileios Paschalidis
topic: High-accuracy numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers are a necessary ingredient for constructing gravitational waveform templates to analyze and interpret observations of compact object mergers. Numerical convergence in the post-merger phase of such simulations is challenging to achieve with many modern codes. In this paper, we study two ways of improving the convergence properties of binary neutron star merger simulations within the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura formulation of Einstein's equations. We show that discontinuities in a particular constraint damping scheme in this formulation can destroy the post-merger convergence of the simulation. A continuous prescription, in contrast, ensures convergence until late times. We additionally study the impact of the equation of state parametrization on the pre- and post-merger convergence properties of the simulations. In particular, we compare results for a piecewise polytropic parametrization, which is commonly used in merger simulations but suffers unphysical discontinuities in the sound speed, with results using a "generalized" piecewise polytropic parametrization, which was designed to ensure both continuity and differentiability of the equation of state. We report on the differences in the gravitational waves depending on which equation of state parametrization is used.

title: Modeling the GRB jet properties with 3D general relativistic simulations of magnetically arrested accretion flows
authors: Bestin James, Agnieszka Janiuk, Fatemeh Hossein Nouri
topic: We investigate the dependence of the GRB jet structure and its evolution on the properties of the accreting torus in the central engine. Our models numerically evolve the accretion disk around a Kerr black hole using 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We use two different analytical hydrodynamical models of the accretion disk, based on the Fishbone-Moncrief and Chakrabarti solutions, as our initial states for the structure of the collapsar disk and the remnant after a binary neutron star merger, respectively. We impose poloidal magnetic fields of two different geometries upon the initial stable solutions. We study the formation and evolution of the magnetically arrested disk state and its effect on the properties of the emitted jet. The jets produced in our models are structured and have a relatively hollow core and reach higher Lorentz factors at an angle 9deg from the axis. The jet in our short GRB model has an opening angle of up to 25deg while our long GRB engine produces a narrower jet, of up to 11deg. We also study the time variability of the jets and provide an estimate of the minimum variability timescale in our models. The application of our models to the GRB jets in the binary neutron star post-merger system and to the ultra-relativistic jets launched from collapsing stars are briefly discussed.

title: Tungsten vs Selenium as a potential source of kilonova nebular emission observed by Spitzer
authors: Kenta Hotokezaka, Masaomi Tanaka, Daiji Kato, Gediminas Gaigalas
topic: Infrared emission lines arising from transitions between fine structure levels of heavy elements are expected to produce kilonova nebular emission. For the kilonova in GW170817, strong emission at 4.5 mic-m at late times was detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope but no source was detected at 3.6 moc-m. This peculiar spectrum indicates that there exist strong line emitters around 4.5 mic-m and the absence of strong lines around 3.6 mic-m. To model the spectrum we prepare a line list based on the selection rules in LS coupling from the experimentally calibrated energy levels in the NIST database. This method enables to generate the synthetic spectra with accurate line wavelengths. We find that the spectrum is sensitive to the abundance pattern whether or not the first r-process peak elements are included. In both cases, the synthetic spectra can match the observed data, leading to two possible interpretations. If the first peak elements are abundant a Se III line dominates the flux. If otherwise, W III with Os III, Rh III, and Ce IV can be the main sources. Observing nebular spectra for the future kilonovae in a wider wavelength range can provide more conclusive elemental identification.

authors: J. A. Rueda, Liang Li, R. Moradi, R. Ruffini, N. Sahakyan, Y. Wang
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are systems of unprecedented complexity across all the electromagnetic spectrum, including the radio, optical, X-rays, gamma-rays in the megaelectronvolt (MeV) and gigaelectronvolt (GeV) regime, as well as ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), each manifested in seven specific physical processes with widely different characteristic evolution timescales ranging from 10-14 s to 107 s or longer. We here study the long GRB 180720B originating from a binary system composed of a massive COcore of about 10Msun and a companion neutron star (NS). The gravitational collapse of the COcore gives rise to a spinning newborn NS (νNS), with an initial period of P0=1 ms that powers the synchrotron radiation in the radio, optical, and X-ray wavelengths. We here investigate solely the GRB 180720B afterglows and present a detailed treatment of its origin based on the synchrotron radiation released by the interaction of the νNS and the SN ejecta. We show that in parallel to the X-ray afterglow, the spinning νNS also powers the optical and radio afterglows and allows to infer the νNS and ejecta parameters that fit the observational data.

title: Origin of intense electron heating in relativistic blast waves
authors: Arno Vanthieghem (NINS/PU), Martin Lemoine (IAP), Laurent Gremillet (CEA)
topic: The modeling of gamma-ray burst afterglow emission bears witness to strong electron heating in the precursor of Weibel-mediated, relativistic collisionless shock waves propagating in unmagnetized electron-ion plasmas. In this Letter, we propose a theoretical model, which describes electron heating via a Joule-like process caused by pitch-angle scattering in the decelerating, self-induced microturbulence and the coherent charge-separation field induced by the difference in inertia between electrons and ions. The emergence of this electric field across the precursor of electron-ion shocks is confirmed by large-scale particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Integrating the model using a Monte Carlo-Poisson method, we compare the main observables to the PIC simulations to conclude that the above mechanism can indeed account for the bulk of electron heating.

title: Neutrino Driven Explosions aided by Axion Cooling in Multidimensional Simulations of Core-Collapse Supernovae
authors: Aurore Betranhandy, Evan O'Connor
topic: In this study, we present the first multidimensional core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) simulations including QCD axions in order to assess the impact on the CCSN explosion mechanism. We include axions in our simulations through the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung emission channel and as a pure energy-sink term under the assumption that the axions free-stream after being emitted. We perform both spherically symmetric (1D) and axisymmetric (2D) simulations. In 1D, we utilize a parameterized heating scheme to achieve explosions, whereas in 2D we self-consistently realize explosions through the neutrino heating mechanism. Our 2D results for a 20Msun progenitor show an impact of the axion emission on the shock behavior and the explosion time when considering values of the Peccei-Quinn energy scale []. The strong cooling due to the axion emission accelerates the contraction of the core and leads to more efficient neutrino heating and earlier explosions. For the axion emission formalism utilized, the values of fa that impact the explosion are close to, but in tension with current limits based on the neutrinos detected from SN1987A. However, given the non-linear behavior of the emission and the multidimensional nature of CCSNe,we suggest that a self-consistent, multidimensional approach to simulating CCSNe, including any late time accretion and cooling, is needed to fully explore the axion bounds from supernovae and the impact on the CCSN explosion mechanism.

title: KilonovaNet: Surrogate Models of Kilonova Spectra with Conditional Variational Autoencoders
authors: Kamilė Lukošiūtė, Geert Raaijmakers, Zoheyr Doctor, Marcelle Soares-Santos, Brian Nord
topic: Detailed radiative transfer simulations of kilonova spectra play an essential role in multimessenger astrophysics. Using the simulation results in parameter inference studies requires building a surrogate model from the simulation outputs to use in algorithms requiring sampling. In this work, we present KilonovaNet, an implementation of conditional variational autoencoders (cVAEs) for the construction of surrogate models of kilonova spectra. This method can be trained on spectra directly, removing overhead time of pre-processing spectra, and greatly speeds up parameter inference time. We build surrogate models of three state-of-the-art kilonova simulation data sets and present in-depth surrogate error evaluation methods, which can in general be applied to any surrogate construction method. By creating synthetic photometric observations from the spectral surrogate, we perform parameter inference for the observed light curve data of GW170817 and compare the results with previous analyses. Given the speed with which KilonovaNet performs during parameter inference, it will serve as a useful tool in future gravitational wave observing runs to quickly analyze potential kilonova candidates

title: GRMHD Simulations of Accreting Neutron Stars with Non-Dipole Fields
authors: Pushpita Das, Oliver Porth, Anna Watts
topic: NASA's NICER telescope has recently provided evidence for non-dipolar magnetic field structures in rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. These stars are assumed to have gone through a prolonged accretion spin-up phase, begging the question of what accretion flows onto stars with complex magnetic fields would look like. We present results from a suite of GRMHD simulations of accreting neutron stars for dipole, quadrupole, and quadrudipolar stellar field geometries. This is a first step towards simulating realistic hotspot shapes in a general relativistic framework to understand hotspot variability in accreting millisecond pulsars. We find that the location and size of the accretion columns resulting in hotspots changes significantly depending on initial stellar field strength and geometry. We also find that the strongest contributions to the stellar torque are from disk-connected fieldlines and the pulsar wind, leading to spin-down in almost all of the parameter regime explored here. We further analyze angular momentum transport in the accretion disk due to large scale magnetic stresses, turbulent stresses, wind- and compressible effects which we identify with convective motions. The disk collimates the initial open stellar flux forming jets. For dipoles, the disk-magnetosphere interaction can either enhance or reduce jet power compared to the isolated case. However for quadrupoles, the disk always leads to an enhanced net open flux making the jet power comparable to the dipolar case. We discuss our results in the context of observed neutron star jets and provide a viable mechanism to explain radio power both in the low- and high-magnetic field case.

topic: The merger of two compact objects of which at least one is a neutron star is signalled by transient electromagnetic emission in a kilonova. This event is accompanied by gravitational waves and possibly other radiation messengers such as neutrinos or cosmic rays. The electromagnetic emission arises from the radioactive decay of heavy r-process elements synthesised in the material ejected during and after the merger. In this paper we show that the analysis of kilonovae light curves can provide cosmological distance measurements and constrain the properties of the ejecta. In this respect, MAAT, the new Integral Field Unit in the OSIRIS spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC), is well suited for the study of kilonovae by performing absolute spectro-photometry over the entire 360-1000 nm spectral range. Here, we study the most representative cases regarding the scientific interest of kilonovae from binary neutron stars, and evaluate the observational prospects and performance of MAAT on the GTC to: a) study the impact of the equation of state on the kilonovae light curves, and to what extent bounds on neutron star radii or compactness deriving from their peak magnitudes can be identified and b) measure the Hubble constant, H0, with improved precision, up to 40%, when both gravitational wave data and photometric light curves are used. In this context we discuss how the equation of state, the viewing-angle, and the distance affect the precision and estimated value of H0.

title: Effects of a strong phase transition on supernova explosions, compact stars and their mergers
authors: Andreas Bauswein, David Blaschke, Tobias Fischer
topic: We outline a theoretical approach supporting strong phase transitions from normal nuclear matter to the deconfined quark-gluon plasma, in the equation of state (EOS) for compact star matter. Implications of this hypothesis are discussed for astrophysical applications. Special emphasis is devoted to potentially detectable signatures, which can be directly related with the occurrence of a sufficiently strong phase transition. Therefore, simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary compact star mergers are considered, including the subsequent emission of gravitational waves and, in the case of supernova, in addition the neutrinos play the role of messengers.

title: Pasta properties of the neutron star within effective relativistic mean-field model
authors: Vishal Parmar, H. C. Das, Ankit Kumar, Ankit Kumar, M. K. Sharma, P. Arumugam, S. K. Patra
topic: We study the properties of pasta structures and their influence on the neutron star observables employing the effective relativistic mean-field theory (E-RMF). The compressible liquid drop model is used to incorporate the finite size effects, considering the possibility of non-spherical structures in the inner crust. The unified equation of state are constructed for several E-RMF parameters to study various properties such as pasta mass and thickness in the neutron star's crust. The majority of the pasta properties are sensitive to the symmetry energy in the subsaturation density region. Using the results from Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate the shear modulus of the crust in context of quasiperiodic oscillations from soft gamma-ray repeaters and calculate the frequency of fundamental torsional oscillation mode in the inner crust. Global properties of the neutron star such as mass-radius profile, the moment of inertia, crustal mass, crustal thickness and fractional crustal moment of inertia are worked out. The results are consistent with various observational and theoretical constraints.

title: Evidence for the transition of a Jacobi ellipsoid into a Maclaurin spheroid in gamma-ray bursts
authors: J. A. Rueda, R. Ruffini, L. Li, R. Moradi, J. F. Rodriguez, Y. Wang
topic: In the binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) scenario, long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in a cataclysmic event that occurs in a binary system composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion in close orbit. The collapse of the CO star generates at its center a newborn NS (NS), and a supernova (SN) explosion. Matter from the ejecta is accreted both onto the NS because of fallback and onto the NS companion, leading to the collapse of the latter into a black hole (BH). Each of the ingredients of the above system leads to observable emission episodes in a GRB. In particular, the NS is expected to show up (hereafter NS-rise) in the early GRB emission, nearly contemporary or superimposed to the ultrarelativistic prompt emission (UPE) phase, but with a different spectral signature. Following the NS-rise, the NS powers the afterglow emission by injecting energy into the expanding ejecta leading to synchrotron radiation. We here show that the NS-rise and the subsequent afterglow emission in both systems, GRB 180720B and GRB 190114C, are powered by the release of rotational energy of a Maclaurin spheroid, starting from the bifurcation point to the Jacobi ellipsoid sequence. This implies that the NS evolves from a triaxial Jacobi configuration, prior to the NS-rise, into the axially symmetric Maclaurin configuration observed in the GRB. The triaxial NS configuration is short-lived (less than a second) due to a copious emission of gravitational waves, before the GRB emission, and it could be in principle detected for sources located at distances closer than 100 Mpc. This appears to be the sole process of emission of gravitational waves in long GRBs.

title: Three-Dimensional General-Relativistic Simulations of Neutrino-Driven Winds from Rotating Proto-Neutron Stars
authors: Dhruv K. Desai, Daniel M. Siegel, Brian D. Metzger
topic: We explore the effects of rapid rotation on the properties of neutrino-heated winds from proto-neutron stars (PNS) formed in core-collapse supernovae or neutron-star mergers by means of three-dimensional general-relativistic hydrodynamical simulations with M0 neutrino transport. We focus on conditions characteristic of a few seconds into the PNS cooling evolution when the neutrino luminosities obey [], and over which most of the wind mass-loss will occur. After an initial transient phase, all of our models reach approximately steady-state outflow solutions with positive energies and sonic surfaces captured on the computational grid. Our non-rotating and slower-rotating models (angular velocity relative to Keplerian []; spin period P larger 2 ms) generate approximately spherically symmetric outflows with properties in good agreement with previous PNS wind studies. By contrast, our most rapidly spinning PNS solutions ([]; P = 1 ms) generate outflows focused in the rotational equatorial plane with much higher mass-loss rates (by over an order of magnitude), lower velocities, lower entropy, and lower asymptotic electron fractions, than otherwise similar non-rotating wind solutions. Although such rapidly spinning PNS are likely rare in nature, their atypical nucleosynthetic composition and outsized mass yields could render them important contributors of light neutron-rich nuclei compared to more common slowly rotating PNS birth. Our calculations pave the way to including the combined effects of rotation and a dynamically-important large-scale magnetic field on the wind properties within a 3D GRMHD framework.

title: Fast Neutrino Conversion in Hydrodynamic Simulations of Neutrino-Cooled Accretion Disks
authors: Oliver Just (1), Sajad Abbar (2), Meng-Ru Wu (3), Irene Tamborra (4), Hans-Thomas Janka (5), Francesco Capozzi (6)
topic: The outflows from neutrino-cooled black-hole (BH) accretion disks formed in neutron-star mergers or cores of collapsing stars are expected to be neutron-rich enough to explain a large fraction of elements created by the rapid neutron-capture (r-) process, but their precise chemical composition remains elusive. Here, we investigate the role of fast neutrino flavor conversion, motivated by the findings of our post-processing analysis that shows evidence of electron-neutrino lepton-number (ELN) crossings deep inside the disk, hence suggesting possibly non-trivial effects due to neutrino flavor mixing. We implement a parametric, dynamically self-consistent treatment of fast conversion in time-dependent simulations and examine the impact on the disk and its outflows. By activating the, otherwise inefficient, emission of heavy-lepton neutrinos, fast conversions enhance the disk cooling rates and reduce the absorption rates of electron-type neutrinos, causing a reduction of the electron fraction in the disk by 0.03-0.06 and in the ejected material by 0.01-0.03. The r-process yields are enhanced by typically no more than a factor of two, rendering the overall impact of fast conversions modest. The kilonova is prolonged as a net result of increased lanthanide opacities and enhanced radioactive heating rates. We observe only mild sensitivity to the disk mass, the condition for the onset of flavor conversion, and to the considered cases of flavor mixing. Remarkably, parametric models of flavor mixing that conserve the lepton numbers per family result in an overall smaller impact than models invoking three-flavor equipartition, often assumed in previous works.

authors: Mauro Mariani, Daniela Curin, Milva G. Orsaria, Ignacio F. Ranea-Sandoval
topic: The most recent detections of LIGO/Virgo and NICER have placed strong constraints on neutron stars' properties. In this work, we study neutron stars modeling them as hybrid stars, compact objects with a quark matter core surrounded by layers of hadronic matter. In addition, we consider the presence of strong magnetic fields, motivated by magnetars detection, like the recently discovered Swift J1818.0-1607. We incorporate the effects of the anomalous magnetic moment of the constituent particles into the equation of state of dense matter and analyze the implications of different hadron-quark phase transitions on the dynamic stability of these compact objects. This study shows that the constraints on the mass, radius, and tidal deformability, imposed by observations of massive pulsars and gravitational waves can be satisfied within the framework of our model.

title: Microphysics of diffusive shock acceleration: impact on the spectrum of accelerated particles
authors: Pierre Cristofari, Pasquale Blasi, Damiano Caprioli
topic: Diffusive shock acceleration at collisionless shocks remains the most likely process for accelerating particles in a variety of astrophysical sources. While the standard prediction for strong shocks is that the spectrum of accelerated particles is universal, [], numerous phenomena affect this simple conclusion. In general, the non-linear dynamical reaction of accelerated particles leads to a concave spectrum, steeper than p-4 at momenta below a few tens of GeV/c and harder than the standard prediction at high energies. However, the non-linear effects become important in the presence of magnetic field amplification, which in turn leads to higher values of the maximum momentum pmax. It was recently discovered that the self-generated perturbations that enhance particle scattering, when advected downstream, move in the same direction as the background plasma, so that the effective compression factor at the shock decreases and the spectrum becomes steeper. We investigate the implications of the excitation of the non-resonant streaming instability on these spectral deformations, the dependence of the spectral steepening on the shock velocity and the role played by the injection momentum.

title: Efficiency of Nonthermal Particle Acceleration in Magnetic Reconnection
authors: Masahiro Hoshino
topic: The nonthermal particle acceleration during magnetic reconnection remains a fundamental topic in several astrophysical phenomena, such as solar flares, pulsar wind, magnetars, etc, for more than half a century, and one of the unresolved questions is its efficiency. Recently, nonthermal particle acceleration mechanisms during reconnection have been extensively studied by particle-in-cell simulations, yet it is an intriguing enigma as to how the magnetic field energy is divided into thermally heated plasmas and nonthermal particles. Here we study both non-relativistic and relativistic magnetic reconnections using large-scale particle-in-cell simulation for a pair plasma, and indicate that the production of the nonthermal particle becomes efficient with increasing the plasma temperature. In the relativistic hot plasma case, we determine that the heated plasmas by reconnection can be approximated by a kappa distribution function with the kappa index of approximately 3 or less (equivalent to 2 or less for the power-law index), and the nonthermal energy density of reconnection is approximately over 95% of the total internal energy in the downstream exhaust.

title: Long-term evolution of supercritical black hole accretion with outflows: a subgrid feedback model for cosmological simulations
authors: Haojie Hu, Kohei Inayoshi, Zoltán Haiman, Eliot Quataert, Rolf Kuiper
topic: We study the long-term evolution of the global structure of axisymmetric accretion flows onto a black hole (BH) at rates substantially higher than the Eddington value (M-Edd), performing two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with and without radiative diffusion. In the high-accretion optically-thick limit, where the radiation energy is efficiently trapped within the inflow, the accretion flow becomes adiabatic and comprises of turbulent gas in the equatorial region and strong bipolar outflows. As a result, the mass inflow rate decreases toward the center as [] and a small fraction of the inflowing gas feeds the nuclear BH. Thus, super-Eddington accretion is sustained only when a larger amount of gas is supplied from larger radii at [] The global structure of the flow settles down to a quasi-steady state in millions of the orbital timescale at the BH event horizon, which is 10−100 times longer than that addressed in previous (magneto-)RHD simulation studies. Energy transport via radiative diffusion accelerates the outflow near the poles in the inner region but does not change the overall properties of the accretion flow compared to the cases without diffusion. Based on our simulation results, we provide a mechanical feedback model for super-Eddington accreting BHs. This can be applied as a sub-grid model in large-scale cosmological simulations that do not sufficiently resolve galactic nuclei, and to the formation of the heaviest gravitational-wave sources via accretion in dense environments.

title: On the Sound Speed in Neutron Stars
authors: Sinan Altiparmak, Christian Ecker, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: Determining the sound speed cs in compact stars is an important open question with numerous implications on the behaviour of matter at large densities and hence on gravitational-wave emission from neutron stars. To this scope, we construct more than 107 equations of state (EOSs) with continuous sound speed and build more than 108 nonrotating stellar models consistent not only with nuclear theory and perturbative QCD, but also with astronomical observations. In this way, we find that EOSs with sub-conformal sound speeds, i.e. with c2s less 1/3 within the stars, are possible in principle but very unlikely in practice, being only 0.03 \% of our sample. Hence, it is natural to expect that c2s lagrmer 1/3 somewhere in the stellar interior. Using our large sample, we obtain estimates at 95 \% credibility of neutron-star radii for representative stars with 1.4 and 2.0 solar masses, R1.4 = 12.42+0.52-0.99km, R2.0=12.12+1.11-1.23km, and for the binary tidal deformability of the GW170817 event, Lambda = 1.186=485+225-211. Interestingly, our lower-bounds on the radii are in very good agreement with the prediction derived from very different arguments, namely, the threshold mass. Finally, we provide simple analytic expressions to determine the minimum and maximum values of Lambda as a function of the chirp mass.

authors: Jaikhomba Singha, S. Mullai Vaneshwar, Ankit Kumar
topic: We utilise the phenomenologically parameterized piecewise polytropic equations of state to study various neutron star properties. We investigate the compliance of these equations of state with several astronomical observations. We also demonstrate that the theoretical estimates of the fractional moment of inertia cannot explain all the pulsar glitches observed. We model the crust as a solid spheroidal shell to calculate the fractional moment of inertia of fast-spinning neutron stars. We also show that the braking index obtained in a simple magnetic dipole radiation model with a varying moment of inertia deviates significantly from the observed data. Future developments in both theory and observations may allow us to use the fractional moment of inertia and braking index as observational constraints for neutron star equation of state.

We discuss parameter estimation with this model, and how it can be used to extract information from beyond-GR waveforms.

authors: Di Xiao, Fayin Wang, Zigao Dai
topic: The era of fast radio bursts (FRBs) was open in 2007, when a very bright radio pulse of unknown origin was discovered occasionally in the archival data of Parkes Telescope. Over the past fifteen years, this mysterious phenomenon have caught substantial attention among the scientific community and become one of the hottest topic in high-energy astrophysics. The total number of events has a dramatic increase to a few hundred recently, benefiting from new dedicated surveys and improved observational techniques. Our understanding of these bursts has been undergoing a revolutionary growth with observational breakthroughs announced consistently. In this chapter, we will give a comprehensive introduction of FRBs, including the latest progress. Starting from the basics, we will go through population study, inherent physical mechanism, and all the way to the application in cosmology. Plenty of open questions exist right now and there is more surprise to come in this active young field.

title: Numerical Investigation of Dynamical and Morphological Trends in Relativistic Jets
authors: Soham Mandal, Paul C. Duffell, Yuan Li
topic: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) show a range of morphologies and dynamical properties, which are determined not only by parameters intrinsic to the central engine but also their interaction with the surrounding environment. We investigate the connection of kiloparsec scale AGN jet properties to their intrinsic parameters and surroundings. This is done using a suite of 40 relativistic hydrodynamic simulations spanning a wide range of engine luminosities and opening angles. We explore AGN jet propagation with different ambient density profiles, including r-2 (self-similar solution) and r-1, which is more relevant for AGN host environments. The Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological dichotomy arises naturally in our models. Jets with low energy density compared to the ambient medium produce a center-brightened emissivity distribution, while emissivity from relatively higher energy density jets is dominated by a terminal bright spot. We observe recollimation shocks in our simulations that can generate bright spots along the spine of the jet, providing a possible explanation for "knots" observed in AGN jets. We additionally find a scaling relation between the number of knots and the jet-head-to-surroundings energy density ratio. This scaling relation is generally consistent with the observations of the jets in M87 and Cygnus A. Our model also correctly predicts M87 as FR I and Cygnus A as FR II. Our model can be used to relate jet dynamical parameters such as jet head velocity, jet opening angle, and external pressure to jet power and ambient density estimates.

topic: Pulses from 16 previously known rotating radio transients (RRAT) have been searched at the 110 MHz daily monitor program for 4 to 5.5 years by using the Large-Phased-Array (LPA) at Pushchino. The total number of pulses detected in such a long observation interval is only 90 pulses for RRAT J0640+07 or is as high as 10,751 pulses for RRAT J0302+22. The number and amplitude of pulses varies at a time-scales from six to twenty months for RRATs J1336+33, J1404+11, J1848+15, J2051+12, J2105+22, and the pulse number can increase by one or two orders of magnitude in active phases. The long-term trends are found for RRATs J0139+33 and J0302+22, showing a 2-3 times increase in detected pulse number over 1,959 days. Some RRATs show the annual variations on both pulse number and pulse amplitude. It is hard to explain all these variation time scales by refractive scintillation on the interstellar medium. The annual and semi-annual variations are likely caused by scintillations of the inhomogeneous interplanetary plasma. Our data show that the number of observational sessions with no pulse detection over the threshold decreases exponentially with the length of pulse silence.

title: Nonlinear behaviour of warped discs around a central object with a quadrupole moment
authors: Hongping Deng, Gordon Ogilvie
topic: The nonlinear behaviour of low-viscosity warped discs is poorly understood. We verified a nonlinear bending-wave theory, in which fluid columns undergo affine transformations, with direct 3D hydrodynamical simulations. We employed a second-order Godunov-type scheme, Meshless Finite Mass (MFM), and also the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method, with up to 128M particles. For moderate nonlinearity, MFM maintains well the steady nonlinear warp predicted by the affine model for a tilted inviscid disc around a central object with a quadrupole moment. However, numerical dissipation in SPH is so severe that even a low-amplitude nonlinear warp degrades at a resolution where MFM performs well. A low-amplitude arbitrary warp tends to evolve towards a nonlinear steady state. However, no such state exists in our thin disc with an angular semi-thickness H/R = 0.02 when the outer tilt angle is beyond about 14 degrees. The warp breaks tenuously and reconnects in adiabatic simulations, or breaks into distinct annuli in isothermal simulations. The breaking radius lies close to the location with the most extreme nonlinear deformation. Parametric instability is captured only in our highest-resolution simulation, leading to ring structures that may serve as incubators for planets around binaries.

title: Nonthermal particle acceleration from maximum entropy in collisionless plasmas
authors: Vladimir Zhdankin
topic: Dissipative processes cause collisionless plasmas in many systems to develop nonthermal particle distributions with broad power-law tails. The prevalence of power-law energy distributions in space/astrophysical observations and kinetic simulations of systems with a variety of acceleration and trapping (or escape) mechanisms poses a deep mystery. We consider the possibility that such distributions can be modeled from maximum-entropy principles, when accounting for generalizations beyond the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. Using a dimensional representation of entropy (related to the Renyi and Tsallis entropies), we derive generalized maximum-entropy distributions with a power-law tail determined by the energy scale at which irreversible dissipation occurs. By assuming that particles are energized by an amount comparable to the free energy (per particle) before equilibrating, we derive a formula for the power-law index as a function of plasma parameters for magnetic dissipation in systems with sufficiently complex topologies. The model reproduces several results from kinetic simulations of relativistic turbulence and magnetic reconnection.

The star mass M can take any value up to a maximum 9.14x10-6 M_sun. For each value of M the star radius R lies between 5.23cm and 13.6cm. More than one value of R is possible when M > 5.09x10-6 M_sun. For those stars, a transition from larger to smaller R would release gravitational energy on the order of 1041J in a time on the order of 10-10s.

title: Angular momentum transport and thermal stabilization of optically thin, advective accretion flows through large-scale magnetic fields
authors: Sudeb Ranjan Datta, Tushar Mondal, Banibrata Mukhopadhyay
topic: Outward transport of angular momentum, as well as viscous and thermal stability, are the necessary criteria for the formation of accretion disc and to radiate steadily. Turbulent motions originating from magneto-rotational instability or hydrodynamic instability can do the required transport. We explore the effect of a large-scale magnetic field (LSMF) over the turbulent transport in an optically thin advective disc. In this work, turbulent transport is represented through the usual Shakura-Sunyaev alpha-viscosity. The evolution of the magnetic field and other variables is found by solving vertically integrated height averaged magnetohydrodynamic equations. Depending on its configuration, the LSMF can support or oppose α in outward transport of angular momentum. Once outward transport of angular momentum is assured, i.e., formation of the disc is confirmed through the combined effect of alpha-viscosity and the LSMF, we explore the impact of the LSMF in thermally stabilizing the disc. As found earlier, we also find that the advection of heat energy becomes zero or negative with increasing accretion rate. That is why at or above a critical accretion rate, the optically thin advective disc becomes thermally unstable. We show however that with the addition of a strong enough magnetic field, the disc regains its thermal stability and Joule heating turns out to play the key role in that. Throughout our analysis the plasma-beta (beta-m) remains within the range of 5-103, which does not impose any restriction in the simultaneous operation of the LSMF and the turbulent transport.

authors: Uwe Schmitt, Beatrice Moser, Christiane S. Lorenz, Alexandre Refregier
topic: Computer algebra systems play an important role in science as they facilitate the development of new theoretical models. The resulting symbolic equations are often implemented in a compiled programming language in order to provide fast and portable codes for practical applications. We describe sympy2c, a new Python package designed to bridge the gap between the symbolic development and the numerical implementation of a theoretical model. sympy2c translates symbolic equations implemented in the SymPy Python package to C/C++ code that is optimized using symbolic transformations. The resulting functions can be conveniently used as an extension module in Python. sympy2c is used within the PyCosmo Python package to solve the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, a large system of ODEs describing the evolution of linear perturbations in the Universe. After reviewing the functionalities and usage of sympy2c, we describe its implementation and optimization strategies. This includes, in particular, a novel approach to generate optimized ODE solvers making use of the sparsity of the symbolic Jacobian matrix. We demonstrate its performance using the Einstein-Boltzmann equations as a test case. sympy2c is widely applicable and may prove useful for various areas of computational physics. sympy2c is publicly available at this https URL

title: Confronting a set of Skyrme and chi-EFT predictions for the crust of neutron stars
authors: Guilherme Grams, Jérôme Margueron, Rahul Somasundaram, Sanjay Reddy
topic: With the improved accuracy of neutron star observational data, it is necessary to derive new equation of state where the crust and the core are consistently calculated within a unified approach. For this purpose we describe non-uniform matter in the crust of neutron stars employing a compressible liquid-drop model, where the bulk and the neutron fluid terms are given from the same model as the one describing uniform matter present in the core. We then generate a set of fifteen unified equations of state for cold catalyzed neutron stars built on realistic modelings of the nuclear interaction, which belongs to two main groups: the first one derives from the phenomenological Skyrme interaction and the second one from ci-EFT Hamiltonians. The confrontation of these model predictions allows us to investigate the model dependence for the crust properties, and in particular the effect of neutron matter at low density. The new set of unified equations of state is available at the CompOSE repository.

topic: The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggers on-board in response to 40 short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) per year; however, their large localization regions have made the search for optical counterparts a challenging endeavour. We have developed and executed an extensive program with the wide field of view of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera, mounted on the Palomar 48 inch Oschin telescope (P48), to perform target-of-opportunity (ToO) observations on 10 Fermi-GBM SGRBs during 2018 and 2020-2021. Bridging the large sky areas with small field of view optical telescopes in order to track the evolution of potential candidates, we look for the elusive SGRB afterglows and kilonovae (KNe) associated with these high-energy events. No counterpart has yet been found, even though more than 10 ground based telescopes, part of the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) network, have taken part in these efforts. The candidate selection procedure and the follow-up strategy have shown that ZTF is an efficient instrument for searching for poorly localized SGRBs, retrieving a reasonable number of candidates to follow-up and showing promising capabilities as the community approaches the multi-messenger era. Based on the median limiting magnitude of ZTF, our searches would have been able to retrieve a GW170817-like event up to 200 Mpc and SGRB afterglows to z = 0.16 or 0.4, depending on the assumed underlying energy model. Future ToOs will expand the horizon to z = 0.2 and 0.7 respectively.

title: Simultaneous Inference of Neutron Star Equation of State and Hubble Constant with a Population of Merging Neutron Stars
authors: Tathagata Ghosh, Bhaskar Biswas, Sukanta Bose
topic: We develop a method for implementing a proposal on utilizing knowledge of neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) for inferring the Hubble constant from a population of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. This method is useful in exploiting BNSs as standard sirens when their redshifts are unavailable. Gravitational wave (GW) signals from compact object binaries provide a direct measurement of their luminosity distances, but not the redshifts. Unlike in the past, we employ a realistic EoS parameterization in a Bayesian framework to simultaneously measure the Hubble constant and refine the constraints on the EoS parameters. The uncertainty in the redshift depends on the uncertainty in EoS and mass parameters estimated from GW data. Combining the inferred BNS redshifts with the corresponding luminosity distances, one constructs a redshift-distance relationship and deduces the Hubble constant from it. Here, we show that in the Cosmic Explorer era, one can measure the Hubble constant to a precision of 3% (with a 90% credible interval) with a realistic distribution of thousand BNSs, while allowing for uncertainties in their EoS parameters. The methodology implemented in this work demonstrates a comprehensive algorithm to infer NS EoS and the Hubble constant by simultaneously combining GW observations from merging NSs, choosing a simple population model of NS masses and keeping the merger rate of NSs constant. This method can be immediately extended to incorporate merger rate, population properties, and different cosmological parameters.

topic: Gravitational wave observations of large mass ratio compact binary mergers like GW190814 highlight the need for reliable, high-accuracy waveform templates for such systems. We present NRHybSur2dq15, a new surrogate model trained on hybridized numerical relativity (NR) waveforms with mass ratios q-15, and aligned spins. We target the parameter space of GW190814-like events as large mass ratio NR simulations are very expensive. The model includes the (2,2), (2,1), (3,3), (4,4), and (5,5) spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes, and spans the entire LIGO bandwidth (with flow=20 Hz) for total masses M=9.5Msun. NRHybSur2dq15 accurately reproduces the hybrid waveforms, with mismatches below  for total masses . This is at least an order of magnitude improvement over existing semi-analytical models for GW190814-like systems. Finally, we reanalyze GW190814 with the new model and obtain source parameter constraints consistent with previous work.

topic: Following the detection of a long GRB 190919B by INTEGRAL (INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory), we obtained an optical photometric sequence of its optical counterpart. The light curve of the optical emission exhibits an unusually steep rise 100 s after the initial trigger. This behaviour is not expected from a 'canonical' GRB optical afterglow. As an explanation, we propose a scenario consisting of two superimposed flares: an optical flare originating from the inner engine activity followed by the hydrodynamic peak of an external shock. The inner-engine nature of the first pulse is supported by a marginal detection of flux in hard X-rays. The second pulse eventually concludes in a slow constant decay, which, as we show, follows the closure relations for a slow cooling plasma expanding into the constant interstellar medium and can be seen as an optical afterglow sensu stricto.

title: Modelling observable signatures of jet-ISM interaction: thermal emission and gas kinematics
authors: Moun Meenakshi, Dipanjan Mukherjee, Alexander Y. Wagner, Nicole P. H. Nesvadba, Raffaella Morganti, Reinier M. J. Janssen, Geoffrey V. Bicknell, Ralph S. Sutherland, Ankush Mandal
topic: Relativistic jets are believed to have a substantial impact on the gas dynamics and evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) of their host galaxies. In this paper, we aim to draw a link between the simulations and the observable signatures of jet-ISM interactions by analyzing the emission morphology and gas kinematics resulting from jet-induced shocks in simulated disc and spherical systems. We find that the jet-induced laterally expanding forward shock of the energy bubble sweeping through the ISM causes large-scale outflows, creating shocked emission and high-velocity dispersion in the entire nuclear regions (2 kpcs) of their hosts. The jetted systems exhibit larger velocity widths ( 800 km/s), broader Position-Velocity maps and distorted symmetry in the disc's projected velocities than systems without a jet. We also investigate the above quantities at different inclination angles of the observer with respect to the galaxy. Jets inclined to the gas disc of its host are found to be confined for longer times, and consequently couple more strongly with the disc gas. This results in prominent shocked emission and high-velocity widths, not only along the jet's path, but also in the regions perpendicular to them. Strong interaction of the jet with a gas disc can also distort its morphology. However, after the jets escape their initial confinement, the jet-disc coupling is weakened, thereby lowering the shocked emission and velocity widths.

title: Advancing the Landscape of Multimessenger Science in the Next Decade
authors: Kristi Engel, Tiffany Lewis, Marco Stein Muzio, et al
topic: The last decade has brought about a profound transformation in multimessenger science. Ten years ago, facilities had been built or were under construction that would eventually discover the nature of objects in our universe could be detected through multiple messengers. Nonetheless, multimessenger science was hardly more than a dream. The rewards for our foresight were finally realized through IceCube's discovery of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux, the first observation of gravitational waves by LIGO, and the first joint detections in gravitational waves and photons and in neutrinos and photons. Today we live in the dawn of the multimessenger era. The successes of the multimessenger campaigns of the last decade have pushed multimessenger science to the forefront of priority science areas in both the particle physics and the astrophysics communities. Multimessenger science provides new methods of testing fundamental theories about the nature of matter and energy, particularly in conditions that are not reproducible on Earth. This white paper will present the science and facilities that will provide opportunities for the particle physics community renew its commitment and maintain its leadership in multimessenger science.

title: Revisiting black hole hyperaccretion in the center of gamma-ray bursts for the lower mass gap
authors: Hui-Min Qu, Tong Liu
topic: The ultrarelativistic jets triggered by neutrino annihilation processes or Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanisms in stellar-mass black hole (BH) hyperaccretion systems are generally considered to power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Due to the high accretion rate, the central BHs might grow rapidly on a short timescale, providing a new way to understand "the lower mass gap" problem. In this paper, we use the BH hyperaccretion model to investigate BH mass growth based on observational GRB data. The results show that (i) if the initial BH mass is set as 3 Ms, the neutrino annihilation processes are capable of fueling the BHs to escape the lower mass gap for more than half of long-duration GRBs (LGRBs), while the BZ mechanism is inefficient on triggering BH growths for LGRBs; (ii) the mean BH mass growths in the case of LGRBs without observable supernova (SN) association are much larger than these in the case of LGRBs associated with SNe for both mechanisms, which imply that more massive progenitors or lower SN explosion energies prevail throughout the former cases; (iii) for the short-duration GRBs, the mean BH mass growths are satisfied with the mass supply limitation in the scenario of compact object mergers, but the hyperaccretion processes are unable to rescue BHs from the gap in binary neutron star (NS) mergers or the initial BH mass being 3 M⊙ after NS-BH mergers.

title: Measurement of MHD turbulence properties by synchrotron radiation techniques
authors: Jianfu Zhang (Xiangtan Univ.), Ruyue Wang (Xiangtan Univ.)
topic: It is well-known that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is ubiquitous in astrophysical environments. The correct understanding of the fundamental properties of MHD turbulence is a prerequisite for revealing many key astrophysical processes. The development of observation-based measurement techniques has significantly promoted MHD turbulence theory and its implications in astrophysics. After describing the modern understanding of MHD turbulence based on theoretical analysis and direct numerical simulations, we review recent developments related to synchrotron fluctuation techniques. Specifically, we comment on the validation of synchrotron fluctuation techniques and the measurement performance of several properties of magnetic turbulence based on data cubes from MHD turbulence simulations and observations. Furthermore, we propose to strengthen the studies of the magnetization and 3D magnetic field structure's measurements of interstellar turbulence. At the same time, we also discuss the prospects of new techniques for measuring magnetic field properties and understanding astrophysical processes, using a large number of data cubes from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).

Based on the nuclear energy-density functional theory, these equations of state provide a thermodynamically consistent treatment of all regions of the stars and were calculated using functionals that were precision fitted to experimental and theoretical nuclear data.

title: Nearly model independent constraints on dense matter equation of state in a Bayesian approach
authors: N. K. Patra, Sk Md Adil Imam, B. K. Agrawal, Arunava Mukherjee, Tuhin Malik
topic: We apply Bayesian approach to construct a large number of minimally constrained equations of state (EoSs) and study their correlations with a few selected properties of neutron star (NS). Our set of minimal constraints includes a few basic properties of saturated nuclear matter and low density pure neutron matter EoS which is obtained from a precise next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) calculation in chiral effective field theory. The tidal deformability and radius of NS with mass 1-2Msun are found to be strongly correlated with the pressure of beta-equilibrated matter as well as with the symmetry energy at densities higher than the saturation density, in a nearly model independent manner. These correlations are employed to parametrize the pressure for beta-equilibrated matter, around 2rho0, as a function of neutron star mass and the corresponding tidal deformability. The maximum mass of neutron star is also strongly correlated with the pressure of symmetric and beta-equilibrated matter at densities .

title: Diagnosing Circumburst Environment with Multiband Gamma-Ray Burst Radio Afterglows
authors: Bo Zhang, Liang-Duan Liu, Tian-Rui Sun, Fen Lyu, Xue-Feng Wu
topic: It has been widely recognized that gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows arise from interactions between GRB outflow and circumburst medium, while their evolution follows the behaviors of relativistic shock waves. Assuming the distribution of circumburst medium follows a general power-law form, that is, WR, where R denotes the distance from the burst, it is obvious that the value of density-distribution index k can affect the behaviors of the afterglow. In this paper, we analyze the temporal and spectral behaviors of GRB radio afterglows with arbitrary k-values. In the radio band, a standard GRB afterglow produced by forward shock exhibits a late-time flux peak, and the relative peak fluxes as well as peak times at different frequencies show dependencies on k. Thus with multi-band radio peak observations, one can determine the density profile of circumburst medium by comparing the relations between peak flux/time and frequency at each observing band. Also, the effects of trans-relativistic shock waves, as well as jets in afterglows are discussed. By analyzing 31 long and 1 short GRBs with multi-band data of radio afterglows, we find that nearly half of them can be explained with uniform interstellar medium (k=0), 1/5 can be constrained to exhibiting stellar wind environment (k=2), while less than 1/3 samples show k in [0,2].

title: Broadband Emission from a Kilonova Ejecta-Pulsar Wind Nebula System: Late-Time X-ray Afterglow Rebrightening of GRB 170817A
authors: Jia Ren, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: We study the broadband radiation behavior of a kilonova ejecta-pulsar wind nebula (PWN) system. In this model, we jointly fit the observations of AT 2017gfo in UV-optical-IR bands and the late-time X-ray afterglow of GRB 170817A. Our work shows that a PWN powered by the remnant neutron star (NS) post GW170817 event could affect the optical transient AT 2017gfo and re-brighten the late-time X-ray afterglow of GRB 170817A. The PWN radiation will regulate the trend of future X-ray observations from a flattening to a steep decline until some other sources (e.g., a kilonova afterglow) become dominant. The restricted ranges of the central NS parameters in this work are consistent with the previous works based on the observations of AT 2017gfo only. In addition, the new fitting result indicates that the NS wind is highly magnetized. We point out that the radio and X-ray emission from a kilonova ejecta-PWN system could be an important electromagnetic feature of binary NS mergers when a long-lived remnant NS is formed. Therefore, observations of a kilonova ejecta-PWN system will provide important information to inferring the nature of a merger remnant.

title: Bare Collapse, Formation of Neutron Star Binaries and Fast Optical Transients
authors: Ron Mor, Eli Livne, Tsvi Piran
topic: {"Bare collapse", the collapse of a bare stellar core to a neutron star with a very small mass ejection links two seemingly unrelated phenomena: the formation of binary neutron star (BNS) systems and the observations of fast and luminous optical transients. We carried out calculations of the collapse due to electron-capture of both evolutionary and synthetic isentropic bare stellar cores. We find that the collapse results in {the formation of} a light - 1.3 solar mass neutron star and {an} ejection of 0.1 solar mass at 0.1c. The outer shell of the ejecta is composed of Ni56 that can power an ultra-stripped supernova. The models we explored can explain most of the observed fast optical flares but not the brightest ones. Collapse of cores surrounded by somewhat more massive envelopes can produce larger amounts of Ni56 and explain brighter flares. Alternatively, those events can arise due to interaction of the very energetic ejecta with winds that were ejected from the progenitor a few days before the collapse.

title: ExHaLe-jet: An extended hadro-leptonic jet model for blazars. I. Code description and initial results
authors: Michael Zacharias, Anita Reimer, Catherine Boisson, Andreas Zech
topic: The processes operating in blazar jets are still an open question. Modeling the radiation emanating from an extended part of the jet allows one to capture these processes on all scales. Kinetic codes solving the Fokker-Planck equation along the jet flow are well suited to this task, as they can efficiently derive the radiation and particle spectra without the need for computationally demanding plasma-physical simulations. Here, we present a new extended hadro-leptonic jet code -- ExHaLe-jet -- which considers simultaneously the processes of relativistic protons and electrons. Within a pre-set geometry and bulk flow, the particle evolution is derived self-consistently. Highly relativistic secondary electrons (and positrons) are created through g-g pair production, Bethe-Heitler pair production, and pion/muon decay. These secondaries are entrained in the jet flow decreasing the ratio of protons to electrons with distance from the jet base. For particle-photon interactions, we consider all internal and many external photon fields, such as the accretion disk, broad-line region, and the dusty torus. The external fields turn out to be the most important source for particle-photon interactions governing the resulting photon and neutrino spectra. In this paper, we present the code and an initial parameter study, while in follow-up works we present extensions of the code and more specific applications.

title: Simulating neutron star mergers with the Lagrangian Numerical Relativity code SPHINCS\_BSSN
authors: P. Diener, S. Rosswog, F. Torsello
topic: We present the first neutron star merger simulations performed with the newly developed Numerical Relativity code SPHINCS BSSN. This code evolves the spacetime on a mesh using the BSSN formulation, but matter is evolved via Lagrangian particles according to a high-accuracy version of general-relativistic Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Our code contains a number of new methodological elements compared to other Numerical Relativity codes. The main focus here is on the new elements that were introduced to model neutron star mergers. These include a) a refinement (fixed in time) of the spacetime-mesh, b) corresponding changes in the particle--mesh mapping algorithm and c) a novel way to construct SPH initial data for binary systems via the recently developed "Artificial Pressure Method." This latter method makes use of the spectral initial data produced by the library LORENE, and is implemented in a new code called SPHINCS ID. While our main focus is on introducing these new methodological elements and documenting the current status of SPHINCS BSSN, we also show as a first application a set of neutron star merger simulations employing "soft" (Gamma=2.00) and "stiff" (Gamma=2.75) polytropic equations of state.

title: Modelling the formation of the first two neutron star-black hole mergers, GW200105 and GW200115: metallicity, chirp masses and merger remnant spins
authors: Debatri Chattopadhyay, Simon Stevenson, Floor Broekgaarden, Fabio Antonini, Krzysztof Belczynski
topic: The two neutron star-black hole mergers (GW200105 and GW200115) observed in gravitational waves by advanced LIGO and Virgo, mark the first ever discovery of such binaries in nature. We study these two neutron star-black hole systems through isolated binary evolution, using a grid of population synthesis models. Using both mass and spin observations (chirp mass, effective spin and remnant spin) of the binaries, we probe their different possible formation channels in different metallicity environments. Our models only support LIGO data when assuming the black hole is non spinning. Our results show a strong preference that GW200105 and GW200115 formed from stars with sub-solar metallicities Z less 0.005. Only two metal-rich (Z=0.02) models are in agreement with GW200115. We also find that chirp mass and remnant spins jointly aid in constraining the models, whilst the effective spin parameter does not add any further information.

title: New constraints on the neutron-star mass and radius relation from the terrestrial nuclear experiments
authors: Hajime Sotani, Nobuya Nishimura, Tomoya Naito
topic: The study of the equation of state (EOS) for nuclear matter has been still a challenging problem, although the EOS is essential for determining the properties of neutron stars. In order to constrain the EOS, several studies have been based on astronomical observations with the X-ray and gravitational waves, which mainly cover the higher density of neutron star matter. In this study, focusing on the relatively lower density region, we show an allowed area in the neutron-star mass and radius relation by using the constraints on the density-dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy obtained via the recent nuclear experiments with different projects (i.e., SπRIT and PREX-II) together with the experiment at RCNP. Each region predicted by these experiments is still consistent with the area in the higher density allowed by the various astronomical observations. Our results show that terrestrial nuclear experiments must provide further constraints on the EOS for neutron stars, complementing astronomical observations.

title: Mapping Progenitors of Binary Black Holes and Neutron Stars with Binary Population Synthesis
authors: Miqaela K. Weller, Jennifer A. Johnson
topic: The first directly observed gravitational wave event, GW150914, featuring the merger of two massive black holes, highlighted the need to determine how these systems of compact remnant binaries are formed. We use the binary population synthesis code COSMIC (Compact Object Synthesis and Monte Carlo Investigation Code) to predict the types of massive stars that will show significant radial velocity variations, indicative of a potential compact object (i.e. a black hole or neutron star) orbiting the star. We "observe" the binaries generated in the populations with a similar number of epochs and RV accuracy as planned for the Milky Way Mapper. In this analysis, we are especially interested in systems where a compact remnant is orbiting a massive O or B star as these systems survived the first supernova and neutron star kick. We test the ability of the Milky Way Mapper observing strategy to distinguish among different mass loss and kick prescriptions. We find that Wolf-Rayet stars or hot subdwarfs in binaries could be detectable (i.e. luminous, high delta RV max), viable progenitors of such objects, while the different prescriptions primarily affect the number of sources.

title: Externally-driven plasma models as candidates for pulsar radio emission
authors: Sk. Minhajur Rahaman, Dipanjan Mitra, George I. Melikidze
topic: Coherent radio emission from pulsars originates from excited plasma waves in an ultra-relativistic and strongly magnetized electron-positron pair plasma streaming along the open magnetic field lines of the pulsar. Traditional coherent radio emission models have relied on instabilities in this pair plasma. Recently alternative models have been suggested. These models appeal to direct coupling of the external electromagnetic field to the superluminal O-mode (lt2 mode) during the time-dependent pair cascade process at the polar gap. The objective of this work is to provide generic constraints on plasma models based on lt2 mode using realistic pulsar parameters. We find that the very short timescale associated with pair cascades does not allow lt2 mode to be excited at radio frequencies and the impulsive energy transfer can only increase the kinetic spread ("temperature") of the pair plasma particles. Moreover, under homogeneous plasma conditions, plasma waves on both branches of O-mode (i.e. superluminal lt2 and subluminal lt1) cannot escape the plasma. In the strongly magnetized pair plasma, only the extraordinary mode (t mode) can escape freely. We show that any generic fictitious mechanisms does not result in the wave electric field of t mode to have predominant orientation either or perpendicular to the magnetic field plane as observed. Such fictitious mechanisms will inevitably lead to depolarization of signals and cannot account for the highly polarized single pulses observed in pulsars. We suggest coherent curvature radiation as a promising candidate for pulsar radio emission mechanism.

title: Merger and post-merger of binary neutron stars with a quark-hadron crossover equation of state
authors: Yong-Jia Huang, Luca Baiotti, Toru Kojo, Kentaro Takami, Hajime Sotani, Hajime Togashi, Tetsuo Hatsuda, Shigehiro Nagataki, Yi-Zhong Fan
topic: Fully general-relativistic binary-neutron-star (BNS) merger simulations with quark-hadron crossover (QHC) equations of state (EOSs) are studied for the first time. In contrast to EOSs with purely hadronic matter or with a first-order quark-hadron transition, in the transition region QHC EOSs show a peak in sound speed, and thus a stiffening. We study the effects of such stiffening in the merger and post-merger gravitational (GW) signals. Through simulations in the binary-mass range 2.5 less Msun less 2.75, characteristic differences due to different EOSs appear in the frequency of the main peak of the post-merger GW spectrum (f2), extracted through Bayesian inference. In particular, we found that (i) for lower-mass binaries, since the maximum baryon number density (nmax) after the merger stays below 3-4 times the nuclear-matter density (n0), the characteristic stiffening of the QHC models in that density range results in a lower f2 than that computed for the underlying hadronic EOS and thus also than that for EOSs with a first-order phase transition, and (ii) for higher-mass binaries, where nmax may exceed 4-5n0 depending on the EOS model, whether f2 in QHC models is higher or lower than that in the underlying hadronic model depends on the height of the sound-speed peak. Comparing the values of f2 for different EOSs and BNS masses gives important clues on how to discriminate different types of quark dynamics in the high-density end of EOSs and is relevant to future kHz GW observations with third-generation GW detectors.

title: Accretion of the magnetized neutrino-cooled torus
authors: Fatemeh Hossein Nouri, Agnieszka Janiuk
topic: Neutrino-cooled accretion flow around a black hole, produced by a compact binary merger, is a promising scenario for jet formation and magnetic-driven winds to explain short duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) central engine and kilonovae based on GW170817 gravitational wave observation. Magnetorotational instability (MRI) turbulence and Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism are expected to play key roles in the thermal equilibrium of the disk (balancing neutrino cooling) and in driving accretion and creating jets. Using the open-source GRMHD HARM-COOL code, we study the magnetically-driven evolution of an accretion disk with realistic equation of state in the fixed curved space-time background. We identify the effects of the neutrino cooling and the magnetic field, paying particular attention to the dynamical, thermal and composition evolution of the disk and outflows.

title: Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients and Type Ibn/Icn SNe from Wolf-Rayet/Black Hole Mergers
authors: Brian D. Metzger
topic: Progenitor models for the "luminous" subclass of Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs; prototype: AT2018cow) are challenged to simultaneously explain all of their observed properties: fast optical rise times < days; peak luminosities >1e44 erg/s; low yields <0.1 Msun of 56Ni; aspherical ejecta with a wide velocity range (<3000 km/s to > 0.1-0.5 c with increasing polar latitude); presence of hydrogen-depleted-but-not-free dense circumstellar material (CSM) on radial scales from 1e14 cm to 3e16 cm; embedded variable source of non-thermal X-ray/gamma-rays, suggestive of a compact object. We show that all of these properties are consistent with the tidal disruption and hyper-accretion of a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star by a black hole (BH) or neutron star (NS) binary companion. In contrast with related previous models, the merger occurs with a long delay following the common envelope (CE) event responsible for birthing the binary, as a result of gradual angular momentum loss to a relic circumbinary disk. Disk-wind outflows from the merger-generated accretion flow generate the 56Ni-poor aspherical ejecta with the requisite velocity range. The optical light curve is powered primarily by reprocessing X-rays from the inner accretion flow/jet, though CSM shock interaction also contributes. Primary CSM sources include mass-loss from WR star (e.g., from the L2 point) during the earliest stages of the merger (1e14 cm) and the relic CE disk and its photoevaporation-driven wind (e16 cm). Longer delayed mergers may instead give rise to supernovae Type Ibn/Icn (depending on the WR evolutionary state), potentially connecting these transient classes with LFBOTs.

title: Cross-correlating dark sirens and galaxies: measurement of H0 from GWTC-3 of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA
authors: Suvodip Mukherjee, Alex Krolewski, Benjamin D. Wandelt, Joseph Silk
topic: We measure the Hubble constant of the Universe using spatial cross-correlation between gravitational wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts from the third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3), and the photometric galaxy surveys 2MPZ and WISE-SuperCOSMOS. Using the eight well-localised GW events, we obtain Hubble constant H0=68.2+26.0-6.2 km/s/Mpc (median and 68.3\% equal-tailed interval (ETI)) after marginalizing over the matter density and the GW bias parameters. Though the constraints are weak due to a limited number of GW sources and poor sky localization, they are not subject to assumptions regarding the GW mass distribution. By combining this measurement with the Hubble constant measurement from binary neutron star GW170817, we find a value of Hubble constant H0=67.0+6.3−3.8 km/s/Mpc (median and 68.3% ETI).

title: Gravitomagnetic interaction of a Kerr black hole with a magnetic field as the source of the jetted GeV radiation of gamma-ray bursts
authors: J. A. Rueda, R. Ruffini, R. P. Kerr
topic: We show that the gravitomagnetic interaction of a Kerr black hole (BH) with a surrounding magnetic field induces an electric field that accelerates charged particles to ultra-relativistic energies in the vicinity of the BH. Along the BH rotation axis, these electrons/protons can reach energies of even thousands of PeV, so stellar-mass BHs in long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and supermassive BHs in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can contribute to the ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) thorough this mechanism. At off-axis latitudes, the particles accelerate to energies of hundreds of GeV and emit synchrotron radiation at GeV energies. This process occurs within 60deg around the BH rotation axis, and due to the equatorial-symmetry, it forms a double-cone emission. We outline the theoretical framework describing these acceleration and radiation processes, how they extract the rotational energy of the Kerr BH and the consequences for the astrophysics of GRBs.

title: A Comprehensive Study of Bright Fermi-GBM Short Gamma-Ray Bursts: I. Multi-Pulse Lightcurves and Multi-Component Spectra
authors: Peng-Wei Zhao, Qing-Wen Tang
topic: Sorted by the photon fluences of short Gamma-ray Bursts (SGRBs) detected by the Fermi- Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM), nine brightest bursts are selected to perform a comprehensive analysis. All GRB lightcurves are fitted well by 1 to 3 pulses that are modelled by fast-rising exponential decay profile (FRED), within which the resultant rising time is strongly positive-correlated with the full time width at half maxima (FWHM). A photon spectral model involving a cutoff power-law function and a standard blackbody function (CPL + BB) could reproduce the spectral energy distributions of these SGRBs well in the bursting phase. The CPL's peak energy is found strongly positive-correlated with the BB's temperature, which indicates they might be from the same physical origin. Possible physical origins are discussed to account for these correlations.

title: Multi-physics constraints at different densities to probe nuclear symmetry energy in hyperonic neutron stars
authors: Suprovo Ghosh, Bikram Keshari Pradhan, Debarati Chatterjee, Jürgen Schaffner-Bielich
topic: The appearance of strangeness in the form of hyperons within the inner core of neutron stars is expected to affect its detectable properties such as its global structure or gravitational wave emission. In this work, we explore the parameter space of hyperonic stars within the framework of the Relativistic Mean Field model allowed by present uncertainties in state-of-the-art nuclear and hypernuclear experimental data. We impose multi-physics constraints at different density regimes to restrict the parameter space: Chiral effective field theory, heavy-ion collision data as well as multi-messenger astrophysical observations of neutron stars. We investigate possible correlations between empirical nuclear and hypernuclear parameters, particularly the symmetry energy and its slope, with observable properties of neutron stars. We do not find a correlation for the hyperon parameters and the astrophysical data. However, the inclusion of hyperons generates a tension between the astrophysical and heavy ion data constraining considerable the available parameter space.

title: Engine-fed Kilonovae (Mergernovae) -- I. Dynamical Evolution and Energy Injection / Heating Efficiencies
authors: Shunke Ai, Bing Zhang, Zhaohuan Zhu
topic: A binary neutron star merger is expected to be associated by a kilonova, transient optical emission powered by radioactive decay of the neutron-rich ejecta. If the post-merger remnant is a long-lived neutron star, additional energy injection to the ejecta is possible. Hence, a long-lived neutron star can serve as the engine of the kilonova. In this first paper of a series, we study the dynamical evolution of the engine-fed kilonova (mergernova) ejecta in detail. We perform a semi-analytical study of the problem by adopting a modified mechanical blastwave model that invokes interaction between a Poynting-flux-dominated flow and a non-magnetized massive ejecta. Shortly after the engine is turned on, a pair of shocks would be excited. The reverse shock quickly reaches the wind-acceleration region and disappears, whereas the forward shock soon breaks out from the ejecta and continues to propagate in the surrounding interstellar medium. Most of the energy injected into the blastwave from the engine is stored as magnetic energy and kinetic energy. The internal energy fraction is fint \l 0.3 for an ejecta mass equal to 10-3Msun. Overall, the energy injecting efficiency Xi is at most 0.6 and can be as small as 0.04 at later times. Contrary to the previous assumption, efficient heating only happens before the forward shock breaks out of the ejecta with a heating efficiency Xit-(0.006-0.3), which rapidly drops to ∼0 afterwards. The engine-fed kilonova lightcurves will be carefully studied in Paper II.

title: Flare echos from relaxation shocks in perturbed relativistic jets
authors: Gaëtan Fichet de Clairfontaine, Zakaria Meliani, Andreas Zech
topic: One of the main scenarios to account for the multi-wavelength flux variability observed in relativistic jets of AGNs is based on diffusive shock acceleration of a population of relativistic electrons on internal shocks of various origins. Any complete AGN emission scenario has to be able to explain the wide range of observed variability time scales between the radio and gamma-ray band. In addition constraints are also provided by very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI), which shows a large variety of moving and standing emission zones with distinct behaviors. We aim to characterize the evolution of stationary and moving emission zones in the jet and to study their multi-wavelength signatures through emission maps and light curves. We focus our study on flare events that occur during strong interactions between moving ejecta and stationary recollimation shocks. We simulate relativistic jets with the magneto-hydrodynamic code MPI-AMRVAC and inject non-thermal particle distributions of electrons in shock regions. We follow the propagation of a moving shock and its interactions with a structure of standing re-collimation shocks in the jet. Synchrotron emission and radiative transfer are calculated in the post-processing code RIPTIDE for given observation angles and frequencies. We demonstrate the appearance of trailing components behind the leading moving shock. The latter destabilizes the jet, causing the emergence of oscillating standing shocks and relaxation shocks. Emissions from these regions can dominate the overall flux or lead to flare echos in the light curve. Another observational marker of relaxation shocks appears in time-distance plots of bright VLBI components of the jet. Our scenario provides a plausible explanation for radio VLBI observations of the radio-galaxy 3C 111 where trailing components have been observed during a radio outburst event in 1997.

title: Thermal Relaxation of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Star
authors: Ankit Kumar, H. C. Das, S. K. Patra
topic: Motivated by the various theoretical studies regarding the efficient capturing of dark matter by neutron stars, we explore the possible indirect effects of captured dark matter on the cooling mechanism of a neutron star. The equation of states for different configurations of dark matter admixed star at finite temperature is obtained using the relativistic mean-field formalism with the IOPB-I parameter set. We show that the variation in the dark matter momentum vastly modifies the neutrino emissivity through specific neutrino generating processes of the star. The specific heat and the thermal conductivity of a dark matter admixed star have also been investigated to explore the propagation of cooling waves in the interior of the star. The dependence of theoretical surface temperature cooling curves on the equation of state and chemical composition of the stellar matter has also been discussed along with the observational data of thermal radiation from various sources. We observed that the dark matter admixed canonical stars with kDMf \g 0.04 comply with the fast cooling scenario. Further, the metric for internal thermal relaxation epoch has also been calculated with different dark matter momentum and we deduced that increment of dark matter segment amplify the cooling and internal relaxation rates of the star.

title: A hot and luminous source at the site of the fast transient AT2018cow at 2-3 years after its explosion
authors: Ning-Chen Sun, Justyn R. Maund, Paul A. Crowther, Liang-Duan Liu
topic: We report the discovery of a luminous late-time source at the position of the fast blue optical transient (FBOT) AT2018cow on images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at 714 d and 1136 d after its explosion. This source is detected at both UV and optical wavelengths and has prominent Halpha emission. It has a very stable brightness between the two epochs and a very blue spectral energy distribution (SED) consistent with [], i.e. the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of a hot blackbody with a very high temperature of log(T/K) > 4.6 and luminosity of log(L/Lsun) > 7.0. This late-time source is unlikely to be an unrelated object in chance alignment, or due to a light echo of AT2018cow. Other possible scenarios also have some difficulties in explaining this late-time source, including companion star(s), star cluster, the survived progenitor star, interaction with circumstellar medium (CSM), magnetar, or delayed accretion in a tidal disruption event (TDE). Long-term and multi-wavelength monitoring will help to resolve its nature and finally reveal the origin of the "Cow".

topic: All disc-accreting astrophysical objects produce powerful outflows. In binaries containing neutron stars (NS) or black holes, accretion often takes place during violent outbursts. The main disc wind signatures during these eruptions are blue-shifted X-ray absorption lines, which are preferentially seen in disc-dominated "soft states". By contrast,optical wind-formed lines have recently been detected in "hard states", when a hot corona dominates the luminosity. The relationship between these signatures is unknown, and no erupting system has revealed wind-formed lines between the X-ray and optical bands yet, despite the many strong resonance transitions in this ultraviolet (UV) region. Here, we show that the transient NS binary Swift J1858.6-0814 exhibits wind-formed, blue-shifted absorption associated with C IV, N V and He II in time-resolved UV spectroscopy during a luminous hard state. This represents the first evidence for a warm, moderately ionized outflow component in this state. Simultaneously observed optical lines also display transient blue-shifted absorption. Decomposing the UV data into constant and variable components, the blue-shifted absorption is associated with the former. This implies that the outflow is not connect to the luminous flares in the data. The joint presence of UV and optical wind features reveals a multi-phase and/or stratified outflow from the outer disc. This type of persistent mass loss across all accretion states has been predicted by radiation-hydrodynamic simulations and helps to explain the shorter-than-expected outbursts duration.

title: Binary evolution, gravitational-wave mergers and explosive transients in multiple-populations gas-enriched globular-clusters
authors: Mor Rozner, Hagai B. Perets
topic: Most globular clusters (GCs) show evidence for multiple stellar populations, suggesting the occurrence of several distinct star-formation episodes. The large fraction of second population (2P) stars observed requires a very large 2P gaseous mass to have accumulated in the cluster core to form these stars. Hence the first population of stars (1P) in the cluster core has had to become embedded in 2P gas, just prior to the formation of later populations. Here we explore the evolution of binaries in ambient 2P gaseous media of multiple-population GCs. We mostly focus on black hole binaries and follow their evolution as they evolve from wide binaries towards short periods through interaction with ambient gas, followed by gravitational-wave (GW) dominated inspiral and merger. We show this novel GW-merger channel could provide a major contribution to the production of GW-sources. We consider various assumptions and initial conditions and calculate the resulting gas-mediated change in the population of binaries and the expected merger rates due to gas-catalyzed GW-inspirals. For plausible conditions and assumptions, we find an expected GW merger rate observable by aLIGO of the order of up to a few tens of Gpc-3yr-1, and an overall range for our various models of 0.08-25.51 Gpc-3yr-1. Finally, our results suggest that the conditions and binary properties in the early stage of GCs could be critically affected by gas-interactions and may require a major revision in the current modeling of the evolution of GCs.

title: The Hardness-intensity Correlation of Photospheric Emission from a Structured Jet for Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Xinying Song, Yan-Zhi Meng
topic: For many gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), hardness-intensity correlation (HIC) can be described by a power-law function, Ep propto Fκ, where Ep is the peak energy of nuFnu spectrum, and F is the instantaneous energy flux. In this paper, HIC of the non-dissipative photospheric emission from a structured jet is studied in different regimes. An intermediate photosphere, which contains both of unsaturated and saturated emissions is introduced, and we find positive kappa<1/4 in this case. The same conclusion could be generalized to the photospheric emission from a hybrid jet without magnetic dissipations, or that with sub-photospheric magnetic dissipations and fully thermalized. This may imply that the contribution peaking at 1/2 in the distribution of observed κ are mainly from the prompt emission of GRBs with synchrotron origin. Besides, emissions of the intermediate photosphere could give a smaller low-energy photon index alpha than that in the unsaturated regime, and naturally reproduce anti-correlation in alpha-Ep in a GRB pulse.

title: Low-luminosity supernovae: SN 2005cs and SN 2020cxd as very low-energy iron core-collapse explosions
authors: Alexandra Kozyreva, Hans-Thomas Janka, Daniel Kresse, Stefan Taubenberger
topic: SN 2020cxd is a representative of the family of low-energy, underluminous Type IIP supernovae (SNe), whose observations and analysis were recently reported by Yang et al. (2021). Here we re-evaluate the observational data for the diagnostic SN properties by employing the hydrodynamic explosion model of a 9 MSun red supergiant progenitor with an iron core and a pre-collapse mass of 8.75 Msun. The explosion of the star was obtained by the neutrino-driven mechanism in a fully self-consistent simulation in three dimensions (3D). Multi-band light curves and photospheric velocities for the plateau phase are computed with the one-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics code STELLA, applied to the spherically averaged 3D explosion model as well as spherisized radial profiles in different directions of the 3D model. We find that the overall evolution of the bolometric light curve, duration of the plateau phase, and basic properties of the multi-band emission can be well reproduced by our SN model with its explosion energy of only 0.7x10to50 erg and an ejecta mass of 7.4 Msun. These values are considerably lower than the previously reported numbers, but they are compatible with those needed to explain the fundamental observational properties of the prototype low-luminosity SN 2005cs. Because of the good compatibility of our photospheric velocities with line velocities determined for SN 2005cs, we conclude that the line velocities of SN 2020cxd are probably overestimated by up to a factor of about 3. The evolution of the line velocities of SN 2005cs compared to photospheric velocities in different explosion directions might point to intrinsic asymmetries in the SN ejecta.

title: Diffusive shock acceleration at oblique high Mach number shocks
authors: Allard Jan van Marle, Artem Bohdan, Paul J. Morris, Martin Pohl, Alexandre Marcowith
topic: The current paradigm of cosmic ray (CR) origin states that the most part of galactic CRs is produced by supernova remnants. The interaction of supernova ejecta with the interstellar medium after supernova's explosions results in shocks responsible for CR acceleration via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). We use particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and a combined PIC-magnetohydrodynamic (PIC-MHD) technique to investigate whether DSA can occur in oblique high Mach number shocks. Using the PIC method, we follow the formation of the shock and determine the fraction of the particles that gets involved in DSA. Then, with this result, we use PIC-MHD simulations to model the large-scale structure of the plasma and the magnetic field surrounding the shock and find out whether or not the reflected particles can generate the upstream turbulence and trigger DSA. We find that the feasibility of this process in oblique shocks depends strongly on the Alfvenic Mach number, and the DSA process is more likely triggered at high Mach number shocks.

title: Electromagnetic counterparts of binary neutron star mergers leading to a strongly magnetized long-lived remnant neutron star
authors: Kyohei Kawaguchi, Sho Fujibayashi, Kenta Hotokezaka, Masaru Shibata, Shinya Wanajo
topic: We explore the electromagnetic counterparts that will associate with binary neutron star mergers for the case that remnant massive neutron stars survive for 0.5 s after the merger. For this study, we employ the outflow profiles obtained by long-term general-relativistic neutrino-radiation magneto-hydrodynamics simulations with a mean field dynamo effect. We show that a synchrotron afterglow with high luminosity can be associated with the merger event if the magnetic fields of the remnant neutron stars are significantly amplified by the dynamo effect. We also perform a radiative transfer calculation for kilonovae and find that for the highly amplified magnetic field cases, the kilonovae can be bright in the early epoch (t 0.5d), while it shows rapid declining (less 1d) emission and long-lasting ( - 10d) emission in the optical and near-infrared wavelength, respectively. All these features have not been found in GW170817, indicating that the merger remnant neutron star formed in GW170817 might have collapsed to a black hole within several hundreds ms or magnetic-field amplification might be a minor effect.

title: Energy balance and Alfvén Mach numbers in compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with a large-scale magnetic field
authors: James R. Beattie, Mark R. Krumholz, Raphael Skalidis, Christoph Federrath, Amit Seta, Roland M. Crocker, Philip Mocz, Neco Kriel
topic: Energy equipartition is a powerful theoretical tool for understanding astrophysical plasmas. It is invoked, for example, to measure magnetic fields in the interstellar medium (ISM), as evidence for small-scale turbulent dynamo action, and, in general, to estimate the energy budget of star-forming molecular clouds. In this study we motivate and explore the role of the volume-averaged root-mean-squared (rms) magnetic coupling term between the turbulent, delta B and large-scale, B0 fields, . By considering the second moments of the energy balance equations we show that the rms coupling term is in energy equipartition with the volume-averaged turbulent kinetic energy for turbulence with a sub-Alfvénic large-scale field. Under the assumption of exact energy equipartition between these terms, we derive relations for the magnetic and coupling term fluctuations, which provide excellent, parameter-free agreement with time-averaged data from 280 numerical simulations of compressible MHD turbulence. Furthermore, we explore the relation between the turbulent, mean-field and total Alfvén Mach numbers, and demonstrate that sub-Alfvénic turbulence can only be developed through a strong, large-scale magnetic field, which supports an extremely super-Alfvénic turbulent magnetic field. This means that the magnetic field fluctuations are significantly subdominant to the velocity fluctuations in the sub-Alfvénic large-scale field regime. Throughout our study, we broadly discuss the implications for observations of magnetic fields and understanding the dynamics in the magnetised ISM.

title: Jet Launching from Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Incorporating Neutrino Transport and Magnetic Fields
authors: Lunan Sun, Milton Ruiz, Stuart L. Shapiro, Antonios Tsokaros
topic: We perform general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of merging binary neutron stars incorporating neutrino transport and magnetic fields. Our new radiative transport module for neutrinos adopts a general relativistic, truncated-moment (M1) formalism. The binaries consist of two identical, irrotational stars modeled by the SLy nuclear equation of state (EOS). They are initially in quasicircular orbit and threaded with a poloidal magnetic field that extends from the stellar interior into the exterior, as in typical pulsars. We insert neutrino processes shortly after the merger and focus on the role of neutrinos in launching a jet following the collapse of the hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant to a spinning black hole (BH). We treat two microphysical versions: one (a "warm-up") evolving a single neutrino species and considering only charged-current processes, and the other evolving three species  and related processes. We trace the evolution until the system reaches a quasiequilibrium state after BH formation. We find that the BH + disk remnant eventually launches an incipient jet. The electromagnetic Poynting luminosity is 1053ergs-1, consistent with that of typical short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). The effect of neutrino cooling shortens the lifetime of the HMNS, and lowers the amplitude of the major peak of the gravitational wave (GW) power spectrum somewhat. After BH formation, neutrinos help clear out the matter near the BH poles, resulting in lower baryon-loaded surrounding debris. The neutrino luminosity resides in the range 1052−53ergs−1 once quasiequilibrium is achieved. Comparing with the neutrino-free models, we observe that the inclusion of neutrinos yields similar ejecta masses and is inefficient in carrying off additional angular momentum.

title: Magnetization of Current-Carrying Jets
authors: Dominika Ł. Król, Łukasz Stawarz, Mitchell C. Begelman, José-María Martí, Manel Perucho, Bohdan A. Petrenko
topic: Astrophysical jets, launched from the immediate vicinity of accreting black holes, carry away large amounts of power in a form of bulk kinetic energy of jet particles and electromagnetic flux. Here we consider a simple analytical model for relativistic jets at larger distances from their launching sites, assuming a cylindrical axisymmetric geometry with a radial velocity shear, and purely toroidal magnetic field. We argue that, as long as the jet plasma is in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium, such outflows tend to be particle dominated, i.e. the ratio of the electromagnetic to particle energy flux, integrated over the jet cross-sectional area, is typically below unity, sigma less 1. At the same time, for particular magnetic and radial velocity profiles, magnetic pressure may still dominate over particle pressure for certain ranges of the jet radius, i.e. the local jet plasma parameter , and this may be relevant in the context of particle acceleration and production of high-energy emission in such systems. The jet magnetization parameter can be elevated up to the modest values sigma\leq10 only in the case of extreme gradients or discontinuities in the gaseous pressure, and a significantly suppressed velocity shear. Such configurations, which consist of a narrow, unmagnetized jet spine surrounded by an extended, force-free layer, may require an additional poloidal field component to stabilize them against current-driven oscillations, but even this will not elevate substantially their sigma parameter.

title: GRB 200826A: A Precursor of a Long GRB with Missing Main Emission
authors: Xiangyu Ivy Wang, Bin-Bin Zhang, Wei-Hua Lei
topic: The recently discovered peculiar Gamma-ray Burst, GRB 200826A, poses a dilemma for the collapsar model. Although all other characteristics of the burst are consistent with it being a Type II (i.e., collapse of a massive star) event, the observed duration of the event is only approximately one second, which is at odds with the predicted allowable timescale range for a collapsar event. To resolve this dilemma, this Letter proposes that the original burst could be an intrinsically long GRB comprised of a precursor and a main emission (ME) phase. However, the ME phase is missed due to either precession of the jet or the blockage of a companion star, leaving only the precursor observed as a short-duration GRB 200826A. Interestingly, we found that the temporal and spectral properties of GRB 200826A broadly resembled those of the bright precursor observed in GRB 160625B. Furthermore, assuming the prototype burst of GRB 200826A is similar to GRB 160625B, we found that the observer may indeed miss its ME because of geometric effects caused either by jet precession or companion blockage models. Our approach provides a natural explanation for the GRB 200826A-like bursts and agrees with the rarity of those events.

title: Delta-resonances and hyperons in proto-neutron stars and merger remnants
authors: Armen Sedrakian, Arus Harutyunyan
topic: The equation of state (EoS) and composition of dense and hot Delta-resonance admixed hypernuclear matter is studied under conditions that are characteristic of neutron star binary merger remnants and supernovas. The cold, neutrino free regime is also considered as a reference for the astrophysical constraints on the EoS of dense matter. Our formalism uses the covariant density functional (CDF) theory successfully adapted to include the full JP=1/2plus baryon octet and non-strange members of JP=3/2plus decouplet with density-dependent couplings that have been suitably adjusted to the existing laboratory and astrophysical data in the nuclear and hypernuclear sectors. The effect of Delta-resonances at finite temperatures is to soften the EoS of hypernuclear matter at intermediate densities and stiffen it at high densities. At low temperatures, the heavy baryons  appear in the given order if the Delta-meson couplings are close to those for the nucleon-meson couplings. As is the case for hyperons, the thresholds of Delta-resonances move to lower densities with the increase of temperature indicating a significant fraction of Deltas in the low-density subnuclear regime. We find that the Detla-resonances comprise a significant fraction of baryonic matter, of the order of 10\% at temperatures of the order of several tens of MeV in the neutrino-trapped regime and, thus, may affect the supernova and binary neutron star dynamics.

title: Coherence of ion cyclotron resonance for damping ion cyclotron waves in space plasmas
authors: Qiaowen Luo, Xingyu Zhu, Jiansen He, Jun Cui, Hairong Lai, Daniel Verscharen, Die Duan
topic: Ion cyclotron resonance is one of the fundamental energy conversion processes through field-particle interaction in collisionless plasmas. However, the key evidence for ion cyclotron resonance (i.e., the coherence between electromagnetic fields and the ion phase space density) and the resulting damping of ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) has not yet been directly observed. Investigating the high-quality measurements of space plasmas by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) satellites, we find that both the wave electromagnetic field vectors and the bulk velocity of the disturbed ion velocity distribution rotate around the background magnetic field. Moreover, we find that the absolute gyro-phase angle difference between the center of the fluctuations in the ion velocity distribution functions and the wave electric field vectors falls in the range of (0, 90) degrees, consistent with the ongoing energy conversion from wave-fields to particles. By invoking plasma kinetic theory, we demonstrate that the field-particle correlation for the damping ion cyclotron waves in our theoretical model matches well with our observations. Furthermore, the wave electric field vectors (), the ion current density () and the energy transfer rate () exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations, and the integrated work done by the electromagnetic field on the ions are positive, indicates that ions are mainly energized by the perpendicular component of the electric field via cyclotron resonance. Therefore, our combined analysis of MMS observations and kinetic theory provides direct, thorough, and comprehensive evidence for ICW damping in space plasmas.

authors: Mauro Mariani, Lucas Tonetto, M. Camila Rodríguez, Marcos O. Celi, Ignacio F. Ranea-Sandoval, Milva G. Orsaria, Aurora Pérez Martínez
topic: We model neutron stars as magnetised hybrid stars with an abrupt hadron-quark phase transition in their cores, taking into account current constraints from nuclear experiments and multi-messenger observations. We include magnetic field effects considering the Landau level quantisation of charged particles and the anomalous magnetic moment of neutral particles. We construct the magnetised hybrid equation of state, and we compute the particle population, the matter magnetisation and the transverse and parallel pressure components. We integrate the stable stellar models, considering the dynamical stability for \emph{rapid} or \emph{slow} hadron-quark phase conversion. Finally, we calculate the frequencies and damping times of the fundamental and g non-radial oscillation modes. The latter, a key mode to learn about phase transitions in compact objects, is only obtained for stars with slow conversions. For low magnetic fields, we find that one of the objects of the GW170817 binary system might be a hybrid star belonging to the slow extended stability branch. For magnetars, we find that a stronger magnetic field always softens the hadronic equation of state. Besides, only for some parameter combinations a stronger magnetic field implies a higher hybrid star maximum mass. Contrary to previous results, the incorporation of anomalous magnetic moment does not affect the studied astrophysical quantities. We discuss possible imprints of the microphysics of the equation of state that could be tested observationally in the future, and that might help infer the nature of dense matter and hybrid stars.

title: 3D RMHD simulations of jet-wind interactions in High Mass X-ray Binaries
authors: J. López-Miralles, M. Perucho, J. M. Martí, S. Migliari, V. Bosch-Ramon
topic: The interaction of jets in High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) with the strong winds driven by the hot companion star in the vicinity of the compact object is fundamental to understand the jet dynamics, non-thermal emission and long-term stability. However, the role of the jet magnetic field in this process is unclear. We study the dynamical role of weak and moderate-to-strong toroidal magnetic fields during the first hundreds of seconds of jet propagation, focusing on the magnetized flow dynamics and the mechanisms of energy conversion. We have developed the code Lóstrego v1.0, a new 3D RMHD code to simulate astrophysical plasmas in Cartesian coordinates. Using this tool, we performed the first 3D RMHD numerical simulations of relativistic magnetized jets propagating through the clumpy stellar wind in a HMXB. The overall morphology and dynamics of weakly magnetized jet models is similar to previous hydrodynamical simulations, where the jet head generates a strong shock in the ambient medium and the initial over-pressure with respect to the stellar wind drives one or more recollimation shocks. In the time scales of our simulations, these jets are ballistic and seem to be more stable against internal instabilities than jets with the same power in the absence of fields. However, moderate-to-strong toroidal magnetic fields favour the development of current-driven instabilities and the disruption of the jet within the binary. A detailed analysis of the energy distribution in the relativistic outflow and the ambient medium reveals that both magnetic and internal energies can contribute to the effective acceleration of the jet. We certify that the jet feedback into the ambient medium is highly dependent on the jet energy distribution at injection, where hotter, more dilute and/or more magnetized jets are more efficient, as anticipated by feedback studies in the case of jets in active galaxies.

topic: Fast radio bursts are brief, intense flashes of radio waves that arise from unknown sources in galaxies across the universe. Observations of the polarization properties in repeating fast radio bursts have shown they can reside in highly magnetized environments, such as in the immediate vicinity of a recent supernova or massive black hole. We have observed the actively repeating FRB 20190520B over a span of fourteen months and found that its Faraday rotation measure is both large in magnitude and rapidly varying, including two sign changes which indicate time-dependent orientation changes of the magnetic field along our line of sight. The FRB also depolarizes rapidly at lower frequencies. These phenomena can be explained in terms of multi-path propagation through a highly turbulent, dense magnetized screen within a range of 8 AU to 100 pc away from the FRB source, distinctly narrowing the possible physical configurations that could give rise to the emission seen in FRB 20190520B.

title: Radio Signals from Axion Star-Neutron Star Binaries
authors: Chris Kouvaris, Tao Liu, Kun-Feng Lyu
topic: Axion stars could form binaries with neutron stars. Given the extremely strong external magnetic field exhibited by individual neutron stars, there can be a substantial conversion of axions to photons in these binaries. The photon emission is doubly modulated due to the neutron star spinning and the axion star orbiting, yielding a unique discovery signal. Similar features are also generated in binaries between a neutron star and an axion-clouded black hole. Encouragingly, such binaries are found to be within the reach of ongoing and upcoming experiments (e.g., the Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope and the future Square Kilometer Array) for certain parameter regions. They thus provide a promising astronomical laboratory for detecting axions and axion dark matter.

title: Probing neutron stars with the full pre-merger and post-merger gravitational wave signal from binary coalescences
authors: Marcella Wijngaarden, Katerina Chatziioannou, Andreas Bauswein, James A. Clark, Neil J. Cornish
topic: The gravitational wave signal emitted during the coalescence of two neutron stars carries information about the stars' internal structure. During the long inspiral phase the main matter observable is the tidal interaction between the binary components, an effect that can be parametrically modeled with compact-binary solutions to General Relativity. After the binary merger the main observable is frequency modes of the remnant, most commonly giving rise to a short-duration signal accessible only through numerical simulations. The complicated morphology and the decreasing detector sensitivity in the relevant frequencies currently hinder detection of the post-merger signal and motivate separate analyses for the pre-merger and post-merger data. However, planned and ongoing detector improvements could soon put the post-merger signal within reach. In this study we target the whole pre-merger and post-merger signal without an artificial separation at the binary merger. We construct a hybrid analysis that models the inspiral with templates based on analytical calculations and calibrated to numerical relativity and the post-merger signal with a flexible morphology-independent analysis. Applying this analysis to GW170817 we find, as expected, that the post-merger signal remains undetected. We further study simulated signals and find that we can reconstruct the full signal and simultaneously estimate both the pre-merger tidal deformation and the post-merger signal frequency content. Our analysis allows us to study neutron star physics using all the data available and directly test the pre-merger and post-merger signal for consistency thus probing effects such as the onset of the hadron-quark phase transition.

title: Radio Constraints on r-process Nucleosynthesis by Collapsars
authors: K.H. Lee, I. Bartos, A. Cook, A. Corsi, Z. Marka, G.C. Privon, S. Marka
topic: The heaviest elements in the Universe are synthesized through rapid neutron capture (r-process) in extremely neutron rich outflows. Neutron star mergers were established as an important r-process source through the multi-messenger observation of GW170817. Collapsars were also proposed as a potentially major source of heavy elements; however, this is difficult to probe through optical observations due to contamination by other emission mechanisms. Here we present observational constraints on r-process nucleosynthesis by collapsars based on radio follow-up observations of nearby long gamma-ray bursts. We make the hypothesis that late-time radio emission arises from the collapsar wind ejecta responsible for forging r-process elements, and consider the constraints that can be set on this scenario using radio observations of a sample of Swift/BAT GRBs located within 2 Gpc. No radio counterpart was identified in excess of the radio afterglow of the GRBs in our sample, limiting the collapsar r-process contribution to ≲0.2 M⊙ under the models we considered, with constant circum-merger densities giving more stringent constraints. While our results are in tension with collapsars being the majority r-process production sites, the ejecta mass and velocity profile of collapsar winds is not yet well modeled. As such, our results are currently subject to large uncertainties, but further theoretical work could greatly improve them.

title: Mushroom-instability-driven Magnetic Reconnections in Collisionless Relativistic Jets
authors: Tomohisa Kawashima, Seiji Ishiguro, Toseo Moritaka, Ritoku Horiuchi, Kohji Tomisaka
topic: We study the kinetic plasma dynamics in collisionless relativistic jets with velocity shear, by carrying out particle-in-cell simulations in the transverse plane of a jet. It is discovered that intermittent magnetic reconnections (MRs) are driven by Mushroom instability (MI), which is an important kinetic-scale plasma instability in the plasma shear-flows with relativistic bulk speed. We refer to this sequence of kinetic plasma phenomena as "MI-driven MR". The MI-driven MRs intermittently occur with moving the location of the reconnection points from the vicinity of the initial velocity-shear surface towards the center of the jet. As a consequence, the number density of high energy electrons, which are accelerated by MI-driven MRs, increases with time in the region inside the initial velocity-shear surface with accompanying the generation and subsequent amplification of magnetic fields by MI. The maximum Lorentz factor of electrons increases with initial bulk Lorentz factor of the jet. A possible relation of MI-driven MR to the bright synchrotron emission in jet-spine of active galactic nucleus jets is also discussed.

title: High-accuracy high-mass ratio simulations for binary neutron stars and their comparison to existing waveform models
authors: Maximiliano Ujevic, Alireza Rashti, Henrique Gieg, Wolfgang Tichy, Tim Dietrich
topic: The subsequent observing runs of the advanced gravitational-wave detector network will likely provide us with various gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star systems. For an accurate interpretation of these detections, we need reliable gravitational-wave models. To test and to point out how existing models could be improved, we perform a set of high-resolution numerical-relativity simulations for four different physical setups with mass ratios q = 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, and total gravitational mass M=2.7Msun . Each configuration is simulated with five different resolutions to allow a proper error assessment. Overall, we find approximately 2nd order converging results for the dominant (2,2), but also subdominant (2,1), (3,3), (4,4) modes, while, generally, the convergence order reduces slightly for an increasing mass ratio. Our simulations allow us to validate waveform models, where we find generally good agreement between state-of-the-art models and our data, and to prove that scaling relations for higher modes currently employed for binary black hole waveform modeling also apply for the tidal contribution. Finally, we also test if the current NRTidal model to describe tidal effects is a valid description for high-mass ratio systems. We hope that our simulation results can be used to further improve and test waveform models in preparation for the next observing runs.

title: NLTE Effects on Kilonova Expansion Opacities
authors: Quentin Pognan, Anders Jerkstrand, Jon Grumer
topic: A binary neutron star merger produces a rapidly evolving transient known as a kilonova (KN), which peaks a few days after merger. Modelling of KNe has often been approached assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions in the ejecta. We present the first analysis of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) level populations, using the spectral synthesis code SUMO, and compare these to LTE values. We investigate the importance of the radiation field by conducting NLTE excitation calculations with and without radiative transfer. Level populations, in particular higher lying ones, start to show deviations from LTE a few days after merger. Excitation is lower in NLTE for the majority of ions and states, and this tends to give lower expansion opacities. While the difference is small for the first few days, it grows to factors 2-10 after this. Our results are important both for demonstrating validity of LTE expansion opacities for an initial phase (few days), while highlighting the need for NLTE modelling during later phases. Considering also NLTE ionisation, our results indicate that NLTE can give both higher or lower opacities, depending on composition and wavelength, sometimes by orders of magnitudes.

Cosmic rays play an important role in multi-messenger astronomy and, for this reason, it is important to deepen the study of their sources and to understand the mechanisms behind their acceleration in astronomical environments.

topic: We present coordinated observations of GRB 170202A carried out by the Zadko and the Virgin Island Robotic Telescopes. The observations started 59s after the event trigger, and provided nearly continuous coverage for two days due to the unique location of these telescopes. We clearly detected an early rise in optical emission, followed by late optical flares. By complementing these data with archival observations, we show GRB 170202A is well described by the standard fireball model if multiple reverse shocks are taken into account. Its fireball is evidenced to expand within a constant density interstellar medium, with most burst parameters consistent with the usual ranges found in literature. The electron and magnetic energy parameters (\epsilon_e, \epsilon_B) are orders of magnitude smaller than commonly assumed values. We argue that the global fit of the fireball model achieved by our study should be possible for any burst, pending the availability of a sufficiently comprehensive data set. This conclusion emphasizes the crucial importance of coordinated observation campaigns of GRBs, such as the one central to this work, to answer outstanding questions about the underlying physics driving these phenomena.

title: Entropy-limited higher-order central scheme for neutron star merger simulations
authors: Georgios Doulis, Florian Atteneder, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Bernd Brügmann
topic: Numerical relativity simulations are the only way to calculate exact gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers and to design templates for gravitational-wave astronomy. The accuracy of these numerical calculations is critical in quantifying tidal effects near merger that are currently one of the main sources of uncertainty in merger waveforms. In this work, we explore the use of an entropy-based flux-limiting scheme for high-order, convergent simulations of neutron star spacetimes. The scheme effectively tracks the stellar surface and physical shocks using the residual of the entropy equation thus allowing the use of unlimited central flux schemes in regions of smooth flow. We perform the first neutron star merger simulations with such a method and demonstrate up to fourth-order convergence in the gravitational waveform phase. The scheme reduces the phase error up to a factor five when compared to state-of-the-art high-order characteristic schemes and can be employed for producing faithful tidal waveforms for gravitational-wave modelling.

title: VETTAM: A scheme for radiation hydrodynamics with adaptive mesh refinement using the variable Eddington tensor method
authors: Shyam H. Menon, Christoph Federrath, Mark R. Krumholz, Rolf Kuiper, Benjamin D. Wibking, Manuel Jung
topic: We present Variable Eddington Tensor-closed Transport on Adaptive Meshes (\texttt{VETTAM}), a new algorithm to solve the equations of radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) with support for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in a frequency-integrated, two-moment formulation. The method is based on a non-local Variable Eddington Tensor (VET) closure computed with a hybrid characteristics scheme for ray tracing. We use a Godunov method for the hyperbolic transport of radiation with an implicit backwards-Euler temporal update to avoid the explicit timestep constraint imposed by the light-crossing time, and a fixed-point Picard iteration scheme to handle the nonlinear gas-radiation exchange term, with the two implicit update stages jointly iterated to convergence. We also develop a modified wave-speed correction method for AMR, which we find to be crucial for obtaining accurate results in the diffusion regime. We demonstrate the robustness of our scheme with a suite of pure radiation and RHD tests, and show that it successfully captures the streaming, static diffusion, and dynamic diffusion regimes and the spatial transitions between them, casts sharp shadows, and yields accurate results for rates of momentum and energy exchange between radiation and gas. A comparison between different closures for the radiation moment equations, with the Eddington approximation (0th-moment closure) and the M1 approximation (1st-moment closure), demonstrates the advantages of the VET method (2nd-moment closure) over the simpler closure schemes. \texttt{VETTAM} has been coupled to the AMR \texttt{FLASH} (magneto-)hydrodynamics code and we summarize by reporting performance features and bottlenecks of our implementation.

title: Can a binary neutron star merger in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole enable a detection of a post-merger gravitational wave signal?
authors: Aditya Vijaykumar, Shasvath J. Kapadia, Parameswaran Ajith
topic: The postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) signal of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger is expected to contain valuable information that could shed light on the equation of state (EOS) of NSs, the properties of the matter produced during the merger, as well as the nature of any potential intermediate merger product such as hypermassive or supramassive NSs. However, the postmerger lies in the high frequency regime (1000 Hz) where current LIGO-Virgo detectors are insensitive. While proposed detectors such as NEMO, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope could potentially detect the postmerger for BNSs within (10 Mpc), such events are likely to be rare. In this work, we speculate on the possibility of detecting the postmerger from BNSs coalescing in the vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBH). The redshift produced by the gravitational field of the SMBH, as well as the BNS's proper motion around the SMBH, could effectively "stretch" the postmerger signal into the band of the detectors. We demonstrate, using a phenomenological model, that such BNS coalescences would enable constraints on the peak of the postmerger signal that would otherwise have not been possible, provided the degree of redshifting due to the SMBH can be independently acquired. We further show how such mergers would improve EOS model selection using the postmerger signal. We discuss the mechanisms that might deliver such events, and the limitations of this work.

title: Misaligned Spinning Binary Black Hole Mergers in Hot Magnetized Plasma
authors: Federico Cattorini, Sofia Maggioni, Bruno Giacomazzo, Francesco Haardt, Monica Colpi, Stefano Covino
topic: We present general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of equal-mass spinning black hole binary mergers embedded in a magnetized gas cloud. We focus on the effect of the spin orientation relative to the orbital angular momentum on the flow dynamics, mass accretion rate and Poynting luminosity. We find that, across the inspiral, the gas accreting onto the individual black holes concentrates into disk-like overdensities, whose angular momenta are oriented towards the spin axes and which persist until merger. We identify quasi-periodic modulations occurring in the mass accretion rate at the level of 1-20\%, evolving in parallel with the gravitational wave chirp. The similarity between the accretion rate time-series and the gravitational strain is a consequence of the interplay between strong, dynamical gravitational fields and magnetic fields in the vicinity of the inspiralling black holes. This result suggests that quasi-periodicity in the pre-merger accretion rate of massive binaries is not exclusive of environments in which the black holes are embedded in a circumbinary accretion disk, and could provide an additional useful signature of electromagnetic emission concurrent to low-frequency gravitational wave detection.

authors: Aretaios Lalakos, Ore Gottlieb, Nick Kaaz, Koushik Chatterjee, Matthew Liska, Ian M. Christie, Alexander Tchekhovskoy, Irina Zhuravleva, Elena Nokhrina
topic: X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs) produce misaligned X-shaped jet pairs and make up 10\% of radio galaxies. XRGs are thought to emerge in galaxies featuring a binary supermassive black hole (SMBH), SMBH merger, or large-scale ambient medium asymmetry. We demonstrate that XRG morphology can naturally form without such special, preexisting conditions. Our 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation for the first time follows magnetized rotating gas from outside the SMBH sphere of influence of radius RB to the SMBH of gravitational radius Rg, at the largest scale separation RB/Rg=103 to date. Initially, our axisymmetric system of constant-density hot gas contains weak vertical magnetic field and rotates in an equatorial plane of a rapidly spinning SMBH. We seed the gas with small-scale 2\%-level pressure perturbations. Infalling gas forms an accretion disk, and the SMBH launches relativistically-magnetized collimated jets reaching well outside RB. Under the pressure of the infalling gas, the jets intermittently turn on and off, erratically wobble, and inflate pairs of cavities in different directions, resembling an X-shaped jet morphology. Synthetic X-ray images reveal multiple pairs of jet-powered shocks and cavities. Large-scale magnetic flux accumulates on the SMBH, becomes dynamically important, and leads to a magnetically arrested disk state. The SMBH accretes at 2\% of the Bondi rate and launches twin jets at 150% efficiency. These jets are powerful enough to escape along the spin axis and end the short-lived jets state whose transient nature can account for the rarity of XRGs

title: Spectral sirens: cosmology from the full mass distribution of compact binaries
authors: Jose María Ezquiaga, Daniel E. Holz
topic: We explore the use of the mass spectrum of neutron stars and black holes in gravitational-wave compact binary sources as a cosmological probe. These standard siren sources provide direct measurements of luminosity distance. In addition, features in the mass distribution, such as mass gaps or peaks, will redshift, and thus provide independent constraints on their redshift distribution. We argue that the mass spectrum of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA events introduces at least five independent mass "features": the upper and lower edges of the pair instability supernova (PISN) gap, the upper and lower edges of the neutron star-black hole gap, and the minimum neutron star mass. We find that the PISN gap dominates the cosmological inference with current detectors (2G), as shown in previous work. We further argue that the lower mass gap will provide the most powerful constraints in the era of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope (3G). We demonstrate that degeneracies between redshift evolution of the source masses and cosmology can be broken, unless an astrophysical conspiracy shifts all features of the full mass distribution simultaneously following the (non-trivial) Hubble diagram evolution. We find that this "spectral siren" method has the potential to constrain both cosmology and the evolution of the mass distribution, with 2G achieving better than 10\% precision on H(z) at z less1 within a year,

title: Magnetic support for neutrino-driven explosion of 3D non-rotating core-collapse supernova models
authors: Jin Matsumoto, Yuta Asahina, Tomoya Takiwaki, Kei Kotake, Hiroyuki R. Takahashi
topic: The impact of the magnetic field on the postbounce supernova dynamics of non-rotating stellar cores is studied by performing three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations with spectral neutrino transport. We compare the explodability between initially strongly and weakly magnetized models of 20 and 27 Ms pre-supernova progenitors. We find that although the efficiency for the conversion of the neutrino heating into the turbulent energy including magnetic fields in the gain region is not significantly different between the strong and weak field models, the amplified magnetic field due to the neutrino-driven convection on large hot bubbles just behind a stalled shock leads to the faster and more energetic explosion in the strongly magnetized models. In addition, by comparing the difference between 2nd- and 5th-order spatial accuracy of the simulation in the strong field model for 27 Ms progenitor, we also find that the higher-order accuracy in space is positive for the explosion because it enhances the growth of neutrino-driven convection in the gain region. A new possibility of the origin of the magnetic field of the proto-neutron star (PNS) is proposed based on our results of core-collapse supernova simulations for the non-rotating model. The magnetic field is accumulated and amplified to the magnetar level, that is, (1014) G, in the convectively stable shell in the vicinity of the PNS surface.

These include high-field rotation-powered pulsars, X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDIN), and magnetars. In such ultra-strong fields, quantum effects in physical processes as well as additional exotic Quantum Electrodynamic processes only occurring at these high field strengths have a significant influence on the emitted radiation. Although very strong magnetic fields play a critical role both inside and outside of neutron stars, I will review primarily processes that operate in the neutron star magnetospheres and how they influence the observed radiation.

title: Magnetic Field Evolution in the Crust of Neutron Stars: Crust Failure and Plastic Flow
authors: Konstantinos N. Gourgouliatos
topic: The evolution of the magnetic field in neutron star crusts because of the Hall effect has received significant attention over the last two decades, which is strongly justified because of the dominance of this effect in highly magnetised neutron stars. However, the applicability of the Hall effect is based on the assumption that the crust does not fail and sustains its rigidity. This assumption can be violated for substantially strong magnetic fields. If this is the case, the evolution of the magnetic field is described by a different set of equations, which include the effects of a non-rigid crust. In this talk, after a brief review of the main characteristic of the Hall evolution, I will discuss the impact a plastic flow of the crust has on the magnetic field, studying axisymmetric models. Moreover, the way the crust fails impacts the overall evolution, with major differences appearing if the failure is local, intermediate or global. Quite remarkably, crustal failure and plasticity do not annul the Hall effect, and under certain circumstances they may even lead to a more dramatic evolution. I will discuss the impact of these effects in the context of neutron star timing behaviour, with special focus on timing noise, outbursts and glitches.

title: Neutrinos from Gamma-ray Bursts
authors: Shigeo S. Kimura
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous electromagnetic burst in the Universe. They occur when a rapidly rotating massive star collapses or a binary neutron star merges. These events leave a newborn central compact object, either a black hole or neutron star, which launches relativistic jets that emit the luminous gamma-ray signals. These jets can accelerate non-thermal protons, which are expected to produce high-energy neutrinos via photohadronic interactions. This Chapter briefly summarizes the current physical picture of GRBs, and discusses neutrino emissions from GRBs, including both prompt and afterglow phases. Neutrinos from sub-classes of GRBs, including low-luminosity GRBs and short GRBs, are also discussed.

title: Pasta phases in neutron stars under strong magnetic fields
authors: Xiaopeng Wang, Jing Li, Jianjun Fang, Helena Pais, Constança Providência
topic: In the present work, we consider nuclear matter in the innermost crust of neutron stars under the presence of a strong magnetic field within the framework of a relativistic mean-field description. Two models with a different slope of the symmetry energy are considered in order to discuss the density-dependence of the equation of state on the crust structure. The non-homogeneous matter in beta-equilibrium is described within the coexisting phases method, and the effect of including the anomalous magnetic moment is discussed. Five different geometries for the pasta structures are considered. It is shown that strong magnetic fields cause an extension of the inner crust of the neutron stars, with the occurrence of a series of disconnected non-homogeneous matter regions above the one existing for a null magnetic field. Moreover, we observed that in these disconnected regions, for some values of the magnetic field, all five different cluster geometrical shapes occur, and the gas density is close to the cluster density. Also, the pressure at the neutron star crust-core transition much larger than the pressure obtained for a zero magnetic field. Another noticeable effect of the presence of strong magnetic fields is the increase of the proton fraction, favoring the appearance of protons in the gas background.

title: The mechanism of efficient electron acceleration at parallel non-relativistic shocks
authors: Mohamad Shalaby, Rouven Lemmerz, Timon Thomas, Christoph Pfrommer
topic: Thermal electrons cannot directly participate in the process of diffusive acceleration at electron-ion shocks because their Larmor radii are smaller than the shock transition width: this is the well-known electron injection problem of diffusive shock acceleration. Instead, an efficient pre-acceleration process must exist that scatters electrons off of electromagnetic fluctuations on scales much shorter than the ion gyro radius. The recently found intermediate-scale instability provides a natural way to produce such fluctuations in parallel shocks. The instability drives comoving (with the upstream plasma) ion-cyclotron waves at the shock front and only operates when the drift speed is smaller than half of the electron Alfven speed. Here, we perform particle-in-cell simulations with the SHARP code to study the impact of this instability on electron acceleration at parallel non-relativistic, electron-ion shocks. To this end, we compare a shock simulation in which the intermediate-scale instability is expected to grow to simulations where it is suppressed. In particular, the simulation with an Alfvenic Mach number large enough to quench the intermediate instability shows a great reduction (by two orders of magnitude) of the electron acceleration efficiency. Moreover, the simulation with a reduced ion-to-electron mass ratio (where the intermediate instability is also suppressed) not only artificially precludes electron acceleration but also results in erroneous electron and ion heating in the downstream and shock transition regions. This finding opens up a promising route for a plasma physical understanding of diffusive shock acceleration of electrons, which necessarily requires realistic mass ratios in simulations of collisionless electron-ion shocks.

title: Inferring the neutron star maximum mass and lower mass gap in neutron star-black hole systems with spin
authors: Christine Ye, Maya Fishbach
topic: Gravitational-wave (GW) detections of merging neutron star-black hole (NSBH) systems probe astrophysical neutron star (NS) and black hole (BH) mass distributions, especially at the transition between NS and BH masses. Of particular interest are the maximum NS mass, minimum BH mass, and potential mass gap between them. While previous GW population analyses assumed all NSs obey the same maximum mass, if rapidly spinning NSs exist, they can extend to larger maximum masses than nonspinning NSs. In fact, several authors have proposed that the 2.6Msun object in the event GW190814 -- either the most massive NS or least massive BH observed to date -- is a rapidly spinning NS. We therefore infer the NSBH mass distribution jointly with the NS spin distribution, modeling the NS maximum mass as a function of spin. Using 4 LIGO-Virgo NSBH events including GW190814, if we assume that the NS spin distribution is uniformly distributed up to the maximum (breakup) spin, we infer the maximum non-spinning NS mass is 2.7+0.5-0.4Msun (90\% credibility), while assuming only nonspinning NSs, the NS maximum mass must be 2.53Msun (90\% credibility). The data support the mass gap's existence, with a minimum BH mass at 5.4+0.7-1.0Msun. With future observations, under simplified assumptions, 150 NSBH events may constrain the maximum nonspinning NS mass to 0.02Msun, and we may even measure the relation between the NS spin and maximum mass entirely from GW data. If rapidly rotating NSs exist, their spins and masses must be modeled simultaneously to avoid biasing the NS maximum mass.

title: Dynamical tides in superfluid neutron stars
authors: Andrea Passamonti, Nils Andersson, Pantelis Pnigouras
topic: We study the tidal response of a superfluid neutron star in a binary system, focussing on Newtonian models with superfluid neutrons present throughout the star's core and the inner crust. Within the two-fluid formalism, we consider the main aspects that arise from the presence of different regions inside the star, with particular focus on the various interfaces. Having established the relevant theory, we determine the tidal excitation of the most relevant oscillation modes during binary inspiral. Our results suggest that superfluid physics has a negligible impact on the static tidal deformation. The overwhelming contribution to the Love number is given by, as for normal matter stars, the ordinary fundamental mode (f-mode). Strong entrainment, here described by a phenomenological expression which mimics the large effective neutron mass expected at the bottom of the crust, is shown to have significant impact on the superfluid modes, but our results for the dynamical tide are nevertheless similar to the static limit: the fundamental modes are the ones most significantly excited by the tidal interaction, with the ordinary f-mode dominating the superfluid one. We also discuss the strain built up in the star's crust during binary inspiral, showing that the superfluid f-mode may (depending on entrainment) reach the limit where the crust breaks, although it does so after the ordinary f-mode. Overall, our results suggest that the presence of superfluidity may be difficult to establish from binary neutron star gravitational-wave signals.

topic: The electron beam Weibel instability in the electrostatic collisionless shock is studied via particle in cell simulation. When the non-relativistic incoming plasmas collide with cold dilute plasmas, an electrostatic shock forms near the interface. Following that, a filamentary out-of-plane magnetic field is formed as a result of the Weibel instability. It is demonstrated that the anisotropy of incoming hot electrons is insufficient to trigger the Weibel instability. And the Weibel instability is excited by cold electrons in dilute plasmas. After being accelerated to relativistic velocities by the shock electric field into the dense plasmas, electrons in the dilute plasma have considerable anisotropy and can trigger the Weibel instability

topic: Neutron stars are a remarkable marriage of Einstein's theory of general relativity with nuclear physics. Their interiors harbor extreme matter that cannot be probed in the laboratory. At such high densities and pressures, their cores may consist predominantly of exotic matter such as free quarks or hyperons. Gravitational wave observations from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and from other interferometers, and X-ray observations from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), are beginning to pierce through the veil. These observations provide information about neutron star cores, and therefore, about the physics that makes such objects possible. In this review, we discuss what we have learned about the physics of neutron stars from gravitational wave and X-ray observations. We focus on what has been observed with certainty and what should be observable in the near future, with an eye out for the physics that these new observations will teach us.

title: A blast from the infant Universe: the very high-z GRB 210905A

topic: We present the discovery of the very energetic GRB 210905A at the high redshift z=6.312 and its luminous X-ray and optical afterglow. We obtained photometric and spectroscopic follow-up in the optical and near-infrared (NIR), covering both the prompt and afterglow emission from a few minutes up to 7.5 Ms after burst. With an isotropic gamma-ray energy of Eiso=1.27x10^54erg, GRB 210905A lies in the top 7 GRBs in terms of energy released. Its afterglow is among the most luminous ever observed and, in particular, it is one of the most luminous in the optical at t \l 0.5 d, in the rest frame. The afterglow starts with a shallow evolution that can be explained by energy injection, and is followed by a steeper decay, while the spectral energy distribution is in agreement with slow cooling in a constant-density environment within the standard fireball theory. A jet break at 39\pm 21 d has been observed in the X-ray light curve; however, it is hidden in the H-band, potentially due to a constant contribution from an unknown component, most likely a foreground intervening galaxy and/or the host galaxy. We derived a half-opening angle of 7.9+-1.6 degrees, the highest ever measured for a z \g 6 burst but within the range covered by closer events. The resulting collimation-corrected gamma-ray energy of 10^52erg is also among the highest ever measured. The moderately large half-opening angle argues against recent claims of an inverse dependence of the half-opening angle on the redshift. The total jet energy is likely too large for a standard magnetar, and suggests that the central engine of this burst was a newly formed black hole. Despite the outstanding energetics and luminosity of both GRB 210905A and its afterglow, we demonstrate that they are consistent within 2swith those of less distant bursts, indicating that the powering mechanisms and progenitors do not evolve significantly with redshift.

title: PRAiSE: Resolved spectral evolution in simulated radio sources
authors: Patrick M. Yates-Jones, Ross J. Turner, Stanislav S. Shabala, Martin G. H. Krause
topic: We present a method for applying spatially resolved adiabatic and radiative loss processes to synthetic radio emission from hydrodynamic simulations of radio sources from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Lagrangian tracer particles, each representing an ensemble of electrons, are injected into simulations and the position, grid pressure, and time since the last strong shock are recorded. These quantities are used to track the losses of the electron packet through the radio source in a manner similar to the Radio AGN in Semi-analytic Environments (RAiSE) formalism, which uses global source properties to calculate the emissivity of each particle ex-situ. Freedom in the choice of observing parameters, including redshift, is provided through the post-processing nature of this approach. We apply this framework to simulations of jets in different environments, including asymmetric ones. We find a strong dependence of radio source properties on frequency and redshift, in good agreement with observations and previous modelling work. There is a strong evolution of radio spectra with redshift due to the more prominent inverse-Compton losses at high redshift. Radio sources in denser environments have flatter spectral indices, suggesting that spectral index asymmetry may be a useful environment tracer. We simulate intermediate Mach number jets that disrupt before reaching the tip of the lobe, and find that these retain an edge-brightened Fanaroff-Riley Type II morphology, with the most prominent emission remaining near the tip of the lobes for all environments and redshifts we study.

title: Stripped-envelope supernova light-curve bumps caused by variable thermal energy injection from magnetar spin down
authors: Takashi J. Moriya, Kohta Murase, Kazumi Kashiyama, Sergei I. Blinnikov
topic: Luminosity evolution of some stripped-envelope supernovae such as superluminous supernovae is difficult to be explained by the canonical 56Ni nuclear decay heating. A popular alternative heating source is rapid spin down of strongly-magnetized rapidly-rotating neutron stars (magnetars) and it has been shown that magnetar spin down can explain luminosity evolution of superluminous supernovae. Recent observations have indicated that superluminous supernovae often have bumpy light curves with multiple luminosity peaks. The cause of bumpy light curves is still unknown. In this study, we investigate the possibility that the light-curve bumps are caused by variabilities in the thermal energy injection from magnetar spin down. We find that a temporal increase in the thermal energy injection can lead to multiple luminosity peaks. The multiple luminosity peaks caused by the variable thermal energy injection is found to be accompanied by significant photospheric temperature increase, and photospheric radii are not significantly changed. We show that the bumpy light curves of SN 2015bn and SN 2019stc can be reproduced by temporarily increasing magnetar spin-down energy input by a factor of 2-3 for 5-20 days. However, not all the light-curve bumps are accompanied by the clear photospheric temperature increase as predicted by our synthetic models. In particular, the secondary light-curve bump of SN 2019stc is accompanied by a temporal increase in photospheric radii rather than temperature, which is not seen in our synthetic models. We, therefore, conclude that not all the light-curve bumps observed in luminous supernovae are caused by the variable thermal energy injection from magnetar spin down and some bumps are likely caused by a different mechanism. Our study demonstrates the importance of photosphere information to identify the cause of the bumpy light curves.

title: Kinetic Simulation on Electron, Proton and Helium Acceleration in a Nonrelativistic Quasiparallel shock
authors: Jun Fang, Qi Xia, Shiting Tian, Liancheng Zhou, Huan Yu
topic: In addition to electrons and protons, nonrelativistic quasiparallel shocks are expected to possess the ability to accelerate heavy ions. The shocks in supernova remnants are generally supposed to be accelerators of the Galactic cosmic rays, which consist of many species of particles. We investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of electrons, protons and helium ions in a nonrelativistic quasiparallel shock through 1D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation with a helium-to-proton number density ratio of 0.1, which is relevant for the Galactic cosmic rays. The simulation indicates that waves can be excited by the flow of the energetic protons and helium ions upstream of the nonrelativistic quasiparallel shock with a sonic Mach number of 18 and an alfven Mach number of 16.5 in the shock rest frame, and the charged particles are scattered by the self-generated waves and accelerated gradually. Moreover, the spectra of the charged particles downstream of the shock are thermal plus a nonthermal tail, and the acceleration is efficient with about 7% and 5.4% of the bulk kinetic energy transferred into the nonthermal protons and helium ions in the near downstream region at the end of the simulation, respectively.

title: Investigating the detection rates and inference of gravitational-wave and radio emission from black hole neutron star mergers
authors: Oliver M. Boersma, Joeri van Leeuwen
topic: Black hole neutron star (BHNS) mergers have recently been detected through their gravitational-wave (GW) emission. BHNS mergers could also produce electromagnetic (EM) emission as a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB), and/or an sGRB afterglow upon interaction with the circummerger medium. Here, we make predictions for the expected detection rates with the Square Kilometre Array Phase 1 (SKA1) of sGRB radio afterglows associated with BHNS mergers. We also investigate the benefits of a multimessenger analysis in inferring the properties of the merging binary. We simulate a population of BHNS mergers and estimate their sGRB afterglow flux to obtain the detection rates with SKA1. We investigate how this rate depends on the GW detector sensitivity, the primary black hole (BH) spin, and the neutron star equation of state. We then perform a multimessenger Bayesian inference study on a fiducial BHNS merger. We simulate its sGRB afterglow and GW emission and take systematic errors into account. The expected rates of a combined GW and radio detection with the current generation GW detectors are likely low. Due to the much increased sensitivity of future GW detectors like the Einstein Telescope, the chances of an sGRB localisation and radio detection increase substantially. The unknown distribution of the BH spin has a big influence on the detection rates, however, and it is a large source of uncertainty. Furthermore, for our fiducial BHNS merger we are able to infer both the binary source parameters as well as the parameters of the sGRB afterglow simultaneously when combining the GW and radio data. The radio data provides useful extra information on the binary parameters such as the mass ratio but this is limited by the systematic errors involved. A better understanding of the systematics will further increase the amount of information on the binary parameters that can be extracted from this radio data.

title: Microphysics of Relativistic Collisionless Electron-ion-positron Shocks
authors: Daniel Groselj, Lorenzo Sironi, Andrei M. Beloborodov
topic: We perform particle-in-cell simulations to elucidate the microphysics of relativistic weakly magnetized shocks loaded with electron-positron pairs. Various external magnetizations sigma-10-4 and pair-loading factors Zpm 10 are studied, where Zpm is the number of loaded electrons and positrons per ion. We find the following. (1) The shock becomes mediated by the ion Larmor gyration in the mean field when [sigma] exceeds a critical value [sigma]L that decreases with Zpm. At [sigma]\leq[sigma]L the shock is mediated by particle scattering in the self-generated microturbulent fields, the strength and scale of which decrease with Zpm, leading to lower [sigma]L. (2) The energy fraction carried by the post-shock pairs is robustly in the range between 20\% and 50\% of the upstream ion energy. The mean energy per post-shock electron scales as Ee propto (Zpm+1)-1. (3) Pair loading suppresses nonthermal ion acceleration at magnetizations as low as [sigma]=5x10-6. The ions then become essentially thermal with mean energy Ei, while electrons form a nonthermal tail, extending from E-(Zpm+1)-1Ei to Ei. When sigma=0, particle acceleration is enhanced by the formation of intense magnetic cavities that populate the precursor during the late stages of shock evolution. Here, the maximum energy of the nonthermal ions and electrons keeps growing over the duration of the simulation. Alongside the simulations, we develop theoretical estimates consistent with the numerical results. Our findings have important implications for models of early gamma-ray burst afterglows.

title: Thermal effects on tidal deformability in the last orbits of an inspiraling binary neutron star system
authors: A. Kanakis-Pegios, P.S. Koliogiannis, Ch.C. Moustakidis
topic: The study of binary neutron stars mergers by the detection of the emitted gravitational waves is one of the most promised tools to study the properties of dense nuclear matter at high densities. It is worth claiming that, at the moment, strong evidence that the temperature of the stars is zero during the last orbits before coalescing, does not exist. Nevertheless, theoretical studies suggest that the temperature concerning the inspiral phase, could reach even a few MeV. According to the main theory, tides transfer mechanical energy and angular momentum to the star at the expense of the orbit, where friction within the star converts the mechanical energy into heat. During the inspiral, these effects are potentially detectable. Different treatments have been used to estimate the transfer of the mechanical energy and the size of the tidal friction, leading to different conclusions about the importance of pre-merger tidal effects. The present work is dedicated to the study of the effect of temperature on the tidal deformability of neutron stars during the inspiral of a neutron star system just before the merger. We applied a class of hot equations of state, both isothermal and adiabatic, originated from various nuclear models. We found that even for low values of temperature (T\less 1 MeV), the effects on the basic ingredients of tidal deformability are not negligible. On the other hand, in the case of the adiabatic star, the thermal effects on tidal deformability remain imperceptible, up to the value S=0.2 kB. According to the main finding, the effect of the temperature on the tidal deformability is indistinguishable. The consequences of the above result are discussed and analyzed.

title: Modelling the spectra of the kilonova AT2017gfo -- I: The photospheric epochs
authors: J. H. Gillanders, S. J. Smartt, S. A. Sim, A. Bauswein, S. Goriely
topic: The kilonova (KN) associated with the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 is the only known electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave source. Here we produce a sequence of radiative transfer models (using \textsc{tardis}) with updated atomic data, and compare them to accurately calibrated spectra. We use element compositions from nuclear network calculations based on a realistic hydrodynamical simulation of a BNS merger. We show that the blue spectrum at +1.4 days after merger requires a nucleosynthetic trajectory with a high electron fraction. Our best-fitting model is composed entirely of first r-process peak elements (Sr \& Zr) and the strong absorption feature is reproduced well by Sr\,\textsc{ii} absorption. At this epoch, we set an upper limit on the lanthanide mass fraction of XLN=5×10-3. In contrast, all subsequent spectra from +2.4-6.4 days require the presence of a modest amount of lanthanide material (XLN=0.05+0.05-0.02), produced by a trajectory with Ye=0.29. This produces lanthanide-induced line blanketing below 6000\,Å, and sufficient light r-process elements to explain the persistent strong feature at 0.7-1.0\,\micron\ (Sr\,\textsc{ii}). The composition gives good matches to the observed data, indicating that the strong blue flux deficit results in the near-infrared (NIR) excess. The disjoint in composition between the first epoch and all others indicates either ejecta stratification, or the presence of two distinct components of material. This further supports the two-component kilonova model, and constrains the element composition from nucleosynthetic trajectories. The major uncertainties lie in availability of atomic data and the ionisation state of the expanding material.

title: Quasi-normal g-modes of neutron stars with quarks
authors: Tianqi Zhao, Constantinos Constantinou, Prashanth Jaikumar, Madappa Prakash
topic: Quasi-normal oscillation modes of neutron stars provide a means to probe their interior composition using gravitational wave astronomy. We compute the frequencies and damping times of composition-dependent core g-modes of neutron stars containing quark matter employing linearized perturbative equations of general relativity. We find that ignoring background metric perturbations due to the oscillating fluid, as in the Cowling approximation, underestimates the g-mode frequency by up to 10% for higher mass stars, depending on the parameters of the nuclear equation of state and how the mixed phase is constructed. The g-mode frequencies are well-described by a linear scaling with the central lepton (or combined lepton and quark) fraction for nucleonic (hybrid) stars. Our findings suggest that neutron stars with and without quarks are manifestly different with regards to their quasi-normal g-mode spectrum, and may thus be distinguished from one another in future observations of gravitational waves from merging neutron stars.

title: Constraints on the merging binary neutron star mass distribution and equation of state based on the fraction of jets
authors: O. S. Salafia, A. Colombo, F. Gabrielli, I. Mandel
topic: A relativistic jet has been produced in the single well-localised binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected to date in gravitational waves (GWs), and the local rates of BNS mergers and short gamma-ray bursts are of the same order of magnitude. This suggests that jet formation is not a rare outcome for BNS mergers, and we show that this intuition can be turned into a quantitative constraint: at least about 1/3 of GW-detected BNS mergers, and at least about 1/5 of all BNS mergers, should produce a successful jet (90 credible level). Whether a jet is launched depends on the properties of the merger remnant and of the surrounding accretion disc, which in turn are a function of the progenitor binary masses and equation of state (EoS). The fraction of jets in the population therefore carries information about the binary component mass distribution and EoS. Under the assumption that a jet can only be produced by a black hole remnant surrounded by a non-negligible accretion disc, we show how the jet fraction can be used to place a joint constraint on the space of BNS component mass distributions and EoS. The result points to a broad mass distribution, with particularly strong support for masses in the 1.3-1.6Msun range. The constraints on the EoS are shallow, but we show how they will tighten as the knowledge on the jet fraction and mass distribution improve. We also discuss how to extend the method to include future BNS events, with possibly uncertain jet associations.

title: Formulating bulk viscosity for neutron star simulations
authors: T. Celora, I. Hawke, P. C. Hammond, N. Andersson, G. L. Comer
topic: In order to extract the precise physical information encoded in the gravitational and electromagnetic signals from powerful neutron-star merger events, we need to include as much of the relevant physics as possible in our numerical simulations. This presents a severe challenge, given that many of the involved parameters are poorly constrained. In this paper we focus on the role of nuclear reactions. Combining a theoretical discussion with an analysis connecting to state-of-the-art simulations, we outline multiple arguments that lead to a reactive system being described in terms of a bulk viscosity. The results demonstrate that in order to properly account for nuclear reactions, future simulations must be able to handle different regimes where rather different assumptions/approximations are appropriate. We also touch upon the link to models based on the large-eddy-strategy required to capture turbulence.

title: GRB 210217A: A short or a long GRB?
authors: Dimple, Kuntal Misra, Ankur Ghosh, K. G. Arun, Rahul Gupta, Amit Kumar, L. Resmi, S. B. Pandey, Lallan Yadav
topic: Gamma-ray bursts are traditionally classified as short and long bursts based on their T90 value (the time interval during which an instrument observes 5% to 95% of gamma-ray/hard X-ray fluence). However, T90 is dependent on the detector sensitivity and the energy range in which the instrument operates. As a result, different instruments provide different values of T90 for a burst. GRB 210217A is detected with different duration by {\it Swift} and {\it Fermi}. It is classified as a long/soft GRB by {\it Swift}-BAT with a T90 value of 3.76 sec. On the other hand, the sub-threshold detection by {\it Fermi}-GBM classified GRB 210217A as a short/hard burst with a duration of 1.024 sec. We present the multi-wavelength analysis of GRB 210217A (lying in the overlapping regime of long and short GRBs) to identify its actual class using multi-wavelength data. We utilized the T90-hardness ratio, T90-\Ep, and T90-tmvts distributions of the GRBs to find the probability of GRB 210217A being a short GRB. Further, we estimated the photometric redshift of the burst by fitting the joint XRT/UVOT SED and place the burst in the Amati plane. We found that GRB 210217A is an ambiguous burst showing properties of both short and long class of GRBs

title: Compactness bounds in General Relativity
authors: Artur Alho, José Natário, Paolo Pani, Guilherme Raposo
topic: A foundational theorem due to Buchdahl states that, within General Relativity (GR), the maximum compactness C=M/(Rc2) of a static, spherically symmetric, perfect fluid object of mass M and radius R is C=4/9. As a corollary, there exists a compactness gap between perfect fluid stars and black holes (where C=1/2). Here we generalize Buchdahl's result by introducing the most general equation of state for elastic matter with constant longitudinal wave speeds and apply it to compute the maximum compactness of regular, self-gravitating objects in GR. We show that: (i) the maximum compactness grows monotonically with the longitudinal wave speed and with the shear modulus of the material; (ii) elastic matter can exceed Buchdahl's bound and reach the black hole compactness C=1/2 continuously; (iii) however, imposing subluminal wave propagation lowers the maximum compactness bound to C=0.423, which we conjecture to be the maximum compactness of any static elastic object satisfying causality; (iv) imposing also radial stability further decreases the maximum compactness to C=0.376. Therefore, although anisotropies are often invoked as a mechanism for supporting horizonless ultracompact objects, we argue that the black hole compactness cannot be reached with physically reasonable matter within GR and that true black hole mimickers require beyond-GR effects.

title: Are Low-Frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations seen in accretion flows the disk response to a jet instability?
authors: Jonathan Ferreira, Gregoire Marcel, Pierre-Olivier Petrucci, Jerome Rodriguez, Julien Malzac, Renaud Belmont, Maica Clavel, Gilles Henri, Stephane Corbel, Mickael Coriat
topic: Low Frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations or LF QPOs are ubiquitous in BH X-ray binaries and provide strong constraints on the accretion-ejection processes. Although several models have been proposed so far, none has been proven to reproduce all observational constraints and no consensus has emerged yet. We make the conjecture that disks are threaded by a large scale vertical magnetic field that splits it into two radial zones. In the inner Jet Emitting Disk (JED), a near equipartition field allows to drive powerful self-collimated jets, while beyond a transition radius, the disk magnetization is too low and a Standard Accretion Disk (SAD) is settled. In a series of papers, this hybrid JED-SAD disk configuration has been shown to successfully reproduce most multi-wavelength (radio and X-rays) observations, as well as the concurrence with the LFQPOs for the archetypal source GX 339-4. We first analyze the main QPO scenarios provided in the literature: 1) a specific process occurring at the transition radius, 2) the accretion-ejection instability and 3) the solid-body Lense-Thirring disk precession. We recall their main assumptions and shed light on some severe theoretical issues that question the capability to reproduce LF QPOs. We then argue that none of these models could be operating under the JED-SAD physical conditions. We finally propose an alternative scenario where LF QPOs would be the disk response to an instability triggered in the jets, near a magnetic recollimation zone. Such a situation could account for most Type-C QPO phenomenology and is consistent with the global behavior of black hole binaries. The calculation of this non-destructive jet instability remains however to be done. If the existence of this instability is numerically confirmed, then it could also naturally account for the jet wobbling phenomenology seen in various accreting sources.

topic: Following the GRB 170817A prompt emission lasting a fraction of a second, 108 s of data in the X-rays, optical, and radio wavelengths have been acquired. We here present a model that fits the spectra, flux, and time variability of all these emissions, based on the thermal and synchrotron cooling of the expanding matter ejected in a binary white dwarf merger. The 10-3Msun of ejecta, expanding at velocities of 109 cm s-1, are powered by the newborn massive, fast rotating, magnetized white dwarf with a mass of 1.3M⊙, a rotation period of 12 s, and a dipole magnetic field 1010 G, born in the merger of a 1.0-0.8Msun white dwarf binary. Therefore, the long-lasting mystery of the GRB 170817A nature is solved by the merger of a white dwarf binary that also explains the prompt emission energetics.

authors: I. Sfaradi, A. Horesh, R. Fender, D. A. Green, D. R. A. Williams, J. Bright, S. Schulze
topic: We report here radio follow-up observations of the optical Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) AT 2019azh. Previously reported X-ray observations of this TDE showed variability at early times and a dramatic increase in luminosity, by a factor of 10, about 8 months after optical discovery. The X-ray emission is mainly dominated by intermediate hard--soft X-rays and is exceptionally soft around the X-ray peak, which is LX-1043ergs-1. The high cadence 15.5 GHz observations reported here show an early rise in radio emission followed by an approximately constant light curve, and a late-time flare. This flare starts roughly at the time of the observed X-ray peak luminosity and reaches its peak about 110 days after the peak in the X-ray, and a year after optical discovery. The radio flare peaks at [], a factor of two higher than the emission preceding the flare. In light of the late-time radio and X-ray flares, and the X-ray spectral evolution, we speculate a possible transition in the accretion state of this TDE, similar to the observed behavior in black hole X-ray binaries. We compare the radio properties of AT 2019azh to other known TDEs, and focus on the similarities to the late time radio flare of the TDE ASASSN-15oi.

topic: As a way to find analogies and differences in the dynamics of hot and dense matter under extreme conditions, we present the first self-consistent relativistic-hydrodynamic calculations of both neutron-star mergers and low-energy heavy-ion collisions employing the same equation of state. By a direct comparison of the evolution of quantities such as temperature, entropy, and density, we show that neutron-star collision regimes can be probed directly at GSI beam energies. We provide concrete evidence that the physical conditions reached in binary neutron-star mergers can be studied in present and future laboratory experiments, thus bridging 18 orders of magnitude in length scale, from microscopic ion collisions to macroscopic astrophysical compact objects.

title: GRB Emission with Anisotropic Electron Distribution
authors: Ryota Goto, Katsuaki Asano
topic: The typical spectrum of the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) indicates that the electron cooling is suppressed in spite of the strong magnetic field in the standard synchrotron model. Recent Particle-in-Cell simulations show that the particle acceleration by magnetic reconnection in a magnetically dominated plasma can lead to small pitch angles especially in low-energy region. Such a small pitch angle prevents electrons from cooling via synchrotron radiation. In this paper, taking into account the effects of the synchrotron cooling and the adiabatic cooling, we numerically calculate the synchrotron spectra with anisotropic electron distributions. If we require a Poynting flux larger than 1050 erg s-1 as the model is motivated by magnetic reconnection, the bulk Lorentz factor of 1000 and the electron minimum Lorentz factor of γmin-104 are required to reproduce the typical GRB spectrum.

title: Radiative diffusion in a time-dependent outflow: a model for fast blue optical transients
authors: Chun Chen, Rong-Feng Shen
topic: Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs) are luminous transients with fast evolving (typically trise<12 days) light curve and blue color (usually -0.2 > g-r > -0.3) that cannot be explained by a supernova-like explosion. We propose a radiative diffusion in a time-dependent outflow model to interpret such special transients. In this model, we assume a central engine ejects continuous outflow during a few days. We consider the ejection of the outflow to be time-dependent. The outflow is optically thick initially and photons are frozen in it. As the outflow expands over time, photons gradually escape, and our work is to model such an evolution. Numerical and analytical calculations are considered separately, and the results are consistent. We apply the model to three typical FBOTs: PS1-10bjp, ZTF18abukavn, and ATLAS19dqr. The modeling finds the total mass of the outflow (1-5Msun), and the total time of the ejection (a few days) for them, leading us to speculate that they may be the result of the collapse of massive stars.

title: On Dark Gravitational Wave Standard Sirens as Cosmological Inference and Forecasting the Constraint on Hubble Constant using Binary Black Holes Detected by Deci-hertz Observatory
authors: Ju Chen, Changshuo Yan, Youjun Lu, Yuetong Zhao, Junqiang Ge
topic: Gravitational wave (GW) signals from compact binary coalescences can be used as standard sirens to constrain cosmological parameters if their redshift can be measured independently. However, mergers of stellar binary black holes (BBHs) may not have electromagnetic counterparts and thus have no direct redshift measurements. These dark sirens may be still used to statistically constrain cosmological parameters by combining their GW measured luminosity distances and localization with deep redshift surveys of galaxies around it. We investigate this dark siren method in detail by using mock BBH and galaxy samples. We find that the Hubble constant can be constrained well with an accuracy 1\% with a few tens or more of BBH mergers at redshift up to 1 if GW observations can provide accurate estimates of their luminosity distance (with relative error of 0.01) and localization (0.1 deg2), though the constraint may be significantly biased if the luminosity distance and localization errors are larger. We also introduce a simple method to correct this bias and find it is valid when the luminosity distance and localization errors are modestly large. We further generate mock BBH samples, according to current constraints on BBH merger rate and the distributions of BBH properties, and find that the Deci-hertz Observatory (DO) in a half year observation period may detect about one hundred BBHs with signal-to-noise ratio 30, relative luminosity distance error 0.02, and localization error .01deg2. By applying the dark standard siren method, we find that the Hubble constant can be constrained to the 0.1-1% level using these DO BBHs, an accuracy comparable to the constraints obtained by using electromagnetic observations in the near future, thus it may provide insight into the Hubble tension.

title: Conservative finite volume scheme for first-order viscous relativistic hydrodynamics
authors: Alex Pandya, Elias R. Most, Frans Pretorius
topic: We present the first conservative finite volume numerical scheme for the causal, stable relativistic Navier-Stokes equations developed by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK). BDNK theory has arisen very recently as a promising means of incorporating entropy-generating effects (viscosity, heat conduction) into relativistic fluid models, appearing as a possible alternative to the so-called Müller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) theory successfully used to model quark-gluon plasma. Both BDNK and MIS-type theories may be understood in terms of a gradient expansion about the perfect (ideal) fluid, wherein BDNK arises at first order and MIS at second order. As such, BDNK has vastly fewer terms and undetermined model coefficients (as is typical for an effective field theory appearing at lower order), allowing for rigorous proofs of stability, causality, and hyperbolicity in full generality which have as yet been impossible for MIS. To capitalize on these advantages, we present the first fully conservative multi-dimensional fluid solver for the BDNK equations suitable for physical applications. The scheme includes a flux-conservative discretization, non-oscillatory reconstruction, and a central-upwind numerical flux, and is designed to smoothly transition to a high-resolution shock-capturing perfect fluid solver in the inviscid limit. We assess the robustness of our new method in a series of flat-spacetime tests for a conformal fluid, and provide a detailed comparison with previous approaches of Pandya & Pretorius (2021).

title: Contribution to the extragalactic neutrino background from dense environment of GRB jets
authors: W. Bednarek, A. Śmiałkowski
topic: Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are at present well confirmed sites of acceleration of particles to relativistic energies due to observations of gamma-ray emission in the GeV-TeV energy range. We consider a scenario in which the mechanism accelerating electrons is also responsible for acceleration of hadrons in the GRB jets to multi-PeV energies. Since progenitors of long GRBs are massive stars still immersed in dense stellar clusters, these hadrons can efficiently interact with the matter after escaping from the jet. We calculate the spectra of neutrinos from the interaction of those hadrons with the matter of a huge cloud surrounding GRB. Those neutrinos form an afterglow on a time scale determined by their diffusion time scale in the cloud. Due to this long delay, their identification with any specific GRB is not possible. We estimate contribution of neutrinos from such afterglows to the extragalactic neutrino background recently reported by the IceCube Observatory.

title: Realistic observing scenarios for the next decade of early warning detection of binary neutron stars
authors: Ryan Magee, Ssohrab Borhanian
topic: We describe realistic observing scenarios for early warning detection of binary neutron star mergers with the current generation of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors as these approach design sensitivity. Using Fisher analysis, we estimate that Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo will detect one signal before merger in their fourth observing run provided they maintain a 70\% duty cycle. 60\% of all observations and 8\% of those detectable 20 seconds before merger will be localized to 100deg2. If KAGRA is able to achieve a 25 Mpc horizon, these prospects increase to 2 early detections with 70\% of all BNS localized to 100deg2 by merger. As the AHKLV network approaches design sensitivity over the next 10 years, we expect up to 1 (14) detections made 100 (10) seconds before merger. Although adding detectors to the HLV network impacts the detection rate at 50% level, it improves localization prospects and increases the completeness of compact binary surveys. Given uncertainties in sensitivities, participating detectors, and duty cycles, we consider 103 future detector configurations so electromagnetic observers can tailor preparations towards their preferred models.

title: Particle Acceleration in Mildly Relativistic Outflows of Fast Energetic Transient Sources
authors: Andrei Bykov, Vadim Romansky, Sergei Osipov
topic: Recent discovery of fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) as a new class of energetic transient sources can shed light on the long-standing problem of supernova-long gamma-ray burst connections. A distinctive feature of such objects is the presence of modestly relativistic outflows which place them in between the non-relativistic and relativistic supernovae-related events. Here we present the results of kinetic particle-in-cell and Monte Carlo simulations of particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification by shocks with the velocities in the interval between 0.1 and 0.7 c. These simulations are needed for the interpretation of the observed broad band radiation of FBOTs. Their fast, mildly to moderately relativistic outflows may efficiently accelerate relativistic particles. With particle-in-cell simulations we demonstrate that synchrotron radiation of accelerated relativistic electrons in the shock downstream may fit the observed radio fluxes. At longer timescales, well beyond those reachable within a particle-in-cell approach, our nonlinear Monte Carlo model predicts that protons and nuclei can be accelerated to petaelectronvolt (PeV) energies. Therefore, such fast and energetic transient sources can contribute to galactic populations of high energy cosmic rays.

title: Wakefield Acceleration in a Jet from a Neutrino Driven Accretion Flow around a Black Hole
authors: Yoshiaki Kato, Toshikazu Ebisuzaki, Toshiki Tajima
topic: We have investigated electro-magnetic (EM) wave pulses in a jet from a neutrino driven accretion flow (NDAF) around a black hole (BH). NDAFs are massive accretion disks whose accretion rates of M 0.0110Msun/s for stellar-mass BHs. Such an extreme accretion may produce a collimated relativistic outflow like a magnetically driven jet in active galactic nuclei and micro-quasars. When we consider strong toroidal magnetic field stranded in the inner-region of a NDAF disk and magnetic impulses on the jet, we find that they lead to the emanation of high energy emissions for gamma-ray bursts as well as high energy cosmic rays. When Alfvénic wave pulses are generated by episodic immense accretions, it propagates along the large-scale structured magnetic field in the jet. Once the Alfvénic wave pulses reach at nearly the speed of light in the underdense condition, it turns into EM wave pulses which produce plasma wakes behind them. These wakefields exert a collective accelerating force synchronous to the motion of particles. As a result, the wakefield acceleration premises various observational signatures, such as pulsating bursts of high energy gamma-rays from accelerated electrons, pulses of neutrinos from accelerated protons, and protons with maximum energies beyond 1020 eV.

title: Jet Formation in 3D GRMHD Simulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton Accretion
authors: Nicholas Kaaz, Ariadna Murguia-Berthier, Koushik Chatterjee, Matthew Liska, Alexander Tchekhovskoy
topic: A black hole (BH) travelling through a uniform, gaseous medium is described by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. If the medium is magnetized, then the black hole can produce relativistic outflows. We performed the first 3D, general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of BHL accretion onto rapidly rotating black holes using the code H-AMR, where we mainly varied the strength of a background magnetic field that threads the medium. We found that the ensuing accretion continuously drags to the BH the magnetic flux, which accumulates near the event horizon until it becomes dynamically important. Depending on the strength of the background magnetic field, the BHs can sometimes launch relativistic jets with high enough power to drill out of the inner accretion flow, become bent by the headwind, and escape to large distances. While for stronger background magnetic fields the jets are continuously powered, at weaker field strengths they are intermittent, turning on and off depending on the fluctuating gas and magnetic flux distributions near the event horizon. We find that our jets reach extremely high efficiencies of 100-300%, even in the absence of an accretion disk. We also calculated the drag forces exerted by the gas onto to the BH, finding that the presence of magnetic fields causes drag forces to be much less efficient than in unmagnetized BHL accretion, and sometimes become negative, accelerating the BH rather than slowing it down. Our results extend classical BHL accretion to rotating BHs moving through magnetized media and demonstrate that accretion and drag are significantly altered in this environment.

title: Theory of Electron Injection at Oblique Shock of Finite Thickness
authors: Takanobu Amano, Masahiro Hoshino
topic: A theory of electron injection into diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) for the generation of cosmic-ray electrons at collisionless shocks is presented. We consider a recently proposed particle acceleration mechanism called stochastic shock drift acceleration (SSDA). We find that SSDA may be understood as a diffusive particle acceleration mechanism at an oblique shock of finite thickness. More specifically, it is described by a solution to the diffusion-convection equation for particles with the characteristic diffusion length comparable to the shock thickness. On the other hand, the same equation yields the standard DSA if the diffusion length is much longer than the thickness. Although SSDA predicts, in general, a spectral index steeper than DSA, it is much more efficient for low-energy electron acceleration and is favorable for injection. The injection threshold energy corresponds to the transition energy between the two different regimes. It is of the order of 0.1-1 MeV in typical interstellar and interplanetary conditions if the dissipation scale of turbulence around the shock is determined by the ion inertial length. The electron injection is more efficient at high MA/cosBn where MA and Bn are the Alfvén Mach number and the shock obliquity. The theory suggests that efficient acceleration of electrons to ultra-relativistic energies will be more easily realized at high-Mach-number young supernova remnant shocks, but not at weak or moderate shocks in the heliosphere unless the upstream magnetic field is nearly perpendicular to the shock normal.

title: Plug Disintegration in GRB Jet Eruption
authors: Almog Yalinewich, Paz Beniamini
topic: In this work we consider the eruption of a tenuous relativistic hydrodynamic jet from a dense baryonic envelope. As the jet moves out and away, it carries along and continues to accelerate a layer of baryonic material which we refer to as the plug. We solve the relativistic equations of motion for the trajectory of the plug, and verify it using a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation. We show that under these conditions, the plug breaks up at a radius larger by a factor of a few from the radius of the envelope, due to the onset of the Rayleigh Taylor instability. After breakup the jet continues to accelerate to higher Lorentz factors while the plug fragments maintain a moderate Lorentz factor. The presence of slower moving ejecta can explain late time features of GRBs such as X ray flares without recourse to a long lived engine.

title: Compact objects formation, retention, and growth through accretion onto gas-embedded white-dwarfs/neutron-stars in gas-enriched globular-clusters
authors: Hagai B. Perets
topic: Observations of pulsars in globular clusters (GCs) give evidence that more 10-20% of neutron stars (NSs) ever formed in GCs were retained there. However, the velocity distribution of field pulsars peaks at 5-10 times the escape velocities of GCs. Consequently, only a small fraction of GC-NSs should have been retained, even accounting for low-velocity NSs formed through electron-capture supernovae. Thus, too few low-velocity NSs should have been retained in GCs, giving rise to the NS retention problem in GCs. Here we suggest a novel solution, in which the progenitors of most GC-NSs were ONe white-dwarfs (WDs) that accreted ambient intra-cluster gas and formed low-velocity NSs through accretion induced collapse (AIC). The existence of an early gas-enriched environment in GCs is supported by observations of GC multiple stellar populations. It is thought that 10s-100s of Myrs after the formation of the first generation of stars, and after ONe-WDs were already formed, GCs were replenished with gas which formed a second generation of stars. Accretion of such replenished gas onto the ONe-WDs catalyzed the AIC processes. The number of AIC-formed NSs is then sufficient to explain the large number of NSs retained in GCs. Similar processes might also drive CO-WDs to produce type-Ia SNe or to merge and form NSs, and similarly drive NSs to AIC and mergers producing BHs. Moreover, the wide variety of gas-catalyzed binary mergers and explosive transients suggest to occur in the gas-rich environments of AGN disk could similarly, and even more efficiently, occur in second-generation gas in GCs.

topic: We study the interaction of upstream ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves with collisionless shocks by analyzing the outputs of eleven 2D local hybrid simulation runs. Our simulated shocks have Alfvénic Mach numbers between 4.29-7.42 and their BN angles are 15, 30, 45 and 50. The ULF wave foreshocks develop upstream of all of them. The wavelength and the amplitude of the upstream waves exhibit a complex dependence on the shock's MA and BN. The wavelength positively correlates with both parameters, with the dependence on BN being much stronger. The amplitude of the ULF waves is proportional to the product of the reflected beam velocity and density, which also depend on MA and BN. The interaction of the ULF waves with the shock causes large-scale (several tens of upstream ion inertial lengths) shock rippling. The properties of the shock ripples are related to the ULF wave properties, namely thier wavelength and amplitude. In turn, the ripples have a large impact on the ULF wave transmission across the shock because they change local shock properties (BN, strength), so that different sections of the same ULF wave front encounter shock with different characteristics. Downstream fluctuations do not resemble the upstream waves in terms the wavefront extension, orientation or their wavelength. However some features are conserved in the Fourier spectra of downstream compressive waves that present a bump or flattening at wavelengths approximately corresponding to those of the upstream ULF waves. In the transverse downstream spectra these features are weaker.

title: Project Hephaistos I. Upper limits on partial Dyson spheres in the Milky Way
authors: Matías Suazo, Erik Zackrisson, Jason T. Wright, Andreas Korn, Macy Huston
topic: Dyson spheres are hypothetical megastructures built by advanced extraterrestrial civilizations to harvest radiation energy from stars. Here, we combine optical data from Gaia DR2 with mid-infrared data from AllWISE to set the strongest upper limits to date on the prevalence of partial Dyson spheres within the Milky Way, based on their expected waste-heat signatures. Conservative upper limits are presented on the fraction of stars at G  21 that may potentially host non-reflective Dyson spheres that absorb 1 - 90\% of the bolometric luminosity of their host stars and emit thermal waste-heat in the 100 - 1000 K range. Based on a sample of 2.7e5 stars within 100 pc, we find that a fraction less than 2e-5 could potentially host 300 K Dyson spheres at 90\% completion. These limits become progressively weaker for less complete Dyson spheres due to increased confusion with naturally occurring sources of strong mid-infrared radiation, and also at larger distances, due to the detection limits of WISE. For the 2.9e8 stars within 5 kpc in our Milky Way sample, the corresponding upper limit on the fraction of stars that could potentially be 300 K Dyson spheres at 90\% completion is  8e-4.

title: Calliope: Pseudospectral shearing magnetohydrodynamics code with a pencil decomposition
authors: Y. Kawazura
topic: The pseudospectral method is a highly accurate numerical scheme suitable for turbulence simulations. We have developed an open-source pseudospectral code, \textsc{\textsf{Calliope}}, which adopts the P3DFFT library \citep{Pekurovsky2012} to perform a fast Fourier transform with the two-dimensional (pencil) decomposition of numerical grids. \textsc{\textsf{Calliope}} can solve incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), isothermal compressible MHD, and rotational reduced MHD with parallel computation using very large numbers of cores (>105 cores for 20483 grids). The code can also solve for local magnetorotational turbulence in a shearing frame using the remapping method \citep{Rogallo1981,Umurhan2004}. \textsc{\textsf{Calliope}} is currently the only pseudospectral code that can compute magnetorotational turbulence using pencil-domain decomposition. This paper presents the numerical scheme of \textsc{\textsf{Calliope}} and the results of linear and nonlinear numerical tests, including compressible local magnetorotational turbulence with the largest grid number reported to date.

topic: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous astrophysical process that rapidly converts magnetic energy into some combination of plasma flow energy, thermal energy, and non-thermal energetic particles, including energetic electrons. Various reconnection acceleration mechanisms in different low-beta (plasma-to-magnetic pressure ratio) and collisionless environments have been proposed theoretically and studied numerically, including first- and second-order Fermi acceleration, betatron acceleration, parallel electric field acceleration along magnetic fields, and direct acceleration by the reconnection electric field. However, none of them have been heretofore confirmed experimentally, as the direct observation of non-thermal particle acceleration in laboratory experiments has been difficult due to short Debye lengths for \textit{in-situ} measurements and short mean free paths for \textit{ex-situ} measurements. Here we report the direct measurement of accelerated non-thermal electrons from low-beta magnetically driven reconnection in experiments using a laser-powered capacitor coil platform. We use kiloJoule lasers to drive parallel currents to reconnect MegaGauss-level magnetic fields in a quasi-axisymmetric geometry. The angular dependence of the measured electron energy spectrum and the resulting accelerated energies, supported by particle-in-cell simulations, indicate that the mechanism of direct electric field acceleration by the out-of-plane reconnection electric field is at work. Scaled energies using this mechanism show direct relevance to astrophysical observations. Our results therefore validate one of the proposed acceleration mechanisms by reconnection, and establish a new approach to study reconnection particle acceleration with laboratory experiments in relevant regimes.

title: Pair-instability mass loss for top-down compact object mass calculations
authors: M. Renzo, D. D. Hendriks, L. A. C. van Son, R. Farmer
topic: Population synthesis relies on semi-analytic formulae to determine masses of compact objects from the (helium or carbon-oxygen) cores of collapsing stars. Such formulae are combined across mass ranges that span different explosion mechanisms, potentially introducing artificial features in the compact object mass distribution. Such artifacts impair the interpretation of gravitational-wave observations. We propose a "top-down" remnant mass prescription where we remove mass from the star for each possible mass-loss mechanism, instead of relying on the fallback onto a "proto-compact-object" to get the final mass. For one of these mass-loss mechanisms, we fit the metallicity-dependent mass lost to pulsational-pair instability supernovae from numerical simulations. By imposing no mass loss in the absence of pulses, our approach recovers the existing compact object masses prescription at the low mass end and ensures continuity across the core-collapse/pulsational-pair-instability regime. Our remnant mass prescription can be extended to include other mass-loss mechanisms at the final collapse.

title: Inhomogeneous Jets from Neutron Star Mergers: One Jet to Rule them all
authors: Gavin P Lamb, Lorenzo Nativi, Stephan Rosswog, D. Alexander Kann, Andrew Levan, Christoffer Lundman, Nial Tanvir
topic: The broad, 4 order of magnitude range in energy, inferred via afterglow observations, for the short Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) population is difficult to reconcile with the narrow energy distribution expected from neutron star merger progenitors. Using the resultant profiles from 3D hydrodynamic simulations of relativistic jets interacting with neutron star merger wind ejecta, we show how the inhomogeneity of energy and velocity can alter the observed afterglow lightcurve. From a single jet we find that the peak afterglow flux depends sensitively on the observer's line-of-sight: at an inclination within the GRB emitting region we find peak flux variability on the order 0.5 dex through rotational orientation, and 1.3 dex for polar inclination. The inferred jet kinetic energy for a fixed parameter afterglow covers 1/3 of the observed short GRB population. We find a physically motivated, analytic jet structure function via our simulations and include an approximation for the varying collimation due to the merger ejecta mass. We show that by considering the observed range of merger ejecta masses, a short GRB jet population with a single intrinsic energy is capable of explaining the observed broad diversity in short GRB kinetic energies.

title: A Channel to Form Fast-spinning Black Hole--Neutron Star Binary Mergers as Multi-messenger Sources
authors: Rui-Chong Hu, Jin-Ping Zhu, Ying Qin, Bing Zhang, En-Wei Liang, Yong Shao
topic: After the successful detection of a gravitational-wave (GW) signal and its associated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts from GW170817, neutron star--black hole (NSBH) mergers have been highly expected to be the next type of multi-messenger source. However, despite the detection of several of NSBH merger candidates during the GW third observation run, no confirmed EM counterparts from these sources have been identified. The most plausible explanation is that these NSBH merger candidates were plunging events mainly because the primary BHs had near-zero projected aligned-spins based on GW observations. In view that NSs can be easily tidally disrupted by BHs with high projected aligned-spins, we study an evolution channel to form NSBH binaries with fast-spinning BHs, the properties of BH mass and spin, and their associated tidal disruption probability. We find that if the NSs are born firstly, the companion helium stars would be tidally spun up efficiently, and would thus finally form fast-spinning BHs. If BHs do not receive significant natal kicks at birth, these NSBH binaries that can merge within the Hubble time would have BHs with the projected aligned-spins chiz=0.8 and, hence, can certainly allow tidal disruption to happen. Even if significant BH kicks are considered for a small fraction of NSBH binaries, the projected aligned-spins of BHs are chi-z=0.2. These systems can still be disrupted events unless the NSs are very massive. Thus, NS-first-born NSBH mergers would be promising multi-messenger sources. We discuss various potential EM counterparts associated with these systems and their detectability in the upcoming fourth observation run.

topic: Misalignment between rotation and magnetic field has been suggested to be one type of physical mechanisms which can easen the effects of magnetic braking during collapse of cloud cores leading to formation of protostellar disks. However, its essential factors are poorly understood. Therefore, we perform a more detailed analysis of the physics involved. We analyze existing simulation data to measure the system torques, mass accretion rates and Toomre Q parameters. We also examine the presence of shocks in the system. While advective torques are generally the strongest, we find that magnetic and gravitational torques can play substantial roles in how angular momentum is transferred during the disk formation process. Magnetic torques can shape the accretion flows, creating two-armed magnetized inflow spirals aligned with the magnetic field. We find evidence of an accretion shock that is aligned according to the spiral structure of the system. Inclusion of ambipolar diffusion as explored in this work has shown a slight influence in the small scale structures but not in the main morphology. We discuss potential candidate systems where some of these phenomena could be present.

title: The forward and reverse shock dynamics of Cassiopeia A
authors: Jacco Vink (1), Daniel J. Patnaud (2), Daniel Castro (2) 
topic: We report on proper motion measurements of the forward- and reverse-shock regions of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A), including deceleration/acceleration measurements of the forward shock. The measurements combine 19 years of observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, using the 4.2-6 keV continuum band, preferentially targeting X-ray synchrotron radiation. The average expansion rate is 0.218pm0.029%yr-1 for the forward shock, corresponding to a velocity of 5800 km/s. The time derivative of the proper motions indicates deceleration in the east, and an acceleration up to 1.1x10-4 yr-2 in the western part. The reverse shock moves outward in the East, but in the West it moves toward the center with an expansion rate of -0.0225pm0.0007 %yr-1, corresponding to -1884pm17 km/s. In the West the reverse shock velocity in the ejecta frame is leq3000 km/s, peaking at 8000 km/s, explaining the presence of X-ray synchrotron emitting filaments there. The backward motion of the reverse shock can be explained by either a scenario in which the forward shock encountered a partial, dense, wind shell, or one in which the shock transgressed initially through a lopsided cavity, created during a brief Wolf-Rayet star phase. Both scenarios are consistent with the local acceleration of the forward shock. Finally we report on the proper motion of the northeastern jet, using both the X-ray continuum band, and the Si XIII K-line emission band. We find expansion rates of respectively 0.21%yr−1 and 0.24%yr−1, corresponding to velocities at the tip of the X-ray jet of 7830--9200 km/s.

title: Linking the rates of neutron star binaries and short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Nikhil Sarin, Paul D. Lasky, Francisco H. Vivanco, Simon P. Stevenson, Debatri Chattopadhyay, Rory Smith, Eric Thrane
topic: Short gamma-ray bursts are believed to be produced by both binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. We use current estimates for the BNS and NSBH merger rates to calculate the fraction of observable short gamma-ray bursts produced through each channel. This allows us to constrain merger rates of BNS to (90% credible interval), a 16% decrease in the rate uncertainties from the second LIGO--Virgo Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, GWTC-2. Assuming a top-hat emission profile with a large Lorentz factor, we constrain the average opening angle of gamma-ray burst jets produced in BNS mergers to 15. We also measure the fraction of BNS and NSBH mergers that produce an observable short gamma-ray burst to be 0.02+0.02-0.01 and 0.01pm0.01, respectively and find that 40% of BNS mergers launch jets (90\% confidence). We forecast constraints for future gravitational-wave detections given different modelling assumptions, including the possibility that BNS and NSBH jets are different. With 24 BNS and 55 NSBH observations, expected within six months of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network operating at design sensitivity, it will be possible to constrain the fraction of BNS and NSBH mergers that launch jets with 10% precision. Within a year of observations, we can determine whether the jets launched in NSBH mergers have a different structure than those launched in BNS mergers and rule out whether ≳80% of binary neutron star mergers launch jets. We discuss the implications of future constraints on understanding the physics of short gamma-ray bursts and binary evolution.

title: Observational signatures of stellar explosions driven by relativistic jets
authors: Moshe Eisenberg, Ore Gottlieb, Ehud Nakar
topic: The role of relativistic jets in unbinding the stellar envelope during a supernova (SN) associated with a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is unclear. To study that, we explore observational signatures of stellar explosions that are driven by jets. We focus on the final velocity distribution of the outflow in such explosions and compare its observational imprints to SN/GRB data. We find that jet driven explosions produce an outflow with a flat distribution of energy per logarithmic scale of proper velocity. The flat distribution seems to be universal as it is independent of the jet and the progenitor properties that we explored. The velocity range of the flat distribution for typical GRB parameters is Gammabeta=0.03-3, where Gamma is the outflow Lorentz factor and Beta is its dimensionless velocity. A flat distribution is seen also for collimated choked jets where the highest outflow velocity decreases with the depth at which the jet is choked. Comparison to observations of SN/GRBs rules out jets as the sole explosion source in these events. Instead, in SN/GRB the collapsing star must deposit its energy into two channels - a quasi-spherical (or wide angle) channel and a narrowly collimated one. The former carries most of the energy and is responsible for the SN sub-relativistic ejecta while the latter carries 0.01-0.1 of the total outflow energy and is the source of the GRB. Intriguingly, the same two channels, with a similar energy ratio, were seen in the binary neutron star merger GW170817, suggesting that similar engines are at work in both phenomena.

title: On the Existence of Fast Modes in Compressible Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence
authors: Zhaoming Gan, Hui Li, Xiangrong Fu, Senbei Du
topic: We study the existence and property of Fast magnetosonic modes in 3D compressible MHD turbulence by carrying out a number of simulations with compressible and incompressible driving conditions. We use two approaches to determine the presence of Fast modes: mode decomposition based on spatial variations only and spatio-temporal 4D-FFT analysis of all fluctuations. The latter method enables us to quantify fluctuations that satisfy the dispersion relation of Fast modes with finite frequency. Overall, we find that the fraction of Fast modes identified via spatio-temporal 4D FFT approach in total fluctuation power is either tiny with nearly incompressible driving or 2% with highly compressible driving. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding the compressible fluctuations in space and astrophysics plasmas.

title: Magnetic Field Evolution in Neutron Star Crusts: Beyond the Hall Effect
authors: Konstantinos N. Gourgouliatos, Davide De Grandis, Andrei Igoshev
topic: Neutron stars host the strongest magnetic fields that we know of in the Universe. Their magnetic fields are the main means of generating their radiation, either magnetospheric or through the crust. Moreover, the evolution of the magnetic field has been intimately related to explosive events of magnetars, which host strong magnetic fields, and their persistent thermal emission. The evolution of the magnetic field in the crusts of neutron stars has been described within the framework of the Hall effect and Ohmic dissipation. Yet, this description is limited by the fact that the Maxwell stresses exerted on the crusts of strongly magnetised neutron stars may lead to failure and temperature variations. In the former case, a failed crust does not completely fulfil the necessary conditions for the Hall effect. In the latter, the variations of temperature are strongly related to the magnetic field evolution. Finally, sharp gradients of the star's temperature may activate battery terms and alter the magnetic field structure, especially in weakly magnetised neutron stars. In this review, we discuss the recent progress made on these effects. We argue that these phenomena are likely to provide novel insight into our understanding of neutron stars and their observable properties.

title: Using machine learning to parametrize postmerger signals from binary neutron stars
authors: Tim Whittaker, William E. East, Stephen R. Green, Luis Lehner, Huan Yang
topic: There is growing interest in the detection and characterization of gravitational waves from postmerger oscillations of binary neutron stars. These signals contain information about the nature of the remnant and the high-density and out-of-equilibrium physics of the postmerger processes, which would complement any electromagnetic signal. However, the construction of binary neutron star postmerger waveforms is much more complicated than for binary black holes: (i) there are theoretical uncertainties in the neutron-star equation of state and other aspects of the high-density physics, (ii) numerical simulations are expensive and available ones only cover a small fraction of the parameter space with limited numerical accuracy, and (iii) it is unclear how to parametrize the theoretical uncertainties and interpolate across parameter space. In this work, we describe the use of a machine-learning method called a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to construct postmerger models for hyper/massive neutron star remnant signals based on numerical-relativity simulations. The CVAE provides a probabilistic model, which encodes uncertainties in the training data within a set of latent parameters. We estimate that training such a model will ultimately require 104 waveforms. However, using synthetic training waveforms as a proof-of-principle, we show that the CVAE can be used as an accurate generative model and that it encodes the equation of state in a useful latent representation.

title: Tearing instability and current-sheet disruption in the turbulent dynamo
authors: Alisa K. Galishnikova, Matthew W. Kunz, Alexander A. Schekochihin
topic: Turbulence in a conducting plasma can amplify seed magnetic fields in what is known as the turbulent, or small-scale, dynamo. The associated growth rate and emergent magnetic-field geometry depend sensitively on the material properties of the plasma, in particular on the Reynolds number Re, the magnetic Reynolds number Rm, and their ratio Pm=Rm/Re. For Pm>1, the amplified magnetic field is gradually arranged into a folded structure, with direction reversals at the resistive scale and field lines curved at the larger scale of the flow. As the mean magnetic energy grows to come into approximate equipartition with the fluid motions, this folded structure is thought to persist. Using analytical theory and high-resolution MHD simulations with the Athena++ code, we show that these magnetic folds become unstable to tearing during the nonlinear stage of the dynamo for Rm-104 and Re-103. An Rm- and Pm-dependent tearing scale, at and below which folds are disrupted, is predicted theoretically and found to match well the characteristic field-reversal scale measured in the simulations. The disruption of folds by tearing increases the ratio of viscous-to-resistive dissipation. In the saturated state, the magnetic-energy spectrum exhibits a sub-tearing-scale steepening to a slope consistent with that predicted for tearing-mediated Alfvénic turbulence. Its spectral peak appears to be independent of the resistive scale and comparable to the driving scale of the flow, while the magnetic energy resides in a broad range of scales extending down to the field-reversal scale set by tearing. Emergence of a degree of large-scale magnetic coherence in the saturated state of the turbulent dynamo may be consistent with observations of magnetic-field fluctuations in galaxy clusters and recent laboratory experiments.

title: X-ray Line Diagnostics of Ion Temperature at Cosmic-Ray Accelerating Collisionless Shocks
authors: Jiro Shimoda, Yutaka Ohira, Aya Bamba, Yukikatsu Terada, Ryo Yamazaki, Tsuyoshi Inoue, Shuta J. Tanaka
topic: A novel collisionless shock jump condition is suggested by modeling the entropy production at the shock transition region. We also calculate downstream developments of the atomic ionization balance and the ion temperature relaxation in supernova remnants (SNRs). The injection process and subsequent acceleration of cosmic-rays (CRs) in the SNR shocks are closely related to the formation process of the collisionless shocks. The formation of the shock is caused by wave-particle interactions. Since the wave-particle interactions result in energy exchanges between electromagnetic fields and charged particles, the randomization of particles associated with the shock transition may occur with the rate given by the scalar product of the electric field and current. We find that order-of-magnitude estimates of the randomization with reasonable strength of the electromagnetic fields in the SNR constrain the amount of the CR nuclei and ion temperatures. The constrained amount of the CR nuclei can be sufficient to explain the Galactic CRs. The ion temperature becomes significantly lower than the case of no CRs. To distinguish the case without CRs, we perform synthetic observations of atomic line emissions from the downstream region of the SNR RCW86. Future observations by {\it XRISM} and {\it Athena} can distinguish whether the SNR shock accelerates the CRs or not from the ion temperatures.

title: High magnetic field neutron stars and magnetars in binary systems
authors: S.B. Popov 
topic: Situation with highly magnetized neutron stars in binary systems is not yet certain. On the one hand, all best studied magnetars seem to be isolated objects. On the other, there are many claims based on model-dependent analysis of spin properties or/and luminosity of neutron stars in X-ray binaries in favour of large fields. In addition, there are a few results suggesting a magnetar-like activity of neutron stars in close binary systems. Most of theoretical considerations do not favour even existence, not speaking about active decay, of magnetar-scale fields in neutron stars older than 106yrs. However, alternative scenarios of the field evolution exist. I provide a brief review of theoretical and observational results related to the presence of neutron stars with large magnetic field in binaries and discuss perspectives of future studies.

title: Spectral and polarization properties of reflected X-ray emission from black hole accretion discs
authors: Jakub Podgorný, Michal Dovčiak, Frédéric Marin, René Goosmann, Agata Różańska
topic: X-ray polarimetric missions planned for this decade will significantly enhance our knowledge of compact accreting sources. Observations of the X-ray polarization signal from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or X-ray binary systems (XRBs) will bring new means to study inner accretion flow in these objects that, together with currently used spectroscopic and timing techniques, will help us to determine better their properties, such as their inclination, orientation, shape, and size of their corona as well as the black hole spin. In this work, we present a yet missing piece in the global polarization models of black hole accretion discs. We compute the reflected X-ray emission from the disc in a local co-moving frame using (1) the radiative transfer code TITAN to obtain the ionization structure of the disc and (2) the Monte Carlo code STOKES that incorporates the physics of absorption, re-emission, and Compton scattering to produce a complete spectropolarimetric output. We present the final Stokes parameters I, Q, and U for a set of photon-indices of the incident primary power-law radiation, the disc ionization parameters, incident and emission angles, for three independent polarization states of the incident coronal X-ray photons with a sufficient resolution in energy to allow for sharp discussion of spectral and polarization properties. We show that the spectral component matches well literature predictions. The polarization degree and angle are in agreement with analytical approximations previously appearing in reflection models and we demonstrate that the polarized reflected X-ray emission can be, locally, quite large in the 2-12 keV band.

title: A stable and causal model of magnetohydrodynamics
authors: Jay Armas, Filippo Camilloni
topic: We formulate the theory of first-order dissipative magnetohydrodynamics in an arbitrary hydrodynamic frame under the assumption of parity-invariance and discrete charge symmetry. We study the mode spectrum of Alfvén and magnetosonic waves as well as the spectrum of gapped excitations and derive constraints on the transport coefficients such that generic equilibrium states with constant magnetic fields are stable and causal under linearised perturbations. We solve these constraints for a specific equation of state and show that there exists a large family of hydrodynamic frames that renders the linear fluctuations stable and causal. This theory does not require introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom and therefore is a promising and simpler alternative to Müller-Israel-Stewart-type theories. Together with a detailed analysis of transport, entropy production and Kubo formulae, the theory presented here is well suited for studying dissipative effects in various contexts ranging from heavy-ion collisions to astrophysics.

title: Distinguishing gravitational and emission physics in black-hole imaging: spherical symmetry
authors: Prashant Kocherlakota, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: Imaging a supermassive black hole and extracting physical information requires good knowledge of both the gravitational and the astrophysical conditions near the black hole. When the geometrical properties of the black hole are well understood, extracting information on the emission properties is possible. Similarly, when the emission properties are well understood, extracting information on the black-hole geometry is possible. At present however, uncertainties are present both in the geometry and in the emission, and this inevitably leads to degeneracies in the interpretation of the observations. We explore here the impact of varying geometry and emission coefficient when modelling the imaging of a spherically-accreting black hole. Adopting the Rezzolla-Zhidenko parametric metric to model arbitrary static black-holes, we first demonstrate how shadow-size measurements leave degeneracies in the multidimensional space of metric-deviation parameters, even in the limit of infinite-precision measurements. Then, at finite precision, we show that these degenerate regions can be constrained when multiple pieces of information, such as the shadow-size and the peak image intensity contrast, are combined. Such degeneracies can potentially be eliminated with measurements at increased angular-resolution and flux-sensitivity. While our approach is restricted to spherical symmetry and hence idealised, we expect our results to hold also when more complex geometries and emission processes are considered.

title: Implicit correlations within phenomenological parametric models of the neutron star equation of state
authors: Isaac Legred, Katerina Chatziioannou, Reed Essick, Philippe Landry
topic: The rapid increase in the number and precision of astrophysical probes of neutron stars in recent years allows for the inference of their equation of state. Observations target different macroscopic properties of neutron stars which vary from star to star, such as mass and radius, but the equation of state allows for a common description of all neutron stars. To connect these observations and infer the properties of dense matter and neutron stars simultaneously, models for the equation of state are introduced. Parametric models rely on carefully engineered functional forms that reproduce a large array of realistic equations of state. Such models benefit from their simplicity but are limited because any finite-parameter model cannot accurately approximate all possible equations of state. Nonparametric models overcome this by increasing model freedom at the cost of increased complexity. In this study, we compare common parametric and nonparametric models, quantify the limitations of the former, and study the impact of modeling on our current understanding of high-density physics. We show that parametric models impose strongly model-dependent, and sometimes opaque, correlations between density scales. Such inter-density correlations result in tighter constraints that are unsupported by data and can lead to biased inference of the equation of state and of individual neutron star properties.

topic: Two neutron star (NS) black hole (BH) binaries, GW200105 and GW200115 found in the LIGO/Virgo O3b run have smaller BH mass of 6-9Msun which is consistent with Population I and II origin. Our population synthesis simulations using 106 Population I and II binaries with appropriate initial parameters show consistent binary mass, event rate, and no detection of radio pulsar (PSR) and BH binaries in our Galaxy so far. Especially, we found possible progenitors of GW200105 and GW200115 which were formed at redshift z=0.15 and z=1.6 with binary mass of (34Msun,9.2Msun) and (23.7Msun,10.6Msun), respectively. The final masses of these binaries are (6.85Msun,2.14Msun) and (6.04Msun,1.31Msun) which look like (9.0+1.7-1.7Msun,1.91+0.33-0.24Msun) of GW200105 and (5.9+2.0-2.5Msun,1.44+0.85-0.29Msun) of GW200115, respectively. We also estimate that 4-20 PSR-BH binaries in our galaxy will be observed by SKA. The existence of NS-BH binaries in our galaxy can be confirmed in future SKA era.

title: Intensity and Polarization Characteristics of Extended Neutron Star Surface Regions
authors: Kun Hu, Matthew G. Baring, Joseph A. Barchas, George Younes
topic: The surfaces of neutron stars are sources of strongly polarized soft X rays due to the presence of strong magnetic fields. Radiative transfer mediated by electron scattering and free-free absorption is central to defining local surface anisotropy and polarization signatures. Scattering transport is strongly influenced by the complicated interplay between linear and circular polarizations. This complexity has been captured in a sophisticated magnetic Thomson scattering simulation we recently developed to model the outer layers of fully-ionized atmospheres in such compact objects, heretofore focusing on case studies of localized surface regions. Yet, the interpretation of observed intensity pulse profiles and their efficacy in constraining key neutron star geometry parameters is critically dependent upon adding up emission from extended surface regions. In this paper, intensity, anisotropy and polarization characteristics from such extended atmospheres, spanning considerable ranges of magnetic colatitudes, are determined using our transport simulation. These constitute a convolution of varied properties of Stokes parameter information at disparate surface locales with different magnetic field strengths and directions relative to the local zenith. Our analysis includes full general relativistic propagation of light from the surface to an observer at infinity. The array of pulse profiles for intensity and polarization presented highlights how powerful probes of stellar geometry are possible. Significant phase-resolved polarization degrees in the range of 10-60\% are realized when summing over a variety of surface field directions. These results provide an important background for observations to be acquired by NASA's new IXPE X-ray polarimetry mission.

topic: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that associated with supernova (SN) are believed to originate from massive star core-collapse events, whereas short-duration GRBs that are related to compact star mergers are expected to be accompanied by kilonova. GRB 211227A, lasting about 84 s, has a initial short/hard spike followed by a series of soft gamma-ray extended emission at redshift z=0.228. Moreover, lack of supernova associated, is down to very stringent limits at such low redshift, and is with a large physical offset (20.47 14.47 kpc) from the galaxy center. Those behaviors are similar to that of GRB 060614, and suggest that the progenitor of GRB 211227A is not favored with the death of massive stars. Hence, we propose that GRB 211227A has the same physical origin with that of GRB 060614 which is from compact star mergers. One calculate pseudo-kilonova emission of this case by adopting the typical parameters with that of GRB 060614 and GRB 170817A, and we find that this pseudo-kilonova is too faint to be detected. If this is the case, it can naturally interpret the characteristic of prompt emission, lack of SN and kilonova emission, and the large physical offset from the galaxy center.

title: Modelling astrophysical fluids with particles
authors: Stephan Rosswog
topic: Computational fluid dynamics is a crucial tool to theoretically explore the cosmos. In the last decade, we have seen a substantial methodological diversification with a number of cross-fertilizations between originally different methods. Here we focus on recent developments related to the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We briefly summarize recent technical improvements in the SPH-approach itself, including smoothing kernels, gradient calculations and dissipation steering. These elements have been implemented in the Newtonian high-accuracy SPH code MAGMA2 and we demonstrate its performance in a number of challenging benchmark tests. Taking it one step further, we have used these new ingredients also in the first particle-based, general-relativistic fluid dynamics code that solves the full set of Einstein equations, SPHINCS_BSSN. We present the basic ideas and equations and demonstrate the code performance at examples of relativistic neutron stars that are evolved self-consistently together with the spacetime.

title: Exotic Compact Objects: The Dark White Dwarf
authors: Michael Ryan, David Radice
topic: Several dark matter models allow for the intriguing possibility of exotic compact object formation. These objects might have unique characteristics that set them apart from their baryonic counterparts. Furthermore, gravitational wave observations of their mergers may provide the only direct window on a potentially entirely hidden sector. Here we discuss dark white dwarfs, starting with an overview of the microphysical model and analytic scaling relations of macroscopic properties derived from the non-relativistic limit. We use the full relativistic formalism to confirm these scaling relations and demonstrate that dark white dwarfs, if they exist, would have masses and tidal deformabilities that are very different from those of baryonic compact objects. Further, and most importantly, we demonstrate that dark white dwarf mergers would be detectable by current or planned gravitational observatories across several orders of magnitude in the particle-mass parameter space. Lastly, we find universal relations analogous to the compactness-Love and binary Love relations in neutron star literature. Using these results, we show that gravitational wave observations would constrain the properties of the dark matter particles constituting these objects.

title: The role of plasma instabilities in relativistic radiation mediated shocks: stability analysis and particle-in-cell simulations
authors: Arno Vanthieghem, Jens F. Mahlmann, Amir Levinson, Alexander A. Philippov, Ehud Nakar, Frederico Fiuza
topic: Relativistic radiation mediated shocks (RRMS) likely form in prodigious cosmic explosions. The structure and emission of such shocks is regulated by copious production of electron-positron pairs inside the shock transition layer. It has been pointed out recently that substantial abundance of positrons inside the shock leads to a velocity separation of the different plasma constituents, which is expected to induce a rapid growth of plasma instabilities. In this paper, we study the hierarchy of plasma microinstabilities growing in an electron-ion plasma loaded with pairs and subject to a radiation force. Linear stability analysis indicates that such a system is unstable to the growth of various plasma modes which ultimately become dominated by a current filamentation instability driven by the relative drift between the ions and the pairs. These results are validated by particle-in-cell simulations that further probe the nonlinear regime of the instabilities, and the pair-ion coupling in the microturbulent electromagnetic field. Based on this analysis, we derive a reduced transport equation for the particles via pitch angle scattering in the microturbulence and demonstrate that it can couple the different species and lead to nonadiabatic compression via a Joule-like heating. The heating of the pairs and, conceivably, the formation of nonthermal distributions, arising from the microturbulence, can affect the observed shock breakout signal in ways unaccounted for by current single-fluid models.

title: Radio bridges of the future between Solar system and the nearest 50 stars
authors: Claudio Maccone, Nicolò Antonietti
topic: The Solar Gravitational Lens (SGL) is a gift of nature that Humanity is now ready to exploit. SGL physics started with Einstein's 1936 paper on the gravitational lensing; it was not until 1979 that the idea of a space mission reaching the Sun's nearest focal sphere at 550 Astronomical Units (AU) was put forward by Von Eshleman. By the year 2000, the senior author of this paper (CM) had submitted a relevant formal proposal to ESA about the relevant space mission to 550 AU. He presented his ideas at NASA-JPL for the first time on August 18. In 2020 NASA awarded a 2million grant to JPL to prepare for the first FOCAL space mission. But radio bridges between the Sun and any nearby star may also be conceived. The idea is that, if Humanity will be able to send unmanned space probes to the nearest stars in the future, each of these probes could be placed behind the star of arrival and along the star-Sun line, thus allowing for TWO gravitational lenses to work together. That will result in a permanent communication system with much REDUCED POWERS to keep the radio link between the two stellar systems: a veritable Galactic Internet. In this paper, we study for the first time the 50 radio bridges between the Sun and each of the nearest 100 stars in the Galaxy. Of course, this work is for the centuries to come. But knowing which natural radio bridge between the Sun and each of the nearest 50 stars is MORE CONVENIENT, will open the ROAD MAP for the HUMAN EXPANSION into the Galaxy.

title: Is magnetically dominated outflow required to explain GRBs?
authors: Gregory Vereshchagin, Liang Li, Damien Bégué
topic: The composition of relativistic outflows producing gamma-ray bursts is a long standing open question. One of the main arguments in favor of magnetically dominated outflows is the absence of photospheric component in their broadband time resolved spectra, with such notable example as GRB 080916C. Here, we perform a time-resolved analysis of this burst and confirm the previous detection of an additional spectral component. We show that this subdominant component is consistent with the photosphere of ultrarelativistic baryonic outflow, deep in the coasting regime. We argue that, contrary to previous statements, the magnetic dominance of the outflow is not required for the interpretation of this GRB. Moreover, simultaneous detection of high energy emission in its prompt phase requires departure from a one-zone emission model.

title: Shocked jets in CCSNe can power the zoo of fast blue optical transients
authors: Ore Gottlieb, Alexander Tchekhovskoy, Raffaella Margutti
topic: Evidence is mounting that recent multi-wavelength detections of fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) in star-forming galaxies comprise a new class of transients, whose origin is yet to be understood. We show that hydrogen-rich collapsing stars that launch relativistic jets near the central engine can naturally explain the entire set of FBOT observables. The jet-star interaction forms a mildly-relativistic shocked jet (inner cocoon) component, which powers cooling emission that dominates the high velocity optical signal during the first few weeks, with a typical energy of 1050-1051 erg. During this time, the cocoon radial energy distribution implies that the optical lightcurve exhibits a fast decay of L-t-2.4. After a few weeks, when the velocity of the emitting shell is 0.01 c, the cocoon becomes transparent, and the cooling stellar envelope governs the emission. During this transition, discontinuities may emerge in the lightcurve and spectra, as have been observed in a few FBOTs, such as AT2018cow. The interaction between the cocoon forward shock and the dense circumstellar winds generates synchrotron self-absorbed emission in the radio bands, featuring a steady rise on a month timescale. After a few months, if the jet successfully pierces the stellar envelope, it decelerates, enters the observer's line of sight, and powers the peak of the radio lightcurve, which rapidly decays thereafter. The jet (and the inner cocoon) become optically thin to X-rays day after the collapse, allowing X-ray photons to diffuse from the central engine that launched the jet to the observer. Cocoon cooling emission is expected at higher volumetric rates than gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by a factor of a few, similar to FBOTs. We rule out uncollimated outflows, however both GRB jets and failed collimated jets are compatible with all observables.

title: Modelling of propagation of very-high-energy gamma rays with CRbeam code. Comparison with CRPropa and ELMAG codes
authors: O.Kalashev, A.Korochkin, A.Neronov, D.Semikoz
topic: Very-high-energy gamma rays produce electron positron pairs in interactions with low-energy photons of extragalactic background light during propagation through the intergalactic medium. The electron-positron pairs generate secondary gamma rays detectable by gamma-ray telescopes. This secondary emission can be used to detect Inter-Galactic Magnetic Fields (IGMF) in the voids of Large Scale Structure. New gamma-ray observatory, Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), will provide an increase of sensitivity for detection of these secondary gamma-ray emission and enable measurement of its properties for sources at cosmological distances. Interpretation of the CTA data including detection of IGMF and study of it's properties and origin will require precision modelling of the primary and secondary gamma-ray fluxes. We asses the precision of the modelling of the secondary gamma-ray emission using model calculations with publicly available Monte-Carlo codes CRPropa and ELMAG and compare their predictions with theoretical expectations and with model calculations of a newly developed CRbeam code. We find that model predictions of different codes differ by up to 50% for low-redshift sources, with discrepancies increasing up to order-of-magnitude level with the increasing source redshifts. We identify the origin of these discrepancies and argue that the new CRbeam code provides reliable predictions for spectral, timing and imaging properties of the secondary gamma-ray signal and can be used to study gamma-ray sources and IGMF with precision relevant for the prospective CTA study of the effects of gamma-ray propagation through the intergalactic medium.

title: Gamma-ray Burst Prompt Emission Spectrum and Ep Evolution Patterns in the ICMART Model
authors: Xueying Shao, He Gao
topic: In this paper, we simulate the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) prompt emission light curve, spectrum and Ep evolution patterns within the framework of the Internal-Collision-induced MAgnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. We show that this model can produce a Band shape spectrum, whose parameters (Ep, alpha, beta) could distribute in the typical distribution from GRB observations, as long as the magnetic field and the electron acceleration process in the emission region are under appropriate conditions. On the other hand, we show that for one ICMART event, Ep evolution is always a hard-to-soft pattern. However, a GRB light curve is usually composed of multiple ICMART events that are fundamentally driven by the erratic GRB central engine activity. In this case, we find that if one individual broad pulse in the GRB light curve is composed of multiple ICMART events, the overall Ep evolution could be disguised as the intense-tracking pattern. Therefore, mixed Ep evolution patterns can coexist in the same burst, with a variety of combined patterns. Our results support the ICMART model to be a competitive model to explain the main properties of GRB prompt emission. The possible challenges faced by the ICMART model are also discussed in details.

title: Nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability in eccentric disks
authors: Chi-Ho Chan, Tsvi Piran, Julian H. Krolik
topic: The magnetorotational instability (MRI) has been extensively studied in circular magnetized disks, and its ability to drive accretion has been demonstrated in a multitude of scenarios. There are reasons to expect eccentric magnetized disks to also exist, but the behavior of the MRI in these disks remains largely uncharted territory. Here we present the first simulations that follow the nonlinear development of the MRI in eccentric disks. We find that the MRI in eccentric disks resembles circular disks in two ways, in the overall level of saturation and in the dependence of the detailed saturated state on magnetic topology. However, in contrast with circular disks, the Maxwell stress in eccentric disks can be negative in some disk sectors, even though the integrated stress is always positive. The angular momentum flux raises the eccentricity of the inner parts of the disk and diminishes the same of the outer parts. Because material accreting onto a black hole from an eccentric orbit possesses more energy than material tracing the innermost stable circular orbit, the radiative efficiency of eccentric disks may be significantly lower than circular disks. This may resolve the "inverse energy problem" seen in many tidal disruption events.

title: Impact of extreme spins and mass ratios on the post-merger observables of high-mass binary neutron stars
authors: L. Jens Papenfort, Elias R. Most, Samuel Tootle, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: The gravitational-wave events GW170817 and GW190425 have led to a number of important insights on the equation of state of dense matter and the properties of neutron stars, such as their radii and the maximum mass. Some of these conclusions have been drawn on the basis of numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron-star mergers with vanishing initial spins. While this may be a reasonable assumption in equal-mass systems, it may be violated in the presence of large mass asymmetries accompanied by the presence of high spins. To quantify the impact of high spins on multi-messenger gravitational-wave events, we have carried out a series of high-mass binary neutron-star mergers with a highly spinning primary star and large mass asymmetries that have been modelled self-consistently using two temperature-dependent equations of state. We show that, when compared with equal-mass, irrotational binaries, these systems can lead to significant differences in the remnant lifetime, in the dynamical ejecta, in the remnant disc masses, in the secular ejecta, and on the bulk kilonova properties. These differences could be exploited to remove the degeneracy between low- and high-spin priors in the detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron-star mergers.

title: 4FGL J1120.0-2204: A Unique Gamma-ray Bright Neutron Star Binary with an Extremely Low Mass Proto-White Dwarf
authors: Samuel J. Swihart, Jay Strader, Elias Aydi, Laura Chomiuk, Kristen C. Dage, Adam Kawash, Kirill V. Sokolovsky, Elizabeth C. Ferrara
topic: We have discovered a new X-ray emitting compact binary that is the likely counterpart to the unassociated Fermi-LAT GeV gamma-ray source 4FGL J1120.0-2204, the second brightest Fermi source that still remains formally unidentified. Using optical spectroscopy with the SOAR telescope, we have identified a warm (Teff-8500 K) companion in a 15.1-hr orbit around an unseen primary, which is likely a yet-undiscovered millisecond pulsar. A precise Gaia parallax shows the binary is nearby, at a distance of only 820 pc. Unlike the typical "spider" or white dwarf secondaries in short-period millisecond pulsar binaries, our observations suggest the 0.17Msun companion is in an intermediate stage, contracting on the way to becoming an extremely low-mass helium white dwarf (a "pre-ELM" white dwarf). Although the companion is apparently unique among confirmed or candidate millisecond pulsar binaries, we use binary evolution models to show that in 2 Gyr, the properties of the binary will match those of several millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries with very short (1 d) orbital periods. This makes 4FGL J1120.0-2204 the first system discovered in the penultimate phase of the millisecond pulsar recycling process.

title: Systematic exploration of heavy element nucleosynthesis in protomagnetar outflows
authors: Nick Ekanger, Mukul Bhattacharya, Shunsaku Horiuchi
topic: We study the nucleosynthesis products in neutrino-driven winds from rapidly rotating, highly magnetised and misaligned protomagnetars using the nuclear reaction network SkyNet. We adopt a semi-analytic parameterized model for the protomagnetar and systematically study the capabilities of its neutrino-driven wind for synthesizing nuclei and eventually producing ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We find that for neutron-rich outflows (Ye less 0.5), synthesis of heavy elements () is possible during the first 10 seconds of the outflow, but these nuclei are subjected to composition-altering photodisintegration during the epoch of particle acceleration at the dissipation radii. However, after the first 10 seconds of the outflow, nucleosynthesis reaches lighter elements (A 10-50) that are not subjected to subsequent photodisintegration. For proton-rich (Ye gret 0.5) outflows, synthesis is more limited (A 4-15). These suggest that while protomagnetars typically do not synthesize nuclei heavier than second r-process peak elements, they are intriguing sources of intermediate/heavy mass UHECRs. For all configurations, the most rapidly rotating protomagnetars are more conducive for nucleosynthesis with a weaker dependence on the magnetic field strength.

title: Formation of Magnetically Truncated Accretion Disks in 3D Radiation-Transport Two-Temperature GRMHD Simulations
authors: M.liska, G. Musoke, A. Tchekhovskhoy, O. Porth
topic: Multi-wavelength observations suggest that the accretion disk in the hard and intermediate states of X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) transitions from a cold, thin disk at large distances into a hot, thick flow close to the black hole. However, the formation, structure and dynamics of such truncated disks are poorly constrained due to the complexity of the thermodynamic, magnetic, and radiative processes involved. We present the first radiation-transport two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of truncated disks radiating at 35\% of the Eddington luminosity with and without large-scale poloidal magnetic flux. We demonstrate that when a geometrically-thin accretion disk is threaded by large-scale net poloidal magnetic flux, it self-consistently transitions at small radii into a two-phase medium of cold gas clumps floating through a hot, magnetically dominated corona. This transition occurs at a well-defined truncation radius determined by the distance out to which the disk is saturated with magnetic flux. The average ion and electron temperatures in the semi-opaque corona reach, respectively,  and . The system produces radiation, powerful collimated jets and broader winds at the total energy efficiency exceeding 90\%, the highest ever energy extraction efficiency from a spinning black hole by a radiatively efficient flow in a GRMHD simulation. This is consistent with jetted ejections observed during XRB outbursts. The two-phase medium can naturally lead to broadened iron line emission observed in the hard state.

title: Magnetic field sustained by the elastic force in neutron star crusts
authors: Yasufumi Kojima, Shota Kisaka, Kotaro Fujisawa
topic: We investigate the magneto--elastic equilibrium of a neutron star crust and magnetic energy stored by the elastic force. The solenoidal motion driven by the Lorentz force can be controlled by the magnetic elastic force, so that conditions for the magnetic field strength and geometry are less restrictive. For equilibrium models, the minor solenoidal part of the magnetic force is balanced by a weak elastic force because the irrotational part is balanced by the dominant gravity and pressure forces. Therefore, a strong magnetic field may be confined in the interior, regardless of poloidal or toroidal components. We numerically calculated axially symmetric models with the maximum shear--strain, and found that a magnetic energy 1046 erg can be stored in the crust, even for a normal surface dipole-field-strength (1013 G). The magnetic energy much exceeds the elastic energy (1044-1045 erg). The shear--stress spatial distribution revealed that the elastic structure is likely to break down near the surface. In particular, the critical position is highly localized at a depth less than 100 m from the surface.

title: Realistic Kilonova Up Close

topic: Neutron star mergers are cosmic catastrophes that produce some of the most energetic observed phenomena: short gamma-ray bursts, gravitational wave signals, and kilonovae. The latter are optical transients, powered by radioactive nuclides which are synthesized when the neutron-rich ejecta of a disrupted neutron star undergoes decompression. We model this decompression phase using data from simulations of post-merger accretion disk winds. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics with realistic nuclear heating to model the expansion over multiple scales, from initially several thousand km to billions of km. We then render a realistic image of a kilonova ejecta as it would appear for a nearby observer. This is the first time such a visualization is performed using input from state-of-the-art accretion disk simulations, nuclear physics and atomic physics. The volume rendering in our model computes an opacity transfer function on the basis of the physical opacity, varying significantly with the inhomogeneity of the neutron richness in the ejecta. Other physical quantities such as temperature or electron fraction can be visualized using an independent color transfer function. We discuss several difficulties with the ParaView application that we encountered during the visualization process, and give descriptions of our solutions and workarounds which could be used for future improvements.

title: Neural network reconstruction of the dense matter equation of state from neutron star observables
authors: Shriya Soma, Lingxiao Wang, Shuzhe Shi, Horst Stöcker, Kai Zhou
topic: The equation of state (EoS) of the strongly interacting cold and ultra-dense matter remains a major challenge in the field of nuclear physics. With the advancements in measurements of neutron star masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities from electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations, neutron stars play an important role in constraining the ultra-dense matter EoS. In this work, we present a novel method that exploits deep learning techniques to reconstruct the neutron star EoS from mass-radius (M-R) observations. We employ neural networks (NNs) to represent the EoS in a model-independent way, within the range of 1-7.4 times the nuclear saturation density. In an unsupervised manner, we implement the Automatic Differentiation (AD) framework to optimize the EoS, as to yield through TOV equations an M-R curve that best fits the observations. We demonstrate it in rebuilding the EoS on mock data, i.e., mass-radius pairs derived from a generated set of polytropic EoSs. The results show that it is possible to reconstruct the EoS with reasonable accuracy, using just 11 mock M-R pairs observations, which is close to the current number of observations.

title: Adiabatic-radiative shock systems in YSO jets and novae outflows
authors: M.V. del Valle, A. Araudo, F. Suzuki-Vidal
topic: The termination regions of non-relativistic jets in protostars and supersonic outflows in classical novae are nonthermal emitters. Given the high densities in these systems, radiative shocks are expected to form. However, in the presence of high velocities, the formation of adiabatic shocks is also possible. A case of interest is when the two types of shocks occur simultaneously. These dense jets/outflows are excellent candidates for laboratory experiments as demonstrated by MHD scaling. We aim at studying the combination of adiabatic and radiative shocks in these systems. We focus on determining the conditions under which this combination is feasible together with its physical implications. We perform an analytical study of the shocks in both types of sources for a set of parameters. The hydrodynamical evolution of a jet colliding with an ambient medium is studied with 2D numerical simulations confirming our initial theoretical estimates. We show that for a wide set of parameters the combination of an adiabatic and a radiative shock is possible at the working surface of the termination region in jets from young stars and novae outflows. We find that instabilities are developed at the contact discontinuity, mixing the shocked materials. Also, we explore the MHD parameter scaling required for studying protostellar jets and novae outflows using laboratory experiments on laser facilities. The coexistence of an adiabatic and a radiative shock is expected at the termination region of protostellar jets and novae outflows. This scenario is very promising for particle acceleration and gamma-ray emission. The parameters for scaled laboratory experiments are very much in line with plasma conditions achievable in currently operating high-power laser facilities. This opens the door to new means for studying novae outflows never considered before.

title: Optical line spectra of tidal disruption events from reprocessing in optically thick outflows
authors: Edward J. Parkinson, Christian Knigge, James H. Matthews, Knox S. Long, Nick Higginbottom, Stuart A. Sim, Samuel W. Mangham
topic: A significant number of tidal disruption events (TDEs) radiate primarily at optical and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, with only weak soft X-ray components. One model for this optical excess proposes that thermal X-ray emission from a compact accretion disc is reprocessed to longer wavelengths by an optically thick envelope. Here, we explore this reprocessing scenario in the context of an optically thick accretion disc wind. Using state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer and ionization software, we produce synthetic UV and optical spectra for wind and disc-hosting TDEs. Our models are inspired by observations, spanning a realistic range of accretion rates and wind kinematics. We find that such outflows can efficiently reprocess the disc emission and produce the broad Balmer and helium recombination features commonly seen in TDEs and exhibit asymmetric red wings. Moreover, the characteristic colour temperature of the reprocessed spectral energy distribution (SED) is much lower than that of the accretion disc. We show explicitly how changes in black hole mass, accretion rate and wind properties affect the observed broadband SED and line spectrum. In general, slower, denser winds tend to reprocess more radiation and produce stronger Balmer emission. Most of the outflows we consider are too highly ionized to produce UV absorption features, but this is sensitive to the input SED. For example, truncating the inner disc at just 4 RISCO lowers the wind ionization state sufficiently to produce UV absorption features for sight lines looking into the wind

title: Differentiating sharp phase transitions from mixed states in neutron stars
authors: Jonas P. Pereira, Michał Bejger, J. Leszek Zdunik, Paweł Haensel
topic: The internal composition of neutron stars is still an open issue in astrophysics. Their innermost regions are impervious to light propagation and gravitational waves mostly carry global aspects of stars, meaning that only indirect inferences of their interiors could be obtained. Here we estimate the observational accuracy and discuss ways to differentiate a mixed phase/state from a sharp phase transition region in a hybrid star by means of some electromagnetic and gravitational wave observables. We show that different transition constructions lead to similar sequences of stellar configurations due to their shared thermodynamic properties. In the most optimistic case - a strong quark-hadron density jump phase transition - radius and mass observations require fractional uncertainties smaller than 1-2% to differentiate mixed states from sharp phase transitions. For tidal deformations, relative uncertainties should be smaller than 5-10%. However, for masses around the onset of stable quark cores, relative tidal deformation changes associated with strong sharp phase transitions and mixed states connecting the two pure phases could be much larger (up to around 20-30%). If one compares purely hadronic stars (masses below their phase transition thresholds) with those having mixed states, relative tidal deformation and radius differences might be even more pronounced (roughly up to 50% and 5%, respectively). All the above suggests that 2.5- and 3rd generation gravitational wave detectors and near-term electromagnetic missions may be able to start assessing some aspects of phase transitions in neutron stars. Finally, we briefly discuss other observables that may also be relevant for such probes.

title: Probing into emission mechanisms of GRB 190530A using time-resolved spectra and polarization studies: Synchrotron Origin?
authors: Rahul Gupta, S. Gupta, T. Chattopadhyay, V. Lipunov et al
topic: Multi-pulsed GRB 190530A, detected by the GBM and LAT onboard fermi, is the sixth most fluent GBM burst detected so far. This paper presents the timing, spectral, and polarimetric analysis of the prompt emission observed using \AstroSat and \fermi to provide insight into the prompt emission radiation mechanisms. The time-integrated spectrum shows conclusive proof of two breaks due to peak energy and a second lower energy break. Time-integrated (55.43 pm 21.30 \%) as well as time-resolved polarization measurements, made by the Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager (CZTI) onboard \AstroSat, show a hint of high degree of polarization. The presence of a hint of high degree of polarization and the values of low energy spectral index (alpha pt) do not run over the synchrotron limit for the first two pulses, supporting the synchrotron origin in an ordered magnetic field. However, during the third pulse, alpha pt exceeds the synchrotron line of death in few bins, and a thermal signature along with the synchrotron component in the time-resolved spectra is observed. Furthermore, we also report the earliest optical observations constraining afterglow polarization using the MASTER (P < 1.3 \%) and the redshift measurement (z= 0.9386) obtained with the 10.4m GTC telescopes. The broadband afterglow can be described with a forward shock model for an ISM-like medium with a wide jet opening angle. We determine a circumburst density of n0 = 7.41, kinetic energy EK - 7.24 x1054 erg, and radiated gamma-ray energy Eγ,iso 6.05 x1054 erg, respectively.

title: On the Sweet-Parker model for incompressible visco-resistive magnetic reconnection in two dimensions associated to ideal magnetohydrodynamic instabilities
authors: Hubert Baty
topic: We revisit the well known Sweet-Parker (SP) model for magnetic reconnection in the framework of two dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamics. The steady-state solution is re-derived by considering a non zero viscosity via the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. Moreover, contrary to the original SP model, a particular attention is paid to the possibility that the inflowing magnetic field Be and the length of the current layer L are not necessarily fixed and may depend on the dissipation parameters. Using two different ideally unstable setups to form the current sheet, namely the tilt and coalescence modes, we numerically explore the scaling relations with resistivity  and Prandtl number Pm during the magnetic reconnection phase, and compare to the generalized steady-state SP theoretical solution. The usual Sweet-Parker relations are recovered in the limit of small Pm and η values, with in particular the normalized reconnection rate being simply [eq], where S represents the Lundquist number [eq] (VA being the characteristic Alfven speed). In the opposite limit of higher Pm and/or eta values, a significant deviation from the SP model is obtained with a complex dependence [eq] that is explored depending on the setup considered. We discuss the importance of these results in order to correctly interpret the numerous exponentially increasing numerical studies published in the literature, with the aim of explaining eruptive phenomena observed in the solar corona.

title: Reliable quark-nuclear hybrid EoS for neutron stars under modern observational constraints
authors: G.A. Contrera, D. Blaschke, J.P. Carlomagno, A.G. Grunfeld, S. Liebing
topic: We study a family of equations of state (EoS) for hybrid neutron star (NS) matter. Our hybrid EoS are based on an instantaneous nonlocal version of NJL model in SU(2)f with vector interactions and color superconductivity describing the quark matter (QM) with a Maxwell construction phase transition to hadronic matter phase described by the "DD2" EoS with excluded volume and a crust at low baryonic densities. The form factor in the QM nonlocal model was fitted to lattice QCD (LQCD) results in the Coulomb gauge. To simultaneously fulfill constraints from NICER and tidal deformability from GW170817 it is necessary to consider a mu dependent bag constant that mimics confinement. Our results show an asymptotic constant behaviour for the speed of sound that reproduces the conjectured value of 1/3 from QCD in the free case, and larger constant values in the range 0.4 - 0.6 when interactions are turned on.

topic: We report the detection of strong thermal spectral component in the short Gamma-Ray Burst 170206A with three intensive pulses in its lightcurves, throughout which the fluxes of this thermal component exhibit fast temporal variability same as that of the accompanied non-thermal component. The values of the time-resolved low-energy photon index in the non-thermal component are between about -0.78 and -0.17, most of which are harder than the line-of-death (-2/3) of the synchrotron emission process. In addition, we found the plausible common evolution between the thermal component and the non-thermal component, indicating a positive correlation between the fluxes as well as peak energies of both components. Based on the observations, we explore the possible origin of the thermal component and the non-thermal component based on the models of one common radiation region and two radiation regions.

topic: On the 17th of August, 2017 came the simultaneous detections of GW170817, a gravitational wave that originated from the coalescence of two neutron stars, along with the gamma-ray burst GRB170817A, and the kilonova counterpart AT2017gfo. Since then, there has been much excitement surrounding the study of neutron star mergers, both observationally, using a variety of tools, and theoretically, with the development of complex models describing the gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals. In this work, we improve upon our pipeline to infer kilonova properties from observed light-curves by employing a Neural-Network framework that reduces execution time and handles much larger simulation sets than previously possible. In particular, we use the radiative transfer code POSSIS to construct 5-dimensional kilonova grids where we employ different functional forms for the angular dependence of the dynamical ejecta component. We find that incorporating an angular dependence improves the fit to the AT2017gfo light-curves by up to 50\% when quantified in terms of the weighted Mean Square Error.

topic: Modelling the broadband emission of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) constitutes one of the main research topics of extragalactic astrophysics in the multi-wavelength and multi-messenger domain.We present agnpy, an open-source python package modelling the radiative processes of relativistic particles accelerated in the jets of active galactic nuclei. The package includes classes describing the galaxy components responsible for line and thermal emission and calculates the absorption due to GammaGamma pair production on several photon fields. agnpy aims at extending the effort of modelling and interpreting the emission of extragalactic sources to a wide number of astrophysicists.We present the package content and illustrate a few examples of applications of its functionalities. We validate the software by comparing its results against the literature and against other open-source software.We illustrate the utility of agnpy in addressing the most common questions encountered while modelling the emission of jetted active galaxies. When comparing its results against the literature and other modelling tools adopting the same physical assumptions, we achieve an agreement within 10-30\%. agnpy represents one of the first systematic and validated collection of established radiative processes for jetted active galaxies in an open-source python package. We hope it will stand also among the first endeavours providing reproducible and transparent astrophysical software not only for data reduction and analysis, but also for modelling and interpretation.

title: Tidal Deformability as a Probe of Dark Matter in Neutron Stars
authors: Davood Rafiei Karkevandi, Soroush Shakeri, Violetta Sagun, Oleksii Ivanytskyi
topic: The concept of boson stars (BSs) was first introduced by Kaup and Ruffini-Bonazzola in the 1960s. Following this idea, we investigate an effect of self-interacting asymmetric bosonic dark matter (DM) according to Colpi et al. model for BSs (1986) on different observable properties of neutron stars (NSs). In this paper, the bosonic DM and baryonic matter (BM) are mixed together and interact only through gravitational force. The presence of DM as a core of a compact star or as an extended halo around it is examined by applying different boson masses and DM fractions for a fixed coupling constant. The impact of DM core/halo formations on a DM admixed NS properties is probed through the maximum mass and tidal deformability of NSs. Thanks to the recent detection of Gravitational-Waves (GWs) and the latest X-ray observations, the DM admixed NS's features are compared to LIGO/Virgo and NICER results.

title: Detection prospects for multi-GeV neutrinos from collisionally heated GRBs
authors: A. Zegarelli, S. Celli, A. Capone, S. Gagliardini, S. Campion, I. Di Palma
topic: Neutrinos with energies ranging from GeV to sub-TeV are expected to be produced in Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) as a result of the dissipation of the jet kinetic energy through nuclear collisions occurring around or below the photosphere, where the jet is still optically thick to high-energy radiation. So far, the neutrino emission from the inelastic collisional model in GRBs has been poorly investigated from the experimental point of view. In the present work, we discuss prospects for identifying neutrinos produced in such collisionally heated GRBs with the large volume neutrino telescopes KM3NeT and IceCube, including their low-energy extensions, KM3NeT/ORCA and DeepCore, respectively. To this aim, we evaluate the detection sensitivity for neutrinos from both individual and stacked GRBs, exploring bulk Lorentz factor values ranging from 100 to 600. As a result of our analysis, individual searches appear feasible only for extreme sources, characterized by gamma-ray fluence values at the level of [Fgamma>=1e-2 erg cm-2]. In turn, it is possible to detect a significant flux of neutrinos from a stacking sample of 900 long GRBs (that could be detected by current gamma-ray satellites in about five years) already with DeepCore and KM3NeT/ORCA. The detection sensitivity increases with the inclusion of data from the high-energy telescopes, IceCube and KM3NeT/ARCA, respectively.

title: Many faces of accretion in gamma ray bursts
authors: Agnieszka Janiuk
topic: Accretion powers relativistic jets in GRBs, similarly to other jet sources. Black holes that are at heart of long GRBs, are formed as the end product of stellar evolution. At birth, some of the black holes must be very rapidly spinning, to be able to power the GRBS. In some cases, the black holes may be born without formation of a disk/jet engine, and then the star will collapse without an electromagnetic transient. In this proceeding, we discuss the conditions for launching variable jets from the magnetized disk in an arrested state. We also discuss properties of collapsing massive stars as progenitors of GRBs, and the conditions which must be satisfied for the star in order for the collapsar to produce a bright gamma-ray transient. We find that the black hole rotation is further affected by self-gravity of the collapsing matter. Finally, we comment on the properties of the accretion disk under extreme conditions of nuclear densities and temperatures, while it can contribute to the kilonova accompanying short GRBs.

title: GW190521 as a black-hole merger coincident with the ZTF19abanrhr flare
authors: Juan Calderón Bustillo, Samson H.W. Leong, Koustav Chandra, Barry McKernan, K. E. S. Ford
topic: We present an analysis that reconciles the gravitational-wave signal GW190521 observed by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors with the electromagnetic flare ZTF19abanrhr observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility. We analyze GW190521 under a mass-ratio prior uniform in q=[1,4] and using the state-of-the-art waveform model for black-hole mergers NRSur7dq4. We find a 90\% credible region for the black-hole masses extending far outside what originally reported by GW190521D, where our maximum likelihood masses reside. We find a 15\% probability that both black holes avoid the pair-instability supernova gap. We infer a three-dimensional sky-location highly consistent with ZTF19abanrhr, obtaining an odds-ratio [C/R=72:1] that strongly favors the hypothesis of a true coincidence over a random one. Combining this event with the neutron-star merger GW170817, we estimate a Hubble constant H0=72.1+10.6-6.4kms-1Mpc-1 at the 68% credible level.

title: GeV Signature of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts in Active Galactic Nuclei
authors: Chengchao Yuan, Kohta Murase, Dafne Guetta, Asaf Pe'er, Imre Bartos, Péter Mészáros
topic: The joint detection of gravitational waves and the gamma-ray counterpart of a binary neutron star merger event, GW170817, unambiguously validates the connection between short gamma-ray bursts and compact binary object (CBO) mergers. We focus on a special scenario where short gamma-ray bursts produced by CBO mergers are embedded in disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and we investigate the Gamma-ray emission produced in the internal dissipation region via synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton and external inverse-Compton (EIC) processes. In this scenario, isotropic thermal photons from the AGN disks contribute to the EIC component. We show that a low-density cavity can be formed in the migration traps, leading to the embedded mergers producing successful GRB jets. We find that the EIC component would dominate the GeV emission for typical CBO mergers with an isotropic-equivalent luminosity of Lj,iso=1048.5 erg s-1 which are located close to the central supermassive black hole. Considering a long-lasting jet of duration Tdur∼102-103 s, we find that the future CTA will be able to detect its 25-100 GeV emission out to a redshift z=1.0. In the optimistic case, it is possible to detect the on-axis extended emission simultaneously with GWs within one decade using MAGIC, H.E.S.S., VERITAS, CTA, and LHAASO-WCDA. Early diagnosis of prompt emissions with Fermi-GBM and HAWC can provide valuable directional information for the follow-up observations.

title: Investigating the mass-ratio dependence of the prompt-collapse threshold with numerical-relativity simulations
authors: Maximilian Kölsch, Tim Dietrich, Maximiliano Ujevic, Bernd Bruegmann
topic: The next observing runs of advanced gravitational-wave detectors will lead to a variety of binary neutron star detections and numerous possibilities for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star systems. In this context a clear understanding of the merger process and the possibility of prompt black hole formation after merger is important, as the amount of ejected material strongly depends on the merger dynamics. These dynamics are primarily affected by the total mass of the binary, however, the mass ratio also influences the postmerger evolution. To determine the effect of the mass ratio, we investigate the parameter space around the prompt-collapse threshold with a new set of fully relativistic simulations. The simulations cover three equations of state and seven mass ratios in the range of 1.0 - q - 1.75, with five to seven simulations of binary systems of different total mass in each case. The threshold mass is determined through an empirical relation based on the collapse-time, which allows us to investigate effects of the mass-ratio on the threshold mass and also on the properties of the remnant system. Furthermore, we model effects of mass ratio and equation of state on tidal parameters of threshold configurations.

title: Ensembles of unified crust and core equations of state in a nuclear-multimessenger astrophysics environment
authors: William G. Newton, Lauren Balliet, Srdan Budimir, Gabrial Crocombe, Brianna Douglas, Thomas Blake Head, Luis Rivera, Zach Langford, Josh Sanford
topic: We present an ensemble of unified neutron star crust and core equations of state, constructed using an extended Skyrme energy density functional through the crust and outer core, and appended by two piecewise polytropes at higher densities. The equations of state are parameterized by the first three coefficients in the density expansion of the symmetry energy J,L and Ksym, the moment of inertia of a 1.338 Msun star I1.338 and the maximum neutron star mass Mmax. We construct an ensemble with uniform priors on all five parameters, and then apply data filters to the ensemble to explore the effect of combining neutron skin data from PREX with astrophysical measurements of radii and tidal deformabilities from NICER and LIGO/VIRGO. Neutron skins are calculated directly using the EDFs. We demonstrate that both the nuclear data and astrophysical data play a role in constraining crust properties such as the mass, thickness and moment of inertia of the crust and the nuclear pasta layers therein, and that astrophysical data better constrains Ksym than PREX data.

title: Modeling the Multi-band Light Curves of the Optical--NIR Afterglows of Four Gamma-Ray Bursts and Their Associated Supernovae
authors: Ji-Shun Lian, Shan-Qin Wang, Wen-Pei Gan, Jing-Yao Li, En-Wei Liang
topic: In this paper, we use (broken) power-law plus 56Ni models to fit the multi-band light curves of the optical and near-infrared (NIR) counterparts of four gamma-ray bursts (GRBs 011121, 100316D, 130702A, and GRB 161219B). We find that the models can account for the light curves of the optical--NIR counterparts which can be divided into the GRB afterglows and their associated supernovae (SNe 2001ke, 2010bh, 2013dx, and 2016jca, respectively). The most parameters we derive are consistent with previous studies. However, the 56Ni masses we derive are higher than that in the literatures (except for that of GRB 100316D/SN 2010bh). The difference of the 56Ni masses might be due to the fact that the 56Ni masses in the literatures are obtained by fitting the quasi-bolometric light curves which are usually (significantly) underestimated, and dimmer than the theoretical bolometric light curves reproduced by the best-fitting parameters we derive. Our results demonstrate that the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of SNe associated with GRBs can be well described by the blackbody model, and the 56Ni model can account for their multi-band light curves. We suggest that the 56Ni masses of a fraction of GRB-SNe have been underestimated.

title: Equation of state and neutrino transfer in supernovae and neutron stars
authors: Kohsuke Sumiyoshi
topic: We overview the progress of the tables of the equation of state for astrophysical simulations and the numerical methods of neutrino transfer. Hot and dense matter play essential roles in core-collapse supernovae and neutron stars. Equation of state determines the structure of compact objects and their dynamics through its behavior of thermodynamic quantities. In addition, neutrinos are trapped in supernova cores and neutron star mergers and frequently interact with matter to crucially affect dynamics in determining the explosion mechanism and the final form of compact objects. Therefore, it is essential to implement detailed processes of nuclear and neutrino physics in numerical simulations by having reliable data set of the equation of state and reaction rates. We show examples of developments of the equation of state and the neutrino transfer and discuss research directions toward understanding the explosive phenomena by the first principle calculation.

topic: We perform binary neutron star (BNS) merger simulations in full dynamical general relativity with IllinoisGRMHD, on a Cartesian grid with adaptive-mesh refinement. After the remnant black hole (BH) has become nearly stationary, the evolution of the surrounding accretion disk on cartesian grids over long timescales (1s) is suboptimal, as the plasma flows obliquely across coordinate lines and numerical errors quickly dissipate angular momentum from the disk. To address this, we present the Handoff, a set of computational tools that enables the transfer of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) and spacetime data from IllinoisGRMHD to Harm3d, a GRMHD code that specializes in modeling BH accretion disks in static spacetimes over long timescales, making use of general coordinate systems with spherical topology. We demonstrate that the HandOff allows for a smooth and reliable transition of GRMHD fields and spacetime data, enabling us to efficiently and reliably evolve BNS dynamics well beyond merger. We also discuss future plans, which involve incorporating advanced equations of state and neutrino physics into BNS simulations using the HandOff approach.

title: Binary neutron star mergers within kaon condensation: GW170817
authors: Z. Sharifi, M. Bigdeli, D. Alvarez-Castillo, E. Nasiri
topic: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron star (NS) matter is investigated considering kaon condensation. Moreover, the tidal parameters related to the components of binary neutron star mergers are determined and compared to the constraints of GW170817 imposed on these quantities. In this study, we employ the lowest-order constrained variational (LOCV) approach and utilize [AV6, AV8, and AV18 potentials] accompanied by the three nucleon interaction (TNI) [in order to consider the nucleon-nucleon interaction]. It is known that the existence of kaons in the core of NSs softens the EoS [and thus] lowers the value of maximum mass which is expected to be greater than 2 Msun. Our results demonstrate that considering kaon condensation with a strangeness value, a3ms=-134 MeV satisfies the maximum mass constraint except for AV8+TNI potential. However, the calculation of dimensionless tidal deformability shows that with the decrease of strangeness value, the neutron star gets less deformed.

topic: We present a comprehensive analysis of 653 optical candidate counterparts reported during the third gravitational wave (GW) observing run. Our sample concentrates on candidates from the 15 events that had a 1 and more percent chance of including a neutron star in order to assess their viability as true kilonovae. In particular, we leverage tools available in real time, including pre-merger detections and cross-matching with catalogs (i.e. point source, variable star, quasar and host galaxy redshift datasets), to eliminate more [67\%] of candidates in our sample. We further employ spectroscopic classifications, late-time detections and light curve behavior analysis, and conclude that 60 candidates remain viable kilonovae. These candidates lack sufficient information to determine their classifications, and the majority would require luminosities greater than that of AT2017gfo. Pre-merger detections in public photometric survey data and comparison of catalogued host galaxy redshifts with the GW event distances are critical to incorporate into vetting procedures, as these tools eliminated [\g 20%] and [\g 33%] of candidates, respectively. We expect that such tools which leverage archival information will significantly reduce the strain on spectroscopic and photometric follow-up resources in future observing runs. Finally, we discuss the critical role prompt updates from GW astronomers to the EM community play in reducing the number of candidates requiring vetting.

topic: We have shown the simultaneous generation of macro-scale fast flows and strong magnetic fields in the 2-temperature relativistic electron-ion plasmas of astrophysical objects due to Unified Reverse Dynamo/Dynamo mechanism. The resulting dynamical magnetic field amplification and/or flow acceleration is directly proportional to the initial turbulent kinetic/magnetic (magnetic) energy; the process is very sensitive to relativistically hot electron-ion fraction temperature and magneto-fluid coupling. It is shown, that for realistic physical parameters of White Dwarfs accreting hot astrophysical flow / Binary systems there always exists such a real solution of dispersion relation for which the formation of dispersive strong super-Alfvenic macro-scale flow/outflow with Alfven Mach number >and/or generation of super-strong magnetic fields is guaranteed.

title: Test particle energization of heavy ions in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence
authors: Facundo Pugliese, Pablo Dmitruk
topic: In the present work, we study the energization and displacement of heavy ions through the use of test particles interacting with the electromagnetic fields of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. These fields are obtained from pseudospectral direct numerical solutions (DNSs) of the compressible three-dimensional MHD equations with a strong background magnetic field. We find particle energization to be predominantly perpendicular as the ions become heavier (lower charge-to-mass ratio) and that high displacement is detrimental for perpendicular energization. On the other hand, perpendicular displacement is unaffected by the charge-to-mass ratio, which we explain with a simple guide center model. Using Voronoi tessellation along with this model, we analyze preferential concentration and find that particles behave as tracers in the perpendicular plane, clustering in regions with. These regions also have.., which is optimal for perpendicular energization, thus providing a mechanism to understand precedent results.

title: Relativistic Particle Transport and Acceleration in Structured Plasma Turbulence
authors: Oreste Pezzi, Pasquale Blasi, William H. Matthaeus
topic: We discuss the phenomenon of energization of relativistic charged particles in three-dimensional (3D) incompressible MHD turbulence and the diffusive properties of the motion of the same particles. We show that the random electric field induced by turbulent plasma motion leads test particles, moving in a simulated box to be accelerated in a stochastic way, a second order Fermi process. A small fraction of these particles happen to be trapped in large scale structures, most likely formed due to the interaction of islands in the turbulence. Such particles get accelerated exponentially, provided their pitch angle satisfies some conditions. We discuss at length the characterization of the accelerating structure and the physical processes responsible for rapid acceleration. We also comment on the applicability of the results to realistic astrophysical turbulence.

title: Turbulent magnetic field amplification in binary neutron star mergers
authors: C. Palenzuela, R. Aguilera-Miret, F. Carrasco, R. Ciolfi, J.V. Kalinani, W. Kastaun, B. Miñano, D. Viganò
topic: Magnetic fields are expected to play a key role in the dynamics and the ejection mechanisms that accompany the merger of two neutron stars. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations offer a unique opportunity to unravel the details of the ongoing physical processes. Nevertheless, current numerical studies are severely limited by the fact that any affordable resolution remains insufficient to fully capture the small-scale dynamo, initially triggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and later sourced by several MHD processes involving differential rotation. Here, we alleviate this limitation by using explicit large-eddy simulations, a technique where the unresolved dynamics occurring at the sub-grid scales (SGS) is modeled by extra terms, which are functions of the resolved fields and their derivatives. The combination of high-order numerical schemes, high resolutions, and the gradient SGS model allow us to capture the small-scale dynamos produced during the binary neutron star mergers. Here we follow the first 50 milliseconds after the merger and, for the first time, we find numerical convergence on the magnetic field amplification, in terms of integrated energy and spectral distribution over spatial scales. We also find that the average intensity of the magnetic field in the remnant saturates at 1016G around 5ms after the merger. After 20-30ms, both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field components grow continuously, fed by the winding mechanism that provides a slow inverse cascade. We find no clear hints for magneto-rotational instabilities, and no significant impact of the magnetic field on the redistribution of angular momentum in the remnant in our simulations, probably due to the very turbulent and dynamical topology of the magnetic field at all stages, with small-scale components largely dominating over the large-scale ones.

title: Universality of the turbulent magnetic field in hypermassive neutron stars produced by binary mergers
authors: Ricard Aguilera-Miret, Daniele Viganò, Carlos Palenzuela 
topic: The detection of a binary neutron star merger in 2017 through both gravitational waves and electromagnetic emission opened a new era of multimessenger astronomy. The understanding of the magnetic field amplification triggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability during the merger is still a numerically unresolved problem because of the relevant small scales involved. One of the uncertainties comes from the simplifications usually assumed in the initial magnetic topology of merging neutron stars. We perform high-resolution, convergent large-eddy simulations of binary neutron star mergers, following the newly formed remnant for up to 30 milliseconds. Here we specifically focus on the comparison between simulations with different initial magnetic configurations, going beyond the widespread-used aligned dipole confined within each star. The results obtained show that the initial topology is quickly forgotten, in a timescale of few miliseconds after the merger. Moreover, at the end of the simulations, the average intensity (B∼1016 G) and the spectral distribution of magnetic energy over spatial scales barely depend on the initial configuration. This is expected due to the small-scale efficient dynamo involved, and thus it holds as long as: (i) the initial large-scale magnetic field is not unrealistically high (as often imposed in mergers studies); (ii) the turbulent instability is numerically (at least partially) resolved, so that the amplified magnetic energy is distributed across a wide range of scales and becomes orders-of-magnitude larger than the initial one.

title: Common envelope jets supernova r-process yields can reproduce [Eu/Fe] abundance evolution in the Galaxy
authors: Aldana Grichener, Chiaki Kobayashi, Noam Soker
topic: We use a numerical Galactic chemical evolution model and find that the common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario can account for both the very early average ratio of europium to iron and its evolution at later times in the Milky-Way (MW) Galaxy. In the CEJSN scenario a neutron star (NS) spirals-in inside a red supergiant (RSG) star all the way to the core and destroys it. According to this scenario r-process isotopes are nucleosynthesized inside neutron-rich jets that the accretion disk around the NS launches inside the core. The merger of a NS with an RSG core already takes place in the very young Galaxy. The wide variety of these mergers properties can explain the scatter in the ratio of europium to iron around the mean at low metalicites. We conclude that CEJSNe can be a major contributor to r-process nucleosynthesis.

title: Relativistic Magnetized Astrophysical Plasma Outflows in Black-Hole Microquasars
authors: Theodora Papavasileiou, Odysseas Kosmas, Ioannis Sinatkas 
topic: Recently, microquasar jets have aroused the interest of many researchers focusing on the astrophysical plasma outflows and various jet ejections. In this work, we concentrate on the investigation of electromagnetic radiation and particle emissions from the jets of stellar black hole binary systems characterized by the hadronic content in their jets. Such emissions are reliably described within the context of the relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics. Our model calculations are based on the Fermi acceleration mechanism through which the primary particles (mainly protons) of the jet are accelerated. As a result, a small portion of thermal protons of the jet acquire relativistic energies, through shock-waves generated into the jet plasma. From the inelastic collisions of fast (non-thermal) protons with the thermal (cold) ones, secondary charged and neutral particles (pions, kaons, muons, eta-particles, etc.) are created as well as electromagnetic radiation from the radio wavelength band, to X-rays and even to very high energy gamma-rays. One of our main goals is, through the appropriate solution of the transport equation and taking into account the various mechanisms that cause energy losses to the particles, to study the secondary particle concentrations within hadronic astrophysical jets. After testing our method on the Galactic MQs SS 433 and Cyg X-1, as a concrete extragalactic binary system, we examine the LMC X-1 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way Galaxy. It is worth mentioning that, for the companion O star (and its extended nebula structure) of the LMC X-1 system, new observations using spectroscopic data from VLT/UVES have been published few years ago.

title: Multi-messenger detection prospects of gamma-ray burst afterglows with optical jumps
authors: Ersilia Guarini, Irene Tamborra, Damien Bégué, Tetyana Pitik, Jochen Greiner
topic: Afterglow light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibit very complex temporal and spectral features, such as a sudden intensity jump about one hour after the prompt emission in the optical band. We model this feature through the late collision of two relativistic shells and investigate the corresponding high-energy neutrino emission within a multi-messenger framework, while contrasting our findings with the ones from the classic fireball model. For a constant density circumburst medium, the total number of emitted neutrinos can increase by about an order of magnitude within a dynamical time when an optical jump occurs with respect to the self-similar afterglow scenario. By exploring the detection prospects with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and future radio arrays such as IceCube-Gen2 radio, RNO-G and GRAND200k, as well as the POEMMA spacecraft, we conclude that the detection of neutrinos with IceCube-Gen2 radio could enable us to constrain the fraction of GRB afterglows with a jump as well as the properties of the circumburst medium. We also investigate the neutrino signal expected for the afterglows of GRB 100621A and a GRB 130427A-like burst with an optical jump. The detection of neutrinos from GRB afterglows could be crucial to explore the yet-to-be unveiled mechanism powering the optical jumps.

title: On the Validity of Steady-State for Nebular Phase Kilonovae
authors: Quentin Pognan, Anders Jerkstrand, Jon Grumer
topic: The radioactively powered transient following a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, known as a kilonova (KN), is expected to enter the steady-state nebular phase a few days after merger. Steady-state holds until thermal reprocessing time-scales become long, at which point the temperature and ionisation states need to be evolved time-dependently. We study the onset and significance of time-dependent effects using the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) spectral synthesis code SUMO. We employ a simple single-zone model with an elemental composition of Te, Ce, Pt and Th, scaled to their respective solar abundances. The atomic data are generated using the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC), and consist of energy levels and radiative transitions, including highly forbidden lines. We explore the KN evolution from 5 to 100 days after merger, varying ejecta mass and velocity. We also consider variations in the degree of electron magnetic field trapping, as well as radioactive power generation for alpha and beta decay (but omitting fission products). We find that the transition time, and magnitude of steady-state deviations are highly sensitive to these parameters. For typical KN ejecta, the deviations are minor within the time-frame studied. However, low density ejecta with low energy deposition show significant differences from 10 days. Important deviation of the ionisation structure solution impacts the temperature by altering the overall line cooling. Adiabatic cooling becomes important at t gt 60 days which, in addition to the temperature and ionisation effects, lead to the bolometric light curve deviating from the instantaneous radioactive power deposited.

title: Bethe-Heitler signature in proton synchrotron models for gamma-ray bursts
authors: Damien Bégué, Filip Samuelsson, Asaf Pe'er
topic: We study the effect of Bethe-Heitler (BeHe) pair production on a proton synchrotron model for the prompt emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The possible parameter space of the model is constrained by consideration of the synchrotron radiation from the secondary BeHe pairs. We find two regimes of interest. 1) At high bulk Lorentz factor, large radius and low luminosity, proton synchrotron emission dominates and produces a spectrum in agreement with observations. For part of this parameter space, a subdominant (in the MeV band) power-law is created by the synchrotron emission of the BeHe pairs. This power-law extends up to few tens or hundreds of MeV. Such a signature is a natural expectation in a proton synchrotron model, and it is seen in some GRBs, including GRB 190114C recently observed by the MAGIC observatory. 2) At low bulk Lorentz factor, small radius and high luminosity, BeHe cooling dominates. The spectrum achieves the shape of a single power-law with spectral index p=-3/2 extending across the entire GBM/Swift energy window, incompatible with observations. Our theoretical results can be used to further constrain the spectral analysis of GRBs in the guise of proton synchrotron models.

title: Filamentation of Fast Radio Bursts in magnetar winds
authors: 
topic: Magnetars are the most promising progenitors of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Strong FRB radio waves propagating through the magnetar wind are subject to non-linear effects, including modulation/filamentation instabilities. In pair plasmas, spatial modulations of the wave intensity grow exponentially because the ponderomotive force pushes particles outside regions of enhanced radiation intensity. Then in these regions the plasma refractive index increases, which creates a converging lens that further enhances the radiation intensity. Since in magnetically-dominated plasmas the ponderomotive force pushes particles primarily along the field lines, the FRB radiation intensity develops sheets perpendicular to the direction of the wind magnetic field. The radiation sheets are eventually scattered due to diffraction. The FRB scattering timescale depends on the properties of the magnetar wind. In a cold wind, the typical scattering timescale is .. at the frequency 1GHz. The scattering timescale increases at low frequencies, with the scaling .... The frequency-dependent broadening of the brightest pulse of FRB 181112 is consistent with this scaling. From the scattering timescale of the pulse, one can estimate that the wind Lorentz factor is larger than a few tens. In a warm wind, the scattering timescale can approach .... Then scattering produces a frequency modulation of the observed intensity with a large bandwidth, .... Broadband frequency modulations observed in FRBs could be due to scattering in a warm magnetar wind.

title: Analytic Modeling of Synchroton-Self-Compton Spectra: Application to GRB 190114C
authors: Shotaro Yamasaki, Tsvi Piran
topic: Observations of TeV emission from early gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows revealed the long sought for inverse Compton (IC) upscattering of the lower energy synchrotron. However, it turned out that the long hoped for ability to easily interpret the synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) spectra didn't materialize. The TeV emission is in the Klein-Nishina (KN) regime and the simple Thomson regime SSC spectrum is modified, complicating the scene. We describe here a methodology, based on Nakar et al. 2009, to obtain an analytic approximation to an observed spectrum and infer the conditions at the emitting region. The methodology is general and can be used in any such source. As a test case, we apply it to the observations of GRB 190114C. We find that the procedure of fitting the model parameters using the analytic SSC spectrum suffers from some generic problems. However, at the same time, it conveniently gives a useful insight into the conditions that shape the spectrum. Once we introduce a correction to the standard KN approximation, the best fit solution is consistent with the one found in detailed numerical simulations. As in the numerical analysis, we find a family of solutions that provide a good approximation to the data and satisfy roughly ... between the magnetic field and the bulk Lorentz factor, and we provide a tentative explanation why such a family arises.

topic: Using 250 neutron star merger simulations with microphysics, we explore for the first time the role of nuclear incompressibility in the prompt collapse threshold for binaries with different mass ratios. We demonstrate that observations of prompt collapse thresholds, either from binaries with two different mass ratios or with one mass ratio but combined with the knowledge of the maximum neutron star mass or compactness, will constrain the incompressibility at the maximum neutron star density, Kmax, to within tens of percent. This, otherwise inaccessible, measure of Kmax can potentially reveal the presence of hyperons or quarks inside neutron stars.

title: Hybrid stars from a constrained equation of state
authors: Márcio Ferreira, Renan Câmara Pereira, Constança Providência
topic: We determine, within a meta-model, the properties of the nuclear matter equation of state (EoS) that allow for a phase transition to deconfinement matter. It is shown that the properties that define the isoscalar channel are the ones that are affected, in particular, a phase transition implies much larger values of the skewness and kurtosis. The effect of multi-quark interaction channels in the description of the quark phase in hybrid stars is also studied. NS properties, such as the mass and radius of the quark core, show an interplay dependence between the 8-quark vector and the 4-quark isovector-vector interactions. We show that low mass NS, M1.4Msun, may already contain a quark core, and satisfy all existing NS observational constraints. We discuss the strangeness content of the quark core and its influence on the speed of sound.

authors: Jin-Biao Wei, G. F. Burgio, Ad. R. Raduta, H.-J. Schulze
topic: A set of microscopic, covariant density-functional, and non-relativistic Skyrme-type equations of state is employed to study the structure of purely nucleonic neutron stars at finite temperature. After examining the agreement with presently available astrophysical observational constraints, we find that the magnitude of thermal effects depends on the nucleon effective mass as well as on the stiffness of the cold equation of state. We evidence a fairly small but model-dependent effect of finite temperature on stellar stability that is correlated with the relative thermal pressure inside the star.

title: Host galaxies and electromagnetic counterparts to binary neutron star mergers across the cosmic time: Detectability of GW170817-like events
authors: Rosalba Perna, M. Celeste Artale, Yi-Han Wang, Michela Mapelli, Davide Lazzati, Cecilia Sgalletta, Filippo Santoliquido
topic: The detection of electromagnetic radiation (EM) accompanying the gravitational wave (GW) signal from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 has revealed that these systems constitute at least a fraction of the progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). As gravitational wave detectors keep pushing their detection horizons, it is important to assess coupled GW/EM probabilities, and how to maximize observational prospects. Here we perform population synthesis calculations of BNS evolution with the code MOBSE, and seed the binaries in galaxies at three representative redshifts (z=0.01,0.1,1) of the Illustris TNG50 simulation. The binaries are evolved and their locations numerically tracked in the host galactic potentials until merger. Adopting the astrophysical parameters of GRB170817A as a prototype, we numerically compute the broadband lightcurves of jets from BNS mergers, with the afterglow brightness depending on the local medium density at the merger sites. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the resulting EM population assuming either a random viewing angle with respect to the jet, or a jet aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary, which biases the viewing angle probability for GW-triggered events. We find that [70-80\%] of BNSs from z=0.01 should be detectable in gamma-rays. The afterglow detection probabilities of GW-triggered BNS mergers vary between [0.3-0.7\%], with higher values for jets aligned with the BNS angular momentum, and are comparable across the high and low-energy bands, unlike gamma-ray-triggered events (cosmological SGRBs) which are significantly brighter at higher energies. We further quantify observational biases with respect to host galaxy masses.

title: Searches for Modulated γ-Ray Precursors to Compact Binary Mergers in Fermi-GBM Data
authors: Cosmin Stachie, Tito Dal Canton, Nelson Christensen, Marie-Anne Bizouard, Michael Briggs, Eric Burns, Jordan Camp, Michael Coughlin
topic: GW170817 is the only gravitational-wave (GW) event, for which a confirmed {\gamma}-ray counterpart, GRB 170817A, has been detected. Here we present a method to search for another type of {\gamma}-ray signal, a {\gamma}-ray burst precursor, associated with a compact binary merger. If emitted shortly before the coalescence, a high-energy electromagnetic (EM) flash travels through a highly dynamical and relativistic environment, created by the two compact objects orbiting each other. Thus, the EM signal arriving at an Earth observer could present a somewhat predictable time-dependent modulation. We describe a targeted search method for lightcurves exhibiting such a modulation, parameterized by the observer-frame component masses and binary merger time, using Fermi-GBM data. The sensitivity of the method is assessed based on simulated signals added to GBM data. The method is then applied to a selection of potentially interesting compact binary mergers detected during the second (O2) and third (O3) observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We find no significant modulated {\gamma}-ray precursor signal associated with any of the considered events.

Cackett, Alice Harding
topic: The brightest Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs) are mysterious extragalactic explosions that may represent a new class of astrophysical phenomena. Their fast time to maximum brightness of less than a week and decline over several months and atypical optical spectra and evolution are difficult to explain within the context of core-collapse of massive stars which are powered by radioactive decay of Nickel-56 and evolve more slowly. AT2018cow (at redshift of 0.014) is an extreme FBOT in terms of rapid evolution and high luminosities. Here we present evidence for a high-amplitude quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) of AT2018cow's soft X-rays with a frequency of 224 Hz (at 3.7 significance level or false alarm probability of 0.02\%) and fractional root-mean-squared amplitude of 30\%. This signal is found in the average power density spectrum taken over the entire 60-day outburst and suggests a highly persistent signal that lasts for a billion cycles. The high frequency (rapid timescale) of 224 Hz (4.4 ms) argues for a compact object in AT2018cow, which can be a neutron star or black hole with a mass less than 850 solar masses. If the QPO is the spin period of a neutron star, we can set limits on the star's magnetic field strength. Our work highlights a new way of using high time-resolution X-ray observations to study FBOTs.

title: Long-term FRII jet evolution in dense environments
authors: Manel Perucho, José María Martí, Vicent Quilis
topic: We present long-term numerical three-dimensional simulations of a relativistic outflow propagating through a galactic ambient medium and environment, up to distances 100kpc. Our aim is to study the role of dense media in the global dynamics of the radio source. We use a relativistic gas equation of state, and a basic description of thermal cooling terms. In previous work, we showed that a linear perturbation could enhance the jet propagation during the early phases of evolution, by introducing obliquity to the jet reverse shock. Here, we show that this effect is reduced in denser media. We find that the dentist-drill effect acts earlier, due to slower jet propagation and an increased growth of the helical instability. The global morphology of the jet is less elongated, with more prominent lobes. The fundamental physical parameters of the jet generated structure derived from our simulations fall within the estimated values derived for FRII jets in the 3C sample. In agreement with previous axisymmetric and three dimensional simulations in lower density media, we conclude that shock heating of the interstellar and intergalactic media is very efficient in the case of powerful, relativistic jets.

title: Flares in gamma-ray burst X-ray afterglows as prompt emission from slightly misaligned structured jets
authors: Raphaël Duque, Paz Beniamini, Frédéric Daigne, Robert Mochkovitch
topic: We develop a model to explain the flaring activity in gamma-ray burst X-ray afterglows within the framework of slightly misaligned observers to structured jets. We suggest that flares could be the manifestation of prompt dissipation within the core of the jet, appearing to a misaligned observer in the X-ray band because of less favorable Doppler boosting. These flares appear during the afterglow phase because of core--observer light travel delays. In this picture, the prompt emission recorded by this observer comes from material along their line of sight, in the lateral structure of the jet, outside the jet's core. We start by laying down the basic analytical framework to determine the flares characteristics as a function of those of the gamma-ray pulse an aligned observer would have seen. We show that, for typical flare observing times and luminosities, there is indeed viable parameter space to explain flares in this way. We then analytically explore this model and show that it naturally produces flares with small width, a salient observed property of flares. We perform fits of our model to two Swift/XRT flares representing two different types of morphology, to show that our model can capture both. The ejection time of the core jet material responsible of the flare is a critical parameter. While it always remains small compared to the observed time of the flare, confirming that our model does not require very late central engine activity, late ejection times are strongly favored, sometimes larger than the observed duration of the parent gamma-ray burst's prompt phase as measured by T90.

title: Population Properties of Gravitational-Wave Neutron Star--Black Hole Mergers
authors: Jin-Ping Zhu, Shichao Wu, Ying Qin, Bing Zhang, He Gao, Zhoujian Cao
topic: Over the course of the third observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, several gravitational-wave (GW) neutron star--black hole (NSBH) candidates have been announced. By assuming these candidates are of astrophysical origins, we analyze the population properties of the mass and spin distributions for GW NSBH mergers. We find that the primary BH mass distribution of NSBH systems, whose shape is consistent with that inferred from the GW binary BH (BBH) primaries, can be well described as a power-law with an index of alpha=4.8+4.5-2.8 plus a high-mass Gaussian component peaking at 33+14-9Msum. The NS mass spectrum could be shaped as a near flat distribution between 1.0-2.1Msum. The constrained NS maximum mass agrees with that inferred from NSs in our Galaxy. If GW190814 and GW200210 are NSBH mergers, the posterior results of the NS maximum mass would be always larger than 2.5Musm and significantly deviate from that inferred in the Galactic NSs. The effective inspiral spin and effective precession spin of GW NSBH mergers are measured to potentially have near-zero distributions. The negligible spins for GW NSBH mergers imply that most events in the universe should be plunging events, which supports the standard isolated formation channel of NSBH binaries. More NSBH mergers to be discovered in the fourth observing run would help to more precisely model the population properties of cosmological NSBH mergers.

title: The physics of the MHD disk-jet transition in binary systems: jetted spiral walls launched from disk spiral arms
authors: Somayeh Sheikhnezami, Christian Fendt
topic: We present a detailed physical analysis of the jet launching mechanism of a circum-stellar disk that is located in a binary system. Applying 3D resistive MHD simulations, we investigate the local and global properties of the system, such as the angular momentum transport and the accretion and ejection mass fluxes. In comparison to previous works, for the first time, we have considered the full magnetic torque, the presence of an outflow, thus the angular momentum transport by vertical motion, and the binary torque. We discuss its specific 3D structure, and how it is affected by tidal effects. We find that the spiral structure evolving in the disk is {launched into the outflow}. We propose to call this newly discovered structure a {jet spiral wall}. These spiral features follow the same time evolution, with the jet spiral somewhat lagging the disk spiral. We find that the vertical transport of angular momentum has a significant role in the total angular momentum budget also in a binary system. The same holds for the magnetic torque, however, the contribution from the ϕ-derivative of magnetic pressure and the Bphi-Br stresses are small. The gravity torque arising from the time-dependent 3D Roche potential becomes essential, as it constitutes the fundamental cause for all 3D effects appearing in our disk-jet system. Quantitatively, we find that the disk accretion rate in a binary system increases by [20\%] compared to a disk around a single star. The disk wind mass flux increases by even 50.

title: Multi-Messenger Constraints on Magnetic Fields in Merging Black Hole-Neutron Star Binaries
authors: Daniel J. D'Orazio, Zoltan Haiman, Janna Levin, Johan Samsing, Alejandro Vigna-Gomez
topic: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently detected gravitational waves (GWs) from the merger of black-hole-neutron-star (BHNS) binary systems GW200105 and GW200115. No coincident electromagnetic (EM) counterparts were detected. While the mass ratio and BH spin in both systems were not sufficient to tidally disrupt the NS outside of the BH event horizon, other, magnetospheric mechanisms for EM emission exist in this regime and depend sensitively on the NS magnetic field strength. Combining GW measurements with EM flux upper limits, we place upper limits on the NS surface magnetic field strength above which magnetospheric emission models would have generated an observable EM counterpart. We consider fireball models powered by the black-hole battery mechanism, where energy is output in gamma-rays over 1-second. Consistency with no detection by Fermi-GBM or INTEGRAL SPI-ACS constrains the NS surface magnetic field to 1015-G. Hence, joint GW detection and EM upper limits rule out the theoretical possibility that the NSs in GW200105 and GW200115, and the putative NS in GW190814, retain 1015-G dipolar magnetic fields until merger. They also rule out formation scenarios where strongly magnetized magnetars quickly merge with BHs. We alternatively rule out operation of the BH-battery powered fireball mechanism in these systems. This is the first multi-messenger constraint on NS magnetic fields in BHNS systems and a novel approach to probe fields at this point in NS evolution. This demonstrates the constraining power that multi-messenger analyses of BHNS mergers have on BHNS formation scenarios, the magnetic-field evolution in NSs, and the physics of BHNS magnetospheric interactions.

title: Could TDE outflows produce the PeV neutrino events?
authors: Han-Ji Wu, Guo-Bin Mou, Kai Wang, Wei Wang, Zhuo Li 
topic: The origin of ultra-high energy neutrinos still lacks observational evidence, besides, the physical mechanism is also unclear. There is an association of a PeV neutrino event (IceCube-191001A) with an optical tidal disruption event (TDE, AT2019dsg) which was detected 6 months ahead from IceCube-191001A. The numerical simulations and observations suggested that a TDE can produce ultrafast outflows, which will interact with clouds near the supermassive black hole. In this paper, we study the interactions between TDE outflows and clouds and the possible production. In the shock waves generated by the outflow-cloud interactions, protons can be accelerated to 60 PeV with the outflow velocity 0.07 c and kinetic luminosity 1045erg/s. PeV neutrinos can be produced through hadronic reactions. The calculation illustrates that the expected PeV neutrino event from AT2019dsg is 0.014 for a power-law proton energy distribution of Gamma=1.5 and 0.0016 for Gamma=1.9. The GeV --TeV gamma-rays through hadronic processes are lower than the present observed limits. Outflows escaped from the TDE center colliding with clouds, which also can naturally explain the half-year delay between the neutrino event and TDE.

title: On the stability of isothermal shocks in black hole accretion disks
authors: Eric W. Hester, Geoffrey M. Vasil, Martin Wechselberger
topic: Most black holes possess accretion disks. Models of such disks inform observations and constrain the properties of the black holes and their surrounding medium. Here, we study isothermal shocks in a thin black hole accretion flow. Modelling infinitesimal molecular viscosity allows the use of multiple-scales matched asymptotic methods. We thus derive the first explicit calculations of isothermal shock stability. We find that the inner shock is always unstable, and the outer shock is always stable. The growth/decay rates of perturbations depend only on an effective potential and the incoming--outgoing flow difference at the shock location. We give a prescription of accretion regimes in terms of angular momentum and black hole radius. Accounting for angular momentum dissipation implies unstable outer shocks in much of parameter space, even for realistic viscous Reynolds numbers of the orde..

title: r-process Nucleosynthesis and Kilonovae from Hypermassive Neutron Star Remnants
authors: Sanjana Curtis, Philipp Mösta, Zhenyu Wu, David Radice, Luke Roberts, Giacomo Ricigliano, Albino Perego
topic: We investigate r-process nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission resulting from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers based on a three-dimensional (3D) general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant. The simulation includes a microphysical finite-temperature equation of state (EOS) and neutrino emission and absorption effects via a leakage scheme. We track the thermodynamic properties of the ejecta using Lagrangian tracer particles and determine its composition using the nuclear reaction network 𝚂𝚔𝚢𝙽𝚎𝚝. We investigate the impact of neutrinos on the nucleosynthetic yields by varying the neutrino luminosities during post-processing. The ejecta show a broad distribution with respect to their electron fraction Ye, peaking between 0.25-0.4 depending on the neutrino luminosity employed. We find that the resulting r-process abundance patterns differ from solar, with no significant production of material beyond the second r-process peak when using luminosities recorded by the tracer particles. We also map the HMNS outflows to the radiation hydrodynamics code 𝚂𝙽𝙴𝙲 and predict the evolution of the bolometric luminosity as well as broadband light curves of the kilonova. The bolometric light curve peaks on the timescale of a day and the brightest emission is seen in the infrared bands. This is the first direct calculation of the r-process yields and kilonova signal expected from HMNS winds based on 3D GRMHD simulations. For longer-lived remnants, these winds may be the dominant ejecta component producing the kilonova emission.

topic: We present AT2020mrf ([SRGe J154754.2+443907]), an extra-galactic (z=0.1353) fast-rising (tg,rise=3.7 days) luminous (Mg,peak=-20.0) optical transient. Its optical spectrum around peak shows a broad (v-0.1c) emission feature on a blue continuum (T-2×10to4 K), which bears a striking resemblance to AT2018cow. Its bright radio emission (nuLnu=1.2×1039ergs-1; nu rest=7.4 GHz; 261 days) is similar to four other AT2018cow-like events, and can be explained by synchrotron radiation from the interaction between a sub-relativistic (less or eq 0.07-0.08c) forward shock and a dense environment (M less eq 10-3 Msun yr-1 for vw=103kms-1). AT2020mrf occurs in a galaxy with Mass 10to8Mun and specific star formation rate 10-10yr-1, supporting the idea that AT2018cow-like events are preferentially hosted by dwarf galaxies. The X-ray properties of AT2020mrf are unprecedented. At 35--37 days, SRG/eROSITA detected luminous (LX-2x1043ergs-1; 0.3--10 keV) X-ray emission. The X-ray spectral shape (fnu porp nu-0.8) and erratic intraday variability are reminiscent of AT2018cow, but the luminosity is a factor of 20 greater than AT2018cow. At 328 days, Chandra detected it at LX-1042ergs-1, which is exceeds 200 times more luminous than AT2018cow and CSS161010. At the same time, the X-ray emission remains variable on the timescale of 1 day. We show that a central engine, probably a millisecond magnetar or an accreting black hole, is required to power the explosion. We predict the rates at which events like AT2018cow and AT2020mrf will be detected by present and future X-ray all-sky surveys, including SRG and Einstein Probe.

topic: The immense power of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) make them ideal probes of the early universe. By using absorption lines in the afterglows of high-redshift GRBs, astronomers can study the evolution of metals in the early universe. With an understanding of the nature of GRB progenitors, the rate and properties of GRBs observed at high redshift can probe the star formation history and the initial mass function of stars at high redshift. This paper presents a detailed study of the metallicity- and mass-dependence of the properties of long-duration GRBs under the black-hole accretion disk paradigm to predict the evolution of these properties with redshift. These models are calibrated on the current GRB observations and then used to make predictions for new observations and new missions (e.g. the proposed Gamow mission) studying high-redshift GRBs.

topic: Synchrotron processes, the radiative processes associated with the interaction of energetic charged particles with magnetic field, are of interest in many areas in astronomy, from the interstellar medium to extreme environments near compact objects. Consequently, observations of synchrotron sources carry information on the physical properties of the sources themselves and those of their close vicinity. In recent years, novel observations of such sources with multi-wavelength collaborations reveal complex features and peculiarities, especially near black holes. Exploring the nature of these sources in more detail necessitates numerical tools complementary to analytical one-zone modelling efforts. In this paper, we introduce an open-source Python package tailored to this purpose, flaremodel. The core of the code consists of low-level utility functions to describe physical processes relevant to synchrotron sources, which are written in C for performance and parallelised with OpenMP for scalability. The Python interface provides access to these functions and built-in source models are provided as a guidance. At the same time, the modular design of the code and the generic nature of these functions enable users to build a variety of source models applicable to many astrophysical synchrotron sources. We describe our methodology and the structure of our code along with selected examples demonstrating capabilities and options for future modelling efforts.

topic: We present optical and near-infrared photometric observations of GRB 191016 with the COATLI, DDOTI and RATIR ground-based telescopes over the first three nights. We present the temporal evolution of the optical afterglow and describe 5 different stages that were not completely characterized in previous works, mainly due to scarcity of data points to accurately fit the different components of the optical emission. After the end of the prompt gamma-ray emission, we observed the afterglow rise slowly in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths and peak at around T 1450s in all filters. This was followed by an early decay, a clear plateau from T 5000s to T 11000s, and then a regular late decay. We also present evidence of the jet break at later times, with a temporal index in good agreement with the temporal slope obtained from X-ray observations. Although many of the features observed in the optical light curves of GRBs are usually well explained by a reverse shock (RS) or forward shock(FS), the shallowness of the optical rise and enhanced peak emission in the GRB191016A afterglow is not well-fitted by only a FS or a RS. We propose a theoretical model which considers both of these components and combines an evolving FS with a later embedded RS and a subsequent late energy injection from the central engine activity. We use this model to successfully explain the temporal evolution of the light curves and discuss its implications on the fireball properties.

topic: GRB 190829A at z=0.0785 is the fourth closest long GRB ever detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory, and the third confirmed case with a very high energy component. We present our multi-wavelength analysis of this rare event, focusing on its early stages of evolution, and including data from Swift, the MASTER global network of optical telescopes, ALMA, and ATCA. We report sensitive limits on the linear polarization of the optical emission, disfavouring models of off-axis jets to explain the delayed afterglow peak. The study of the multi-wavelength light curves and broadband spectra supports a model with at least two emission components: a bright reverse shock emission, visible at early times in the optical and X-rays and, later, in the radio band; and a forward shock component dominating at later times and lower radio frequencies. A combined study of the prompt and afterglow properties shows many similarities with cosmological long GRBs, suggesting that GRB 190829A is an example of classical GRBs in the nearby universe.

title: A New Moment-Based General-Relativistic Neutrino-Radiation Transport Code: Methods and First Applications to Neutron Star Mergers
authors: David Radice, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Albino Perego, Roland Haas
topic: We present a new moment-based neutrino transport code for neutron star merger simulations in general relativity. In the merger context, ours is the first code to include Doppler effects at all orders in v/c, retaining all nonlinear neutrino-matter coupling terms. The code is validated with a stringent series of tests. We show that the inclusion of full neutrino-matter coupling terms is necessary to correctly capture the trapping of neutrinos in relativistically moving media, such as in differentially rotating merger remnants. We perform preliminary simulations proving the robustness of the scheme in simulating ab-initio mergers to black hole collapse and long-term neutron star remnants up to 70ms. The latter is the longest dynamical spacetime, 3D, general relativistic simulations with full neutrino transport to date. We compare results obtained at different resolutions and using two different closures for the moment scheme. We do not find evidences of significant out-of-thermodynamic equilibrium effects, such as bulk viscosity, on the postmerger dynamics or gravitational wave emission. Neutrino luminosities and average energies are in good agreement with theory expectations and previous simulations by other groups using similar schemes. We compare dynamical and early wind ejecta properties obtained with M1 and with our older neutrino treatment. We find that the M1 results have systematically larger proton fractions. However, the differences in the nucleosynthesis yields are modest. This work sets the basis for future detailed studies spanning a wider set of neutrino reactions, binaries and equations of state.

title: Current driven kink instabilities in relativistic jets: dissipation properties
authors: G. Bodo, G. Mamatsashvili, P. Rossi, A. Mignone
topic: We analyze the evolution of current driven kink instabilities of a highly magnetized relativistic plasma column, focusing in particular on its dissipation properties. The instability evolution leads to the formation of thin current sheets where the magnetic energy is dissipated. We find that the total amount of dissipated magnetic energy is independent of the dissipation properties. Dissipation occurs in two stages: a peak when the instability saturates, which is characterized by the formation of a helicoidal current sheet at the boundary of the deformed plasma column, followed by a weaker almost flat phase, in which turbulence develops. The detailed properties of these two phases depend on the equilibrium configuration and other parameters, in particular on the steepness of the pitch radial profile, on the presence of an external axial magnetic field and on the amount of magnetization. These results are relevant for high energy astrophysical sources, since current sheets can be the sites of magnetic reconnection where particles can be accelerated to relativistic energies and give rise to the observed radiation.

topic: Astrophysical shocks are very common and are interesting as they are responsible for particle acceleration in supernovas, blazers, and neutron stars. In this work, we study general relativistic shocks from the frame of the front. We derive the jump conditions and the Taub adiabat equation for both the space-like and time-like shocks. We solve these equations in a neutron star system where the shock is followed by a combustion front which is deconfining hadronic matter to quark matter. The maximum mass of the daughter quark star (generated from the combustion of the parent neutron star) is consistent with the maximum mass limit for the EoS sequence. We find that matter velocities for GR shocks under suitable conditions can break the speed of light limit indicating a very fast combustion process. Also, the matter velocities imply that for space-like shocks the combustion process is most probably a deflagration and for time-like shocks, it is a detonation and can even proceed with velocities that are super-luminous.

title: Early-time Searches for Coherent Radio Emission from Short GRBs with the Murchison Widefield Array

topic: Here we present a low frequency (170-200MHz) search for coherent radio emission associated with nine short GRBs detected by the Swift and/or Fermi satellites using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) rapid-response observing mode. The MWA began observing these events within 30 to 60s of their high-energy detection, enabling us to capture any dispersion delayed signals emitted by short GRBs for a typical range of redshifts. We conducted transient searches at the GRB positions on timescales of 5s, 30s and 2min, resulting in the most constraining flux density limits on any associated transient of 0.42, 0.29, and 0.084Jy, respectively. We also searched for dispersed signals at a temporal and spectral resolution of 0.5s and 1.28MHz but none were detected. However, the fluence limit of 80-100Jy ms derived for GRB 190627A is the most stringent to date for a short GRB. We compared the fluence and persistent emission limits to short GRB coherent emission models, placing constraints on key parameters including the radio emission efficiency of the nearly merged neutron stars (less 10-4), the fraction of magnetic energy in the GRB jet (less 2 times 10-4), and the radio emission efficiency of the magnetar remnant (less 103). Comparing the limits derived for our full GRB sample to the same emission models, we demonstrate that our 30-min flux density limits were sensitive enough to theoretically detect the persistent radio emission from magnetar remnants up to a redshift of z0.6. Our non-detection of this emission could imply that some GRBs in the sample were not genuinely short or did not result from a binary neutron star merger, the GRBs were at high redshifts, these mergers formed atypical magnetars, the radiation beams of the magnetar remnants were pointing away from Earth, or the majority did not form magnetars but rather collapse directly into black holes.

title: GRB prompt phase spectra under backscattering dominated model
authors: Mukesh Kumar Vyas, Asaf Pe'er, David Eichler
topic: We propose a backscattering dominated prompt emission model for gamma-ray bursts (GRB) prompt phase in which the photons generated through pair annihilation at the centre of the burst are backscattered through Compton scattering by an outflowing stellar cork. We show that the obtained spectra are capable of explaining the low and high energy slopes as well as the distribution of spectral peak energies in their observed prompt spectra.

title: Constraining the circumburst medium of gamma-ray bursts with X-ray afterglows
authors: Xiao Tian, Ying Qin, Mei Du, Shuang-Xi Yi, Yan-Ke Tang
topic: Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are considered to be originated from core collapse of massive stars. It is believed that the afterglow property is determined by the density of the material in the surrounding interstellar medium. Therefore, the circumburst density can be used to distinguish between an interstellar wind n(R)-R-k, and a constant density medium (ISM), n(R)=const. Previous studies with different afterglow samples, show that the circumburst medium of GRBs is neither simply supported by an interstellar wind, nor completely favored by an ISM. In this work, our new sample is consisted of 39 GRBs with smoothly onset bump-like features in early X-ray afterglows, in which 20 GRBs have the redshift measurements. By using a smooth broken power law function to fit the bumps of X-ray light curves, we derive the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) as the feature width (omega), as well as the rise and decay time scales of the bumps (Tr and Td). The correlations between the timescales of X-ray bumps are similar to those found previously in the optical afterglows. Based on the fireball forward shock (FS) model of the thin shell case, we obtain the distribution of the electron spectral index p, and further constrain the medium density distribution index k. The new inferred k is found to be concentrated at 1.0, with a range from 0.2 to 1.8. This finding is consistent with previous studies. The conclusion of our detailed investigation for X-ray afterglows suggests that the ambient medium of the selected GRBs is not homogeneous, i.e., neither ISM nor the typical interstellar wind.

title: Neutrino emission from binary neutron star mergers: characterizing light curves and mean energies
authors: Marco Cusinato, Federico Maria Guercilena, Albino Perego, Domenico Logoteta, David Radice, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Stefano Ansoldi
topic: Neutrinos are copiously emitted by neutron star mergers, due to the high temperatures reached by dense matter during the merger and its aftermath. Neutrinos influence the merger dynamics and shape the properties of the ejecta, including the resulting r-process nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission. In this work, we analyze neutrino emission from a large sample of merger radiation hydrodynamics simulations in Numerical Relativity, covering a broad range of initial masses, nuclear equation of state and viscosity treatments. We extract neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and compute quantities of interest such as the peak values, peak broadnesses, time averages and decrease time scales. We provide a systematic description of such quantities, including their dependence on the initial parameters of the system. We find that for equal-mass systems the total neutrino luminosity (several 1053erg s-1) decreases for increasing reduced tidal deformability, as a consequence of the less violent merger dynamics. Similarly, tidal disruption in asymmetric mergers leads to systematically smaller luminosities. Peak luminosities can be twice as large as the average ones. Electron antineutrino luminosities dominate (initially by a factor of 2-3) over electron neutrino ones, while electron neutrinos and heavy flavour neutrinos have similar luminosities. Mean energies are nearly constant in time and independent on the binary parameters. Their values reflect the different decoupling temperature inside the merger remnant. Despite present uncertainties in neutrino modelling, our results provide a broad and physically grounded characterization of neutrino emission, and they can serve as a reference point to develop more sophisticated neutrino transport schemes.

title: Chemical stratification in a long gamma-ray burst cocoon and early-time spectral signatures of supernovae associated with gamma-ray bursts
authors: Akihiro Suzuki, Keiichi Maeda
topic: We present the results of 3D hydrodynamic simulations of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet emanating from a massive star with a particular focus on the formation of high-velocity quasi-spherical ejecta and the jet-induced chemical mixing. Recent early-time optical observations of supernovae associated with GRBs (e.g., GRB 171205A/SN 2017iuk) indicate a considerable amount of heavy metals in the high-velocity outer layers of the ejecta. Using our jet simulations, we show that the density and chemical structure of the outer ejecta implied by observations can be naturally reproduced by a powerful jet penetrating the progenitor star. We consider three representative jet models with a stripped massive star, a standard jet, a weak jet, and a jet choked by an extended circumstellar medium, to clarify the differences in the dynamical evolution and the chemical properties of the ejected materials. The standard jet successfully penetrates the progenitor star and creates a quasi-spherical ejecta component (cocoon). The jet-induced mixing significantly contaminates the cocoon with heavy elements that have been otherwise embedded in the inner layer of the ejecta. The weak and choked jet models fail to produce an ultra-relativistic jet but produce a quasi-spherical cocoon with different chemical properties. We discuss the impact of the different jet-star interactions on the expected early-time electromagnetic signatures of long GRBs and how to probe the jet dynamics from observations.

title: Applying models of pulsar wind nebulae to explain X-ray plateaux following short gamma-ray bursts
authors: L. C. Strang, A Melatos
topic: Many short Gamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs) have a prolonged plateau in the X-ray afterglow lasting up to tens of thousands of seconds. A central engine injecting energy into the remnant may fuel the plateau. A simple analytic model describing the interaction of the magnetized relativistic wind from a rapidly-rotating magnetar with the surrounding environment can reproduce X-ray plateaux and instantaneous spectra. The model is analogous to classic, well-established models of young supernova remnants and applies the underlying physics to sGRB remnants. The light curve and spectra produced by the model are compared to observations of GRB 130603B. The spectra are also used to estimate parameters of the magnetar including its poloidal field strength and angular frequency. If combined with a gravitational wave signal, this model could provide insight into multimessenger astronomy and neutron star physics.

title: Relativistic X-ray Reflection Models for Accreting Neutron Stars
authors: Javier A. Garcia, Thomas Dauser, Renee Ludlam, Michael Parker, Andrew Fabian, Fiona A. Harrison, Joern Wilms
topic: We present new reflection models specifically tailored to model the X-ray radiation reprocessed in accretion disks around neutron stars, in which the primary continuum is characterized by a single temperature blackbody spectrum, emitted either at the surface of the star, or at the boundary layer. These models differ significantly from those with a standard power-law continuum, typically observed in most accreting black holes. We show comparisons with earlier reflection models, and test their performance in the NuSTAR observation of the neutron star 4U 1705-44. Simulations of upcoming missions such as XRISM-Resolve and Athena X-IFU are shown to highly the diagnostic potential of these models for high-resolution X-ray reflection spectroscopy. These new reflection models xillverNS, and their relativistic counterpart relxillNS, are made publicly available to the community as an additional flavor in the relxill suite of reflection models.

title: QHC21 equation of state of neutron star matter -- in light of 2021 NICER data
authors: Toru Kojo, Gordon Baym, Tetsuo Hatsuda
topic: The recent NICER measurement of the radius of the neutron star PSR J0740+6620, and the inferred small variation in neutron star radii from 1.4Ms to 2.1Ms, suggest that the neutron star equation of state remains relatively stiff up to baryon densities n 2-4 times nuclear saturation density, n0 -- the region where we expect hadronic matter to be undergoing transformation into quark matter. To delineate the physics from the nuclear to the quark matter regimes we use the quark-hadron-crossover (QHC) template to construct an updated equation of state, QHC21. We include nuclear matter results primarily based on chiral effective field theory, but also note results of using nuclear matter variational calculations based on empirical nuclear forces, thus covering the range of uncertainties in the nuclear equation of state. To allow for a possible early transition to quark degrees of freedom we begin the crossover regime from nucleons to quarks at 1.5n0. The resulting equations of state are stiffer than our earlier QHC19 at 2n0, predicting larger radii in substantial agreement with the NICER data, with accompanying peaks in sound velocity at 2-4n0. We discuss possible microscopic mechanisms underlying stiffening of the equation of state.

title: Magnetospheric curvature radiation by bunches as emission mechanism for repeating fast radio bursts
authors: Wei-Yang Wang, Yuan-Pei Yang, Chen-Hui Niu, Renxin Xu, Bing Zhang
topic: Coherent curvature radiation as the radiation mechanism for fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been discussed since FRBs were discovered. We study the spectral and polarization properties of repeating FRBs within the framework of coherent curvature radiation by charged bunches in the magnetosphere of a highly magnetized neutron star. The spectra can be generally characterized by multisegment broken power laws, and evolve as bunches move and the line of sight sweeps. Emitted waves are highly linear polarized if the line of sight is confined to the beam within an angle of 1/Gamma, while circular polarized degree becomes strong for off-beam cases. The spectro-temporal pulse-to-pulse properties can be a natural consequence due to the magnetospheric geometry. We investigate the relationship between drift rate, central frequency and their temporal duration. The radius-to-frequency mapping is derived and simulated within the assumptions of both dipolar and quadrupolar magnetic configurations. The geometric results show that FRBs are emitted in field lines more curved than open field lines for a dipolar geometry. This suggests that there are most likely existing multipolar magnetic configurations in the emission region.

title: A Shock-in-Jet Synchrotron Mirror Model for Blazars
authors: Markus Boettcher 
topic: Reinhard Schlickeiser has made groundbreaking contributions to various aspects of blazar physics, including diffusive shock acceleration, the theory of synchrotron radiation, the production of gamma-rays through Compton scattering in various astrophysical sources, etc. This paper, describing the development of a self-consistent shock-in-jet model for blazars with a synchrotron mirror feature, is therefore an appropriate contribution to a Special Issue in honor of Reinhard Schlickeiser's 70th birthday. The model is based on our previous development of a self-consistent shock-in-jet model with relativistic thermal and non-thermal particle distributions evaluated via Monte-Carlo simulations of diffusive shock acceleration, and time-dependent radiative transport. This model has been very successful in modeling spectral variability patterns of several blazars, but has difficulties describing orphan flares, i.e., high-energy flares without a significant counterpart in the low-frequency (synchrotron) radiation component. As a solution, this paper investigates the possibility of a synchrotron mirror component within the shock-in-jet model. It is demonstrated that orphan flares result naturally in this scenario. The model's applicability to a recently observed orphan gamma-ray flare in the blazar 3C279 is discussed and it is found that only orphan flares with mild (a factor of 2-3) enhancements of the Compton dominance can be reproduced in a synchrotron-mirror scenario, if no additional parameter changes are invoked.

title: Metallicity-Suppressed Collapsars Cannot be the Dominant r-Process Source in the Milky Way
authors: Jack Fraser, Ralph Schönrich
topic: We develop a high-performance analytical model of Galactic Chemical Evolution, which accounts for delay time distributions and lock-up of stellar yields in a thermal-phased ISM. The model is capable of searching, for the first time, through the high-dimensional parameter space associated with the r-process enrichment of the Milky Way by its possible sources: Neutron Star Mergers and Collapsar events. Their differing formation mechanisms give these two processes different time dependencies, a property which has frequently been used to argue in favour of collapsars as the dominant r-process source. However, we show that even with large degrees of freedom in the allowed thermal, structural, and chemical properties of the galaxy, large regions of parameter space are in strong tension with the data. In particular, whilst we are able to find models in which neutron star mergers produce the majority of r-process material, the data rule out all models with dominant collapsar yields. With no other identified source, we conclude that Neutron Star Mergers must be the dominant contributors to the modern Milky Way r-process budget.

title: Model-independently calibrating the luminosity correlations of gamma-ray bursts using deep learning
authors: Li Tang, Xin Li, Hai-Nan Lin, Liang Liu
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected at high redshift can be used to trace the Hubble diagram of the Universe. However, the distance calibration of GRBs is not as easily as that of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). For the calibrating method based on the empirical luminosity correlations, there is an underlying assumption that the correlations should be universal over the whole redshift range. In this paper, we investigate the possible redshift dependence of six luminosity correlations with a completely model-independent deep learning method. We construct a network combining the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and the Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN), where RNN is used to reconstruct the distance-redshift relation by training the network with the Pantheon compilation, and BNN is used to calculate the uncertainty of the reconstruction. Using the reconstructed distance-redshift relation of Pantheon, we test the redshift dependence of six luminosity correlations by dividing the full GRB sample into two subsamples (low-z and high-z subsamples), and find that only the Ep-Egamma relation has no evidence for redshift dependence. We use the Ep-Egamma relation to calibrate GRBs, and the calibrated GRBs give tight constraint on the flat LambdaCDM model, with the best-fitting parameter [OmegaM=0.307+0.065-0.073].

authors: Damiano Caprioli, Colby Haggerty, Pasquale Blasi
topic: The recent discoveries in the theory of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) that stem from first-principle kinetic plasma simulations are discussed. When ion acceleration is efficient, the back-reaction of non-thermal particles and self-generated magnetic fields becomes prominent and leads to both enhanced shock compression and particle spectra significantly softer than those predicted by the standard test-particle DSA theory. These results are discussed in the context of the non-thermal phenomenology of astrophysical shocks, with a special focus on the remnant of SN1006.

title: Accounting for Selection Bias and Redshift Evolution in GRB Radio Afterglow Data
authors: Maria Dainotti, Delina Levine, Nissim Fraija, Poonam Chandra
topic: Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are highly energetic events that can be observed at extremely high redshift. However, inherent bias in GRB data due to selection effects and redshift evolution can significantly skew any subsequent analysis. We correct for important variables related to the GRB emission, such as the burst duration, T90, the prompt isotropic energy, Eiso, the rest-frame end time of the plateau emission, Ta,radio, and its correspondent luminosity La,radio, for radio afterglow. In particular, we use the Efron-Petrosian method presented in 1992 for the correction of our variables of interest. Specifically, we correct Eiso and T90 for 80 GRBs, and La,radio and Ta,radio for a subsample of 18 GRBs that present a plateau-like flattening in their light curve. Upon application of this method, we find strong evolution with redshift in most variables, particularly in La,radio, with values similar to those found in past and current literature in radio, X-ray and optical wavelengths, indicating that these variables are susceptible to observational bias. This analysis emphasizes the necessity of correcting observational data for evolutionary effects to obtain the intrinsic behavior of correlations to use them as discriminators among the most plausible theoretical models and as reliable cosmological tools.

title: A comparison of approximate non-linear Riemann solvers for Relativistic MHD
authors: Gincarlo Mattia, Andrea Mignone
topic: We compare a particular selection of approximate solutions of the Riemann problem in the context of ideal relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. In particular, we focus on Riemann solvers not requiring a full eigenvector structure. Such solvers recover the solution of the Riemann problem by solving a simplified or reduced set of jump conditions, whose level of complexity depends on the intermediate modes that are included. Five different approaches - namely the HLL, HLLC, HLLD, HLLEM and GFORCE schemes - are compared in terms of accuracy and robustness against one- and multi-dimensional standard numerical benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that - for weak or moderate magnetizations - the HLLD Riemann solver yields the most accurate results, followed by HLLC solver(s). The GFORCE approach provides a valid alternative to the HLL solver being less dissipative and equally robust for strongly magnetized environments. Finally, our tests show that the HLLEM Riemann solver is not cost-effective in improving the accuracy of the solution and reducing the numerical dissipation.

title: Understanding binary neutron star collisions with hypermodels
authors: Gregory Ashton, Tim Dietrich
topic: Gravitational waves from the collision of binary neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study the behaviour of supranuclear matter, the fundamental properties of gravity, and the cosmic history of our Universe. However, given the complexity of Einstein's Field Equations, theoretical models that enable source-property inference suffer from systematic uncertainties due to simplifying assumptions. We develop a hypermodel approach to compare and measure the uncertainty gravitational-wave approximants. Using state-of-the-art models, we apply this new technique to the binary neutron star observations GW170817 and GW190425 and the sub-threshold candidate [GW200311 103121]. Our analysis reveals subtle systematic differences between waveform models, and a frequency-dependence study suggests that this is due to the treatment of the tidal sector. This new technique provides a proving ground for model development, and a means to identify waveform-systematics in future observing runs where detector improvements will increase the number and clarity of binary neutron star collisions we observe.

title: Relativistic oblique shocks with ordered or random magnetic fields: tangential field governs
authors: Jing-Ze Ma, Bing Zhang
topic: Relativistic magnetohydrodynamic shocks are efficient particle accelerators, often invoked in the models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and shock-powered fast radio bursts (FRBs). Most theoretical studies assume a perpendicular shock with an ordered magnetic field perpendicular to the shock normal. However, the degree of magnetization sigma and the magnetic field geometry in shock-powered GRB/FRB scenarios are still poorly constrained by observations. Analogous to the magnetization sigma associated with the total field strength, we define a tangential magnetization σ⊥ associated with the tangential field component. We explore the jump conditions of magnetized relativistic shocks, either with an ordered field of arbitrary inclination angle or with a random field of arbitrary anisotropy. In either case, we find that the jump conditions of relativistic shocks are governed by the tangential magnetization sigma_T instead of the total magnetization σ, insensitive to the inclination angles or the anisotropy of the pre-shock magnetic field. The approximated analytical solution developed in this work could serve as a quick check for numerical simulations and apply to theoretical studies of GRBs/FRBs with a more general field geometry

topic: Long gamma-ray burst GRB 191016A was a bright and slow rising burst that was detected by the \textit{Swift} satellite and followed up by ground based Liverpool Telescope (LT). LT follow-up started 2411-s after the \textit{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) trigger using imager IO:O around the time of the late optical peak. From 3987-7687-s, we used the LT polarimeter RINGO3 to make polarimetric and photometric observations of the GRB simultaneously in the V,R and I bands. The combined optical light curve shows an initial late peak followed by a decline until 6147-s, 6087-s, and 5247-s for I,R and V filters respectively followed by a flattening phase. There is evidence of polarization at all phases including polarization (P=14.6+-7.2\%) which is coincident with the start of the flattening phase. The combination of the light curve morphology and polarization measurement favours an energy injection scenario where slower magnetised ejecta from the central engine catches up with the decelerating blast wave. We calculate the minimum energy injection to be [DeltaE/E \g 0.36]. At a later time combining the optical light curve from BOOTES (reported via GCN) and IO:O we see evidence of a jet break with jet opening angle 2 \degree.

title: Hydrodynamical transport of angular momentum in accretion disks in the presence of nonlinear perturbations due to noise
authors: Subham Ghosh, Banibrata Mukhopadhyay
topic: The origin of hydrodynamical instability and turbulence in the Keplerian accretion disk is a long-standing puzzle. The flow therein is linearly stable. Here we explore the evolution of perturbation in this flow in the presence of an additional force. Such a force, which is expected to be stochastic in nature hence behaving as noise, could result from thermal fluctuations (however small be), grain-fluid interactions, feedback from outflows in astrophysical disks, etc. We essentially establish the evolution of nonlinear perturbation in the presence of Coriolis and external forces, which is the modified Landau equation. We obtain that even in the linear regime, under suitable forcing and Reynolds number, the otherwise least stable perturbation evolves to a very large saturated amplitude, leading to nonlinearity and plausible turbulence. Hence, forcing essentially leads a linear stable mode to unstable. We further show that nonlinear perturbation diverges at a shorter time-scale in the presence of force, leading to a fast transition to turbulence. Interestingly, the emergence of nonlinearity depends only on the force but not on the initial amplitude of perturbation, unlike the original Landau equation-based solution.

title: Analytic model of the spectral properties of gravitational waves from neutron star merger remnants
authors: Theodoros Soultanis, Andreas Bauswein, Nikolaos Stergioulas
topic: We present a new analytic model describing gravitational wave emission in the post-merger phase of binary neutron star mergers. The model is described by a number of physical parameters that are related to various oscillation modes, quasi-linear combination tones or non-linear features that appear in the post-merger phase. The time evolution of the main post-merger frequency peak is taken into account and it is described by a two-segment linear expression. The effectiveness of the model, in terms of the fitting factor or, equivalently, the reduction in the detection rate, is evaluated along a sequence of equal-mass simulations of varying mass. We find that all parameters of the analytic model correlate with the total binary mass of the system. For high masses, we identify new spectral features originating from the non-linear coupling between the quasi-radial oscillation and the antipodal tidal deformation, the inclusion of which significantly improves the fitting factors achieved by the model. We can thus model the post-merger gravitational-wave emission with an analytic model that achieves high fitting factors for a wide range of total binary masses. Our model can be used for the detection and parameter estimation of the post-merger phase in upcoming searches with upgraded second-generation detectors, such as aLIGO+ and aVirgo+, with future, third-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer) or with dedicated, high-frequency detectors.

The simulations show dynamic formation of large scale intermittent long-lived current sheets being disrupted by the tearing instability into plasmoid chains. These current sheets are locations of enhanced magnetic field dissipation and heating of the plasma. We find magnetic energy spectra k-3/2, together with strongly pronounced dynamic alignment of Elsasser fields and of velocity and magnetic fields, for strong guide-field turbulence, whereas we retrieve spectra k-5/3 for the case of a weak guide-field.

authors: Zhenyu Wu, Giacomo Ricigliano, Rahul Kashyap, Albino Perego, David Radice
topic: We develop a method to compute synthetic kilonova light curves that combines numerical relativity simulations of neutron star mergers and the \texttt{SNEC} radiation-hydrodynamics code. We describe our implementation of initial and boundary conditions, r-process heating, and opacities for kilonova simulations. We validate our approach by carefully checking that energy conservation is satisfied and by comparing the \texttt{SNEC} results with those of two semi-analytic light curve models. We apply our code to the calculation of color light curves for three binaries having different mass ratios (equal and unequal mass) and different merger outcome (short-lived and long-lived remnants). We study the sensitivity of our results to hydrodynamic effects, nuclear physics uncertainties in the heating rates, and duration of the merger simulations. We also study the impact of shocks possibly launched into the outflows by a relativistic jet. None of our models match AT2017gfo, the kilonova in GW170817. This points to possible deficiencies in the merger simulations and to the need to go beyond the assumption of spherical symmetry adopted in this work.

In the case of dark standard sirens, a unique host galaxy is not identified, and the redshift information comes from the distribution of potential host galaxies. From the third LIGO/Virgo observing run detections, we add the asymmetric-mass binary black hole GW190412, the high-confidence GW candidates S191204r, S200129m, and S200311bg to the sample of dark standard sirens analyzed. Our sample contains the top 20\% (based on localization) GW events and candidates to date with significant coverage by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Survey. We combine the H0 posterior for eight dark siren events, finding H0=79.8+19.1-12.8 km s-1 Mpc-1 (68\% Highest Density Interval) for a prior in H0 uniform between [20,140] km s-1 Mpc-1. This result shows that a combination of 8 well-localized dark sirens combined with an appropriate galaxy catalog is able to provide an H0 constraint that is competitive (20\% versus 18\% precision) with a single bright standard siren analysis (i.e. assuming the electromagnetic counterpart) using GW170817. When combining the posterior with that from GW170817, we obtain H0=72.77+11.0-7.55 km s-1 Mpc-1. This result is broadly consistent with recent H0 estimates from both the Cosmic Microwave Background and Supernovae.

title: Particle Acceleration by Pickup Process Upstream of Relativistic Shocks
authors: Masanori Iwamoto, Takanobu Amano, Yosuke Matsumoto, Shuichi Matsukiyo, Masahiro Hoshino
topic: Particle acceleration at magnetized purely perpendicular relativistic shocks in electron-ion plasmas are studied by means of two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Magnetized shocks with the upstream bulk Lorentz factor [gamma1>1] are known to emit intense electromagnetic waves from the shock front, which induce electrostatic plasma waves (wakefield) and transverse filamentary structures in the upstream region via the stimulated/induced Raman scattering and the filamentation instability, respectively. The wakefield and filaments inject a fraction of incoming particles into a particle acceleration process, in which particles are once decoupled from the upstream bulk flow by the wakefield, and are piked up again by the flow. The picked-up particles are accelerated by the motional electric field. The maximum attainable Lorentz factor is estimated as [gamma-max] for electrons and [xxx] for ions, where alpha-10 is determined from our simulation results. alpha can increase up to gamma-1 for weakly magnetized shock if gama-1 is sufficiently large. This result indicates that highly relativistic astrophysical shocks such as external shocks of gamma-ray bursts can be an efficient particle accelerator.

title: How perturbative QCD constrains the Equation of State at Neutron-Star densities
authors: Oleg Komoltsev, Aleksi Kurkela
topic: We demonstrate in a general and analytic way how high-density information about the equation of state (EoS) of strongly interacting matter obtained using perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) constrains the same EoS at densities reachable in physical neutron stars. Our approach is based on utilizing the full information of the thermodynamic potentials at the high-density limit together with thermodynamic stability and causality. The results can be used to propagate the pQCD calculations reliable around 40ns to lower densities in the most conservative way possible. We constrain the EoS starting from only few times the nuclear saturation density [n>2.2ns] and at n=5ns we exclude at least 65\% of otherwise allowed area in the eps-p-plane. These purely theoretical results are independent of astrophysical neutron-star input and hence they can also be used to test theories of modified gravity and BSM physics in neutron stars.

title: Modeling general-relativistic plasmas with collisionless moments and dissipative two-fluid magnetohydrodynamics
authors: Elias R. Most, Jorge Noronha, Alexander A. Philippov
topic: Relativistic plasmas are central to the study of black hole accretion, jet physics, neutron star mergers, and compact object magnetospheres. Despite the need to accurately capture the dynamics of these plasmas and the implications for relativistic transients, their fluid modeling is typically done using a number of (overly) simplifying assumptions, which do not hold in general. This is especially true when the mean free path in the plasma is large compared to the system size, and kinetic effects start to become important. Going beyond common approaches used in the literature, we describe a fully relativistic covariant 14-moment based two-fluid system appropriate for the study of electron-ion or electron-positron plasmas. This generalized Israel-Stewart-like system of equations of motion is obtained directly from the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation. Crucially, this new formulation can account for non-ideal effects, such as anisotropic pressures and heat fluxes. We show that a relativistic two-fluid plasma can be recast as a single fluid coupled to electromagnetic fields with (potentially large) out-of-equilibrium corrections. In particular, we keep all electron degrees of freedom, which provide self-consistent evolution equations for electron temperature and momentum. The equations outlined in this paper are able to capture the full two-fluid character of collisionless plasmas found in black hole accretion and flaring processes around compact objects, as well Braginskii-like two-fluid magnetohydrodynamics applicable to weakly collisional plasmas inside accretion disks. This new formulation will be instrumental in the construction of a large class of next-generation simulations of relativistic transient phenomena produced around black holes and neutron stars.

title: Astrophysical Jets in Relativistic Regime : Thermal and Radiative Driving
authors: Mukesh Kumar Vyas
topic: We study the efficiency of radiation in driving jets around black holes. Including general relativity for the radiation driving, we also show that the radiation field is affected by strong gravitational field in non linear manner, making general relativistic analysis more significant. We obtained internal shocks in jets close to the base, as a result of non-conical cross section and nature of radiation field on jet dynamics. Theoretical evidence of internal shocks is significant, as these are required to explain high energy tail of the spectra of radio sources. Under thermal and radiative driving, jets with electron-positron composition are obtained to be achieving relativistic speeds up to Lorentz factors Gamma-10 while for electron-proton composition it is Gamma-2 for luminous discs. We also showed that extragalactic jets around AGNs are faster than those around microquasars. We obtain that through Compton scattering, relativistic jets generated with non relativistic temperatures, are efficiently heated by temperatures up to T-1011-12K. Further, we obtained transonic solutions with relativistic terminal speeds, for bound state of the jet at the base (that is, generalized Bernoulli parameter [E<1]), where gravity is dominant over thermal driving. In Thomson scattering regime no transonic solutions could be obtained. This shows that radiation, in fact, has greater role as it not only accelerates the unbound matter of the jets, but the acceleration is effective even in absence of any other accelerating agent such as thermal acceleration. A detailed analysis of dependence of jet variables upon various parameters like plasma composition, magnetic pressure in the disc, luminosity, accretion rate, jet geometry and jet launching energy etc, is carried out.

title: Turbulence and particle acceleration in a relativistic plasma
authors: Cristian Vega, Stanislav Boldyrev, Vadim Roytershteyn, Mikhail Medvedev
topic: In a collisionless plasma, the energy distribution function of plasma particles can be strongly affected by turbulence, in particular, it can develop a non-thermal power-law tail at large energies. We argue that turbulence with initially relativistically strong magnetic perturbations (magnetization parameter sigma>1) quickly evolves into a state with ultra-relativistic plasma temperature but mildly relativistic turbulent fluctuations. We present a phenomenological and numerical study suggesting that in this case, the exponent alpha in the power-law particle energy distribution function, [f(gamma \proptro gamma^alpha], depends on magnetic compressibility of turbulence. Our analytic prediction for the scaling exponent 'alpha' is in good agreement with the numerical results.

topic: We determine the threshold mass for prompt (no bounce) black hole formation in equal-mass neutron star (NS) mergers using a new set of 227 numerical relativity simulations. We consider 23 phenomenological and microphysical finite temperature equations of state (EOS), including models with hyperons and first-order phase transitions to deconfined quarks. We confirm the existence of EOS-insensitive relations between the threshold mass, the binary tidal parameter at the threshold (Lambda-th), the maximum mass of nonrotating NSs, and the radii of reference mass NSs. We correct the systematic errors in previously reported fitting coefficients that were obtained with approximate general-relativity simulations. We combine the EOS-insensitive relations, phenomenological constraints on NS properties and observational data from GW170817 to derive an improved lower limit on radii of maximum mass and 1.6 Msun NS of 9.81 km and 10.90 km, respectively. We also constrain the radius and quadrupolar tidal deformability (Lambda) of a 1.4 Msun NS to be larger than 10.74 km and 172, respectively. We consider uncertainties in all independent parameters -- fitting coefficients as well as GW170817 masses while reporting the range of radii constraints. We introduce new methods to constrain the upper as well as lower limit of NS maximum mass using future BNS detections and their identification as prompt or delayed collapse. With future observations it will be possible to derive even tighter constraints on the properties of matter at and above nuclear density using the method proposed in this work.

title: Shock acceleration with oblique and turbulent magnetic fields
authors: Siyao Xu, Alex Lazarian
topic: We investigate shock acceleration in a realistic astrophysical environment with density inhomogeneities. The turbulence induced by the interaction of the shock precursor with upstream density fluctuations amplifies both upstream and downstream magnetic fields via the turbulent dynamo. The dynamo-amplified turbulent magnetic fields (a) introduce variations of shock obliquities along the shock face, (b) enable energy gain through a combination of shock drift and diffusive processes, (c) give rise to various spectral indices of accelerated particles, (d) regulate the diffusion of particles both parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, and (e) increase the shock acceleration efficiency. Our results demonstrate that upstream density inhomogeneities and dynamo amplification of magnetic fields play an important role in shock acceleration, and thus shock acceleration depends on the condition of the ambient interstellar environment. The implications on understanding radio spectra of supernova remnants are also discussed.

title: General-relativistic neutrino-radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulation of black hole-neutron star mergers for seconds
authors: Kota Hayashi, Sho Fujibayashi, Kenta Kiuchi, Koutarou Kyutoku, Yuichiro Sekiguchi, Masaru Shibata
topic: Seconds-long numerical-relativity simulations for black hole-neutron star mergers are performed for the first time to obtain a self-consistent picture of the merger and post-merger evolution processes. To investigate the case that tidal disruption takes place, we choose the initial mass of the black hole to be 5.4Msun or 8.1Msun with the dimensionless spin of 0.75. The neutron-star mass is fixed to be 1.35Msun. We find that after the tidal disruption, dynamical mass ejection takes place spending 10ms together with the formation of a massive accretion disk. Subsequently, the magnetic field in the disk is amplified by the magnetic winding and magnetorotational instability, establishing a turbulent state and inducing the angular momentum transport. The post-merger mass ejection by the magnetically-induced viscous effect sets in at 300-500ms after the tidal disruption, at which the neutrino luminosity drops below 1051.5erg/s, and continues for several hundreds ms. A magnetosphere near the rotational axis of the black hole is developed after the matter and magnetic flux fall into the black hole from the accretion disk, and high-intensity Poynting flux generation sets in at a few hundreds ms after the tidal disruption. The intensity of the Poynting flux becomes low after the significant post-merger mass ejection, because the opening angle of the magnetosphere increases. The lifetime for the stage with the strong Poynting flux is 1-2s, which agrees with the typical duration of short-hard gamma-ray bursts.

title: Resonant Shattering Flares in Black Hole-Neutron Star and Binary Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Duncan Neill, David Tsang, Hendrik van Eerten, Geoffrey Ryan, William G. Newton
topic: Multi-messenger probes of BHNS and NSNS mergers are important for our understanding of the properties of these compact objects and the extreme physical domain they inhabit. While SGRBs and kilonovae are the most considered counterpart to these mergers, both require disruption of the NS, which may not occur in BHNS systems. We investigate the properties of an EM counterpart that does not require tidal disruption: resonant shattering flares (RSFs).
We find that RSFs are short (duration 0.1 s) non-thermal flares with luminosities up to a few x1048 erg/s that are strongly dependent on the magnetic field strength at the surface of the NS. These flares are a result of multiple colliding relativistic shells launched during the resonance window, leading to a prompt non-thermal gamma-ray emission, as well as broad-band afterglow emission.
We compute the expected rates of detectable RSFs using the BPASS population synthesis code, with different assumptions about the evolution of surface magnetic field strengths before merger. We find the rate of detectable RSFs to be 0.0001-5 per year for BHNS mergers and 0.0005-25 per year for NSNS mergers, with the lower bound corresponding to surface field decay consistent with magneto-thermal evolution in purely crustal fields, while the upper bounds are for systems which have longer-lived surface magnetic fields supported by flux frozen into the core. If some of the observed SGRB precursor flares are indeed RSFs, this suggests the presence of a longer-lived surface field for some fraction of the neutron star population, and that we should expect RSFs to be the most common detectable EM counterpart to GW detections of BHNS mergers. The non-detection of a RSF prior to GRB170817A provides an upper bound for the magnetic fields for the progenitor NSs of Bsurf 1013G.

title: "Super-Kilonovae" from Massive Collapsars as Signatures of Black-Hole Birth in the Pair-instability Mass Gap
authors: Daniel M. Siegel, Aman Agarwal, Jennifer Barnes, Brian D. Metzger, Mathieu Renzo, V. Ashley Villar
topic: The core collapse of rapidly rotating massive 10 Msun stars ("collapsars"), and resulting formation of hyper-accreting black holes, are a leading model for the central engines of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and promising sources of r-process nucleosynthesis. Here, we explore the signatures of collapsars from progenitors with extremely massive helium cores 130 Msun above the pair-instability mass gap. While rapid collapse to a black hole likely precludes a prompt explosion in these systems, we demonstrate that disk outflows can generate a large quantity (up to 50 Msun) of ejecta, comprised of 5-10 Msun in r-process elements and 0.1-1 Msun of 56Ni, expanding at velocities 0.1c. Radioactive heating of the disk-wind ejecta powers an optical/infrared transient, with a characteristic luminosity 1042 erg s−1 and spectral peak in the near-infrared (due to the high optical/UV opacities of lanthanide elements) similar to kilonovae from neutron star mergers, but with longer durations 1 month. These "super-kilonovae" (superKNe) herald the birth of massive black holes 60 Msun, which, as a result of disk wind mass-loss, can populate the pair-instability mass gap from above and could potentially create the binary components of GW190521. SuperKNe could be discovered via wide-field surveys such as those planned with the Roman Space Telescope or via late-time infrared follow-up observations of extremely energetic GRBs. Gravitational waves of frequency 0.1-50 Hz from non-axisymmetric instabilities in self-gravitating massive collapsar disks are potentially detectable by proposed third-generation intermediate and high-frequency observatories at distances up to hundreds of Mpc; in contrast to the "chirp" from binary mergers, the collapsar gravitational-wave signal decreases in frequency as the disk radius grows ("sad trombone").

title: Boundary Layers of Accretion Disks: Wave-Driven Transport and Disk Evolution
authors: Matthew S. B. Coleman, Roman R. Rafikov, Alexander A. Philippov
topic: Astrophysical objects possessing a material surface (white dwarfs, neutron stars, etc.) accrete gas from the disk through the so-called surface boundary layer (BL), in which the angular velocity of the accreting gas experiences a sharp drop. Acoustic waves excited by the supersonic shear in the BL play an important role in mediating the angular momentum and mass transport through that region. Here we examine the characteristics of the angular momentum transport produced by the different types of wave modes emerging in the inner disk, using the results of a large suite of hydrodynamic simulations of the BLs. We provide a comparative analysis of the transport properties of different modes across the range of relevant disk parameters. In particular, we identify the types of modes which are responsible for the mass accretion onto the central object. We find the correlated perturbations of surface density and radial velocity to provide an important contribution to the mass accretion rate. Although the wave-driven transport is intrinsically non-local, we do observe a clear correlation between the angular momentum flux injected into the disk by the waves and the mass accretion rate through the BL. We find the efficiency of angular momentum transport (normalized by thermal pressure) to be a weak function of the flow Mach number. We also quantify the wave-driven evolution of the inner disk, in particular the modification of the angular frequency profile in the disk. Our results pave the way for understanding wave-mediated transport in future three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic studies of the BLs.

topic: We search for gravitational-wave signals associated with gamma-ray bursts detected by the Fermi and Swift satellites during the second half of the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo (1 November 2019 15:00 UTC-27 March 2020 17:00 UTC). We conduct two independent searches: a generic gravitational-wave transients search to analyze 86 gamma-ray bursts and an analysis to target binary mergers with at least one neutron star as short gamma-ray burst progenitors for 17 events. We find no significant evidence for gravitational-wave signals associated with any of these gamma-ray bursts. A weighted binomial test of the combined results finds no evidence for sub-threshold gravitational wave signals associated with this GRB ensemble either. We use several source types and signal morphologies during the searches, resulting in lower bounds on the estimated distance to each gamma-ray burst. Finally, we constrain the population of low luminosity short gamma-ray bursts using results from the first to the third observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. The resulting population is in accordance with the local binary neutron star merger rate.

title: What really makes an accretion disc MAD
authors: Mitchell C. Begelman, Nicolas Scepi, Jason Dexter
topic: Magnetically arrested accretion discs (MADs) around black holes (BH) have the potential to stimulate the production of powerful jets and account for recent ultra-high-resolution observations of BH environments. Their main properties are usually attributed to the accumulation of dynamically significant net magnetic (vertical) flux throughout the arrested region, which is then regulated by interchange instabilities. Here we propose instead that it is mainly a dynamically important toroidal field -- the result of dynamo action triggered by the significant but still relatively weak vertical field -- that defines and regulates the properties of MADs. We suggest that rapid convection-like instabilities, involving interchange of toroidal flux tubes and operating concurrently with the magnetorotatonal instability (MRI), can regulate the structure of the disc and the escape of net flux. We generalize the convective stability criteria and disc structure equations to include the effects of a strong toroidal field and show that convective flows could be driven towards two distinct marginally stable states, one of which we associate with MADs. We confirm the plausibility of our theoretical model by comparing its quantitative predictions to simulations of both MAD and SANE (strongly magnetized but not "arrested") discs, and suggest a set of criteria that could help to distinguish MADs from other accretion states. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, we argue that MRI is not suppressed in MADs and is probably responsible for the existence of the strong toroidal field.

title: MRI-driven alpha-Omega dynamos in protoneutron stars
authors: Alexis Reboul-Salze, Jérôme Guilet, Raphaël Raynaud, Matteo Bugli
topic: Magnetars are highly magnetized neutron stars that can produce X-ray and soft gamma-ray emissions and that have a dipole of 1014 G to 1015 G. A promising mechanism to explain magnetar formation is magnetic field amplification by the MRI in fast-rotating protoneutron stars (PNS). This scenario is supported by recent global models showing that small-scale turbulence can generate a dipole with magnetar-like intensity. However, the impact of buoyancy and density stratification on the efficiency of the MRI at generating a dipole is still unknown. We assess the impact of the density and entropy profiles on the MRI dynamo in a global model of a fast-rotating PNS, which focuses on its outer stratified region stable to convection. Using the pseudo-spectral code MagIC, we perform three-dimensional Boussinesq and anelastic MHD simulations in spherical geometry with explicit diffusivities. We perform a parameter study in which we investigate the effect of different approximations and of thermal diffusion. We obtain a self-sustained turbulent MRI-driven dynamo, which confirms most of our previous incompressible results once rescaled for density. The MRI also generates a non-dominant equatorial dipole, which represents about 4.3\% of the averaged magnetic field strength. Interestingly, in the presence of a density gradient, an axisymmetric magnetic field at large scales oscillates with time, which can be described as a mean-field alpha−Omega dynamo. Buoyancy damps turbulence in the equatorial plane but it has overall a relatively weak influence with a realistic high thermal diffusion. Our results support the ability of the MRI to generate magnetar-like large-scale magnetic fields. They furthermore predict the presence of an alpha−Omega dynamo in the protoneutron star, which could be important to model in-situ magnetic field amplification in core-collapse supernovae. [abridged]

title: Prospects of calibrating afterglow modeling of short GRBs with gravitational wave inclination angle measurements and resolving the Hubble constant tension with a GW/GRB association event
authors: Yi-Ying Wang, Shao-Peng Tang, Xin-Yu Li, Zhi-Ping Jin, Yi-Zhong Fan
topic: In the numerical modeling of the GRB afterglow, for simplicity, some approximations have been made and different groups developed their own codes. A robust test of these modeling/approaches is challenging because of the lack of directly measured physical parameters. Fortunately, the viewing angle inferred from the afterglow modeling is widely anticipated to be the same as the inclination angle of the binary neutron star (BNS) mergers that can be evaluated with the gravitational wave (GW) data. Therefore in the future, it is possible to calibrate the afterglow modeling with the GW inclination angle measurements. We take three methods, including both analytical estimations and direct simulations, to project the uncertainties of the inclination angle measurements. For some BNS mergers accompanied with electromagnetic counterparts detected in the O4/O5 runs of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA/LIGO-India detectors, we show that the inclination angle can be determined within an uncertainty of less 0.1 rad, supposing that the Hubble constant is known with an accuracy of less 3%. The off-axis GRB outflow will give rise to afterglow emission and the most energetic ones may be detectable at the distance of 100-200 Mpc even for a viewing angle of greater 0.3 rad. Such events can thus serve as a robust test of the afterglow modeling approach. We have also evaluated the prospect of resolving the so-called Hubble constant tension with a single GW/GRB association event. We find out that a 3% precision Hubble constant is obtainable if the uncertainty of the viewing angle can be constrained to be within 0.1 rad, which is expected to be the case for some nearby (less 250 Mpc) bright/on-axis GRBs with a well behavioured afterglow light curve displaying a clear achromatic break at early times.

authors: Mikhail M. Meskhi, Noah E. Wolfe, Zhenyu Dai, Carla Frohlich, Jonah M. Miller, Raymond K. W. Wong, Ricardo Vilalta
topic: Understanding how matter behaves at the highest densities and temperatures is a major open problem in both nuclear physics and relativistic astrophysics. This physics is often encapsulated in the so-called high-temperature nuclear equation of state, which influences compact binary mergers, core-collapse supernovae, and many more phenomena. One such case is the type (either black hole or neutron star) and mass of the remnant of the core collapse of a massive star. For each of six candidate equations of state, we use a very large suite of spherically symmetric supernova models to generate a suite of synthetic populations of such remnants. We then compare these synthetic populations to the observed remnant population. We thus provide a novel constraint on the high-temperature nuclear equation of state and describe which EOS candidates are more or less favored by this metric.

title: An efficient method for fitting radiation-mediated shocks to gamma-ray burst data: The Kompaneets RMS approximation
authors: Filip Samuelsson, Christoffer Lundman, Felix Ryde
topic: Shocks that occur below a gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet photosphere are mediated by radiation. Such radiation-mediated shocks (RMSs) could be responsible for shaping the prompt GRB emission. Although well studied theoretically, RMS models have not yet been fitted to data due to the computational cost of simulating RMSs from first principles. Here, we bridge the gap between theory and observations by developing an approximate method capable of accurately reproducing radiation spectra from mildly relativistic (in the shock frame) or slower RMSs, called the Kompaneets RMS approximation (KRA). The approximation is based on the similarities between thermal Comptonization of radiation and the bulk Comptonization that occurs inside an RMS. We validate the method by comparing simulated KRA radiation spectra to first-principle radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement both inside the RMS and in the RMS downstream. The KRA is then applied to a shock scenario inside a GRB jet, allowing for fast and efficient fitting to GRB data. We illustrate the capabilities of the developed method by performing a fit to a non-thermal spectrum in GRB 150314A. The fit allows us to uncover the physical properties of the RMS responsible for the prompt emission, such as the shock speed and the upstream plasma temperature.

title: Magnetohydrodynamic simulations of self-consistent rotating neutron stars with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields
authors: Antonios Tsokaros, Milton Ruiz, Stuart L. Shapiro, Kōji Uryū
topic: We perform the first magnetohydrodynamic simulations in full general relativity of self-consistent rotating neutron stars (NSs) with ultrastrong mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields. The initial uniformly rotating NS models are computed assuming perfect conductivity, stationarity, and axisymmetry. Although the specific geometry of the mixed field configuration can delay or accelerate the development of various instabilities known from analytic perturbative studies, all our models finally succumb to them. Differential rotation is developed spontaneously in the cores of our magnetars which, after sufficient time, is converted back to uniform rotation. The rapidly rotating magnetars show a significant amount of ejecta, which can be responsible for transient kilonova signatures. However no highly collimated, helical magnetic fields or incipient jets, which are necessary for gamma-ray bursts, arise at the poles of these magnetars by the time our simulations are terminated.

title: Statistical analyses on the energies of X-ray plateaus and flares in gamma-ray bursts
authors: Shuang-Xi Yi, Mei Du, Tong Liu
topic: Distinct X-ray plateau and flare phases have been observed in the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and most of them should be related to central engine activities. In this paper, we collect 174 GRBs with X-ray plateau phases and 106 GRBs with X-ray flares. There are 51 GRBs that overlap in the two selected samples. We analyze the distributions of the proportions of the plateau energy Eplateau and the flare energy Eflare relative to the isotropic prompt emission energy Egamma, iso. The results indicate that they well meet the Gaussian distributions and the medians of the logarithmic ratios are -0.96 and -1.39 in the two cases. Moreover, strong positive correlations between Eplateau (or Eflare) and Egamma,iso with slopes of -0.95 (or -0.80) are presented. For the overlapping sample, the slope is -0.80. We argue that most of X-ray plateaus and flares might have the same physical origin but appear with different features because of the different circumstances and radiation mechanisms. We also test the applicabilities of two models, i.e., black holes surrounded by fractured hyperaccretion disks and millisecond magnetars, on the origins of X-ray plateaus and flares.

title: Magnetized black holes: the role of rotation, boost, and accretion in twisting the field lines and accelerating particles
authors: Ondrej Kopacek, Vladimir Karas
topic: Combined influence of rotation of a black hole and ambient magnetic fields creates conditions for powerful astrophysical processes of accretion and outflow of matter which are observed in many systems across the range of masses; from stellar-mass black holes in binary systems to supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. We study a simplified model of outflow of electrically charged particles from the inner region of an accretion disk around a spinning (Kerr) black hole immersed in a large-scale magnetic field. In particular, we consider a non-axisymmetric magnetosphere where the field is misaligned with the rotation axis. In this contribution we extend our previous analysis of acceleration of jet-like trajectories of particles escaping from bound circular orbits around a black hole. While we have previously assumed the initial setup of prograde (co-rotating) orbits, here we relax this assumption and we also consider retrograde (counter-rotating) motion. We show that the effect of counter-rotation may considerably increase the probability of escape from the system, and it allows more efficient acceleration of escaping particles to slightly higher energies compared to the co-rotating disk.

topic: Context. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows originate from the interaction between the relativistic ejecta and the surrounding medium. Consequently, their properties depend on several aspects: radiation mechanisms, relativistic shock micro-physics, circumburst environment, and the structure and geometry of the relativistic jet. While the standard afterglow model accounts for the overall spectral and temporal evolution for a number of GRBs, its validity limits emerge when the data set is particularly rich and constraining, especially in the radio band.
Aims. We aimed to model the afterglow of the long GRB160131A (redshift z=0.972), for which we collected a rich, broadband, and accurate data set, spanning from 6x108 to 7x1017 Hz in frequency, and from 330 s to 160 days post burst in time.
Methods. We modelled the spectral and temporal evolution of this GRB afterglow through two approaches: the adoption of empirical functions to model optical/X-rays data set, later assessing their compatibility with the radio domain; the inclusion of the entire multi-frequency data set simultaneously through the Python package named sAGa (Software for AfterGlow Analysis), to come up with an exhaustive and self-consistent description of the micro-physics, geometry, and dynamics of the afterglow.
Results. From deep broadband analysis (from radio to X-ray frequencies) of the afterglow light curves, GRB160131A outflow shows evidence of jetted emission. Moreover, we observe dust extinction in the optical spectra, and energy injection in the optical/X-ray data. Radio spectra are characterised by several peaks, that could be due to either interstellar scintillation (ISS) effects or a multi-component structure.
Conclusions. The inclusion of radio data in the broadband set of GRB160131A makes a self-consistent modelling hardly attainable within the standard model of GRB afterglows.

title: Some Thoughts on the Convective Urca Process
authors: Josiah Schwab
topic: I have repeatedly grappled with the question of how the convective Urca process affects stellar evolution, in particular during the high-density convective carbon burning that can occur in near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs. This manuscript collects some fragmentary thoughts from various failed and abandoned attempts. This is not a complete work, does not provide a comprehensive overview of the literature, and has no definitive conclusions. It is posted in the hope that some part of it might prove useful to someone at some point in the future. I also take this opportunity to include anotter important result of more general interest (Appendix B).

title: Thermal Electrons in Mildly-relativistic Synchrotron Blast-waves
authors: Ben Margalit, Eliot Quataert
topic: Numerical models of collisionless shocks robustly predict an electron distribution comprised of both thermal and non-thermal electrons. Here, we explore in detail the effect of thermal electrons on the emergent synchrotron emission from sub-relativistic shocks. We present a complete thermal + non-thermal synchrotron model and derive properties of the resulting spectrum and light-curves. Using these results we delineate the relative importance of thermal and non-thermal electrons for sub-relativistic shock-powered synchrotron transients. We find that thermal electrons are naturally expected to contribute significantly to the peak emission if the shock velocity is greater 0.2c, but would be mostly undetectable in non-relativistic shocks. This helps explain the dichotomy between typical radio supernovae and the emerging class of AT2018cow-like events. The signpost of thermal electron synchrotron emission is a steep optically-thin spectral index and a ν2 optically-thick spectrum. These spectral features are also predicted to correlate with a steep post-peak light-curve decline rate, broadly consistent with observed AT2018cow-like events. We expect that thermal electrons may be observable in other contexts where mildly-relativistic shocks are present, and briefly estimate this effect for gamma-ray burst afterglows and binary neutron star mergers. Our model can be used to fit spectra and light-curves of events and accounts for both thermal and non-thermal electron populations with no additional physical degrees of freedom.

title: Bayesian reconstruction of nuclear matter parameters from the equation of state of neutron star matter
authors: Sk Md Adil Imam, N. K. Patra, C. Mondal, Tuhin Malik, B. K. Agrawal
topic: The nuclear matter parameters (NMPs), those underlie in the construction of the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star matter, are not directly accessible. The Bayesian approach is applied to reconstruct the posterior distributions of NMPs from the EoS of neutron star matter. The constraints on lower-order parameters as imposed by the finite nuclei observables are incorporated through appropriately chosen prior distributions. The calculations are performed with two sets of pseudo data on the EoS whose true models are known. The median values of second or higher order NMPs show sizeable deviations from their true values and associated uncertainties are also larger. The sources of these uncertainties are intrinsic in nature, identified as (i) the correlations among various NMPs and (ii) the variations in the EoS of symmetric nuclear matter, symmetry energy, and the neutron-proton asymmetry in such a way that the neutron star matter EoS remain almost unaffected.

title: On explaining prompt emission from GRB central engines with photospheric emission model
authors: Mukul Bhattacharya, Pawan Kumar
topic: Although the observed spectra for gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is well constrained, the underlying radiation mechanism is still not very well understood. We explore photospheric emission in GRB jets by modelling the Comptonization of fast cooled synchrotron photons whilst the electrons and protons are accelerated to highly relativistic energies by repeated energy dissipation events as well as Coulomb collisions. In contrast to the previous simulations, we implement realistic photon-to-particle number ratios of Ngamma/Ne-105 or higher, that are consistent with the observed radiation efficiency of relativistic jets. Using our Monte Carlo radiation transfer (MCRaT) code, we can successfully model the prompt emission spectra when the electrons are momentarily accelerated to highly relativistic energies (Lorentz factor -50-100) after getting powered by -30-50 episodic dissipation events in addition to their Coulomb coupling with the jet protons, and for baryonic outflows that originate from moderate optical depths -20−30. We also show that the resultant shape of the photon spectrum is practically independent of the initial photon energy distribution and the jet baryonic energy content, and hence independent of the emission mechanism.

title: Evidence from Disrupted Halo Dwarfs that r-process Enrichment via Neutron Star Mergers is Delayed by 500 Myrs

topic: The astrophysical origins of r-process elements remain elusive. Neutron star mergers (NSMs) and special classes of core-collapse supernovae (rCCSNe) are leading candidates. Due to these channels' distinct characteristic timescales (rCCSNe: prompt, NSMs: delayed), measuring r-process enrichment in galaxies of similar mass, but differing star-formation durations might prove informative. Two recently discovered disrupted dwarfs in the Milky Way's stellar halo, Kraken and \textit{Gaia}-Sausage Enceladus (GSE), afford precisely this opportunity: both have M=108Msun, but differing star-formation durations of 2 Gyrs and 3.6 Gyrs. Here we present R=50,000 Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy for 31 stars from these systems, detecting the r-process element Eu in all stars. Stars from both systems have similar [Mg/H]=-1, but Kraken has a median [Eu/Mg]=-0.1 while GSE has an elevated [Eu/Mg]=0.2. With simple models we argue NSM enrichment must be delayed by 500-1000 Myrs to produce this difference. rCCSNe must also contribute, especially at early epochs, otherwise stars formed during the delay period would be Eu-free. In this picture, rCCSNe account for =50% of the Eu in Kraken, =25% in GSE, and =15% in dwarfs with extended star-formation durations like Sagittarius. The inferred delay time for NSM enrichment is 10-100x longer than merger delay times from stellar population synthesis -- this is not necessarily surprising because the enrichment delay includes time taken for NSM ejecta to be incorporated into subsequent generations of stars. For example, this may be due to natal kicks that result in r-enriched material deposited far from star-forming gas, which then takes 108-109 years to cool in these galaxies.

title: A roadmap to gamma-ray bursts: new developments and applications to cosmology
authors: Orlando Luongo, Marco Muccino
topic: Gamma-ray bursts are the most powerful explosions in the universe and are mainly placed at very large redshifts, up to z=9. In this short review, we first discuss gamma-ray burst classification and morphological properties. We then report the likely relations between gamma-ray bursts and other astronomical objects, such as black holes, supernovae, neutron stars, etc., discussing in detail gamma-ray burst progenitors. We classify long and short gamma-ray bursts, working out their timescales, and introduce the standard fireball model. Afterwards, we focus on direct applications of gamma-ray bursts to cosmology and underline under which conditions such sources would act as perfect standard candles if correlations between photometric and spectroscopic properties were not jeopardized by the \emph{circularity problem}. In this respect, we underline how the shortage of low-z gamma-ray bursts prevents anchor gamma-ray bursts with primary distance indicators. Moreover, we analyze in detail the most adopted gamma-ray burst correlations, highlighting their main differences. We therefore show calibration techniques, comparing such treatments with non-calibration scenarios. For completeness, we discuss the physical properties of the correlation scatters and systematics occurring during experimental computations. Finally, we develop the most recent statistical methods, star formation rate and high-redshift gamma-ray burst excess and show the most recent constraints got from experimental analyses.

title: Can fermion-boson stars reconcile multi-messenger observations of compact stars?
authors: Fabrizio Di Giovanni, Nicolas Sanchis-Gual, Pablo Cerdá-Durán, José Antonio Font
topic: Mixed fermion-boson stars are stable, horizonless, everywhere regular solutions of the coupled Einstein-(complex, massive) Klein-Gordon-Euler system. While isolated neutron stars and boson stars are uniquely determined by their central energy density, mixed configurations conform an extended parameter space that depends on the combination of the number of fermions and (ultra-light) bosons. The wider possibilities offered by fermion-boson stars could help explain the tension in the measurements of neutron star masses and radii reported in recent multi-messenger observations and nuclear-physics experiments. In this work we construct equilibrium configurations of mixed fermion-boson stars with realistic equations of state for the fermionic component and different percentages of bosonic matter. We show that our solutions are in excellent agreement with multi-messenger data, including gravitational-wave events GW170817 and GW190814 and X-ray pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as with nuclear physics constraints from the PREX-2 experiment.

title: A Simple Model of Radiation from a Magnetized Neutron Star: Accreted Matter and Polar Hotspots
authors: D. G. Yakovlev
topic: A simple and well known model for thermal radiation spectra from a magnetized neutron star is further studied. The model assumes that the star is internally isothermal and possesses dipole magnetic field (B 1e14 G) in the outer heat-insulating layer. The heat transport through this layer makes the surface temperature distribution anisotropic; any local surface element is assumed to emit a blackbody (BB) radiation with a local effective temperature. It is shown that this thermal emission is nearly independent of the chemical composition of insulating envelope (at the same taken averaged effective surface temperature). Adding a slight extra heating of magnetic poles allows one to be qualitatively consistent with observations of some isolated neutron stars.

title: Monte Carlo Simulations of Photospheric Emission in Gamma Ray Bursts
authors: Tyler Parsotan, Davide Lazzati
topic: The study of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) has the potential to improve our understanding of high energy astrophysical phenomena. In order to reliably use GRBs to this end, we first need to have a well-developed grasp of the mechanism that produces the radiation within GRB jets and how that relates to their structure. One model for the emission mechanism of GRBs invokes radiation produced deep in the jet which eventually escapes the jet at its photosphere. While this model has been able to explain a number of observed GRB characteristics, it is currently lacking in predictive power and in ability to fully reproduce GRB spectra. In order to address these shortcomings of the model, we have expanded the capabilities of the MCRaT code, a state of the art radiative transfer code that can now simulate optical to gamma ray radiation propagating in a hydrodynamically simulated GRB jet. Using the MCRaT code, we have constructed mock observed light curves, spectra, and polarization from optical to gamma ray energies for the simulated GRBs. Using these mock observables, we have compared our simulations of photospheric emission to observations and found much agreement between the two. Furthermore, the MCRaT calculations combined with the hydrodynamical simulations allow us to connect the mock observables to the structure of the simulated GRB jet in a way that was not previously possible. While there are a number of improvements that can be made to the analyses, the steps taken here begin to pave the way for us to fully understand the connection between the structure of a given GRB jet and the radiation that would be expected from it.

authors: R. Moradi, J. A. Rueda, R. Ruffini, Liang Li, C. L. Bianco, S. Campion, C. Cherubini, S. Filippi, Y. Wang, S. S. Xue
topic: We address the physical origin of the ultrarelativistic prompt emission (UPE) phase of GRB 190114C observed in the interval 1.9-3.99 s, by the Fermi-GBM in 10 keV-10 MeV . Thanks to high S/N ratio of Fermi-GBM data, a time resolved spectral analysis has evidenced a sequence of similar blackbody plus cutoff power-law spectra, on ever decreasing time intervals during the entire UPE phase. We assume that during the UPE phase, the inner engine of the GRB, composed of a Kerr black hole and a uniform test magnetic field B0, aligned with the BH rotation axis, operates in an overcritical field. We infer an e-positron pair electromagnetic plasma in presence of a baryon load, a PEMB pulse, originating from a vacuum polarization quantum process in the inner engine. This initially optically thick plasma self-accelerates, giving rise at the transparency radius to the MeV radiation observed by Ferm-GBM. At trf larger 3.99 s, the electric field becomes undercritical, and the inner engine operates in the classical electrodynamics regime and generate the GeV emission. During both the quantum and the classical electrodynamics processes, we determine the time varying mass and spin of the Kerr BH in the inner engine, fulfilling the Christodoulou-Hawking-Ruffini mass-energy formula. For the first time, we quantitatively show how the inner engine, by extracting the rotational energy of the Kerr BH, produces a series of PEMB pulses. We follow the quantum vacuum polarization process in sequences with decreasing time bins. We compute the Lorentz factors, the baryon loads and the radii at transparency, as well as the value of the magnetic field, assumed to be constant in each sequence. The fundamental hierarchical structure, linking the quantum electrodynamics regime to the classical electrodynamics regime, is characterized by the emission of blackholic quanta with a timescale t=10-9s, and energy E=1045 erg.

topic: We report the results of our follow-up campaign for the neutron star - black hole (NSBH) merger GW200115 detected during the O3 run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. We obtained wide-field observations with the Deca-Degree Optical Transient Imager (DDOTI) covering 20\% of the total probability area down to a limiting magnitude of w=20.5 AB at 23 h after the merger. Our search for counterparts returns a single candidate (AT2020aeo), likely not associate to the merger. In total, only 25 sources of interest were identified by the community and later discarded as unrelated to the GW event. We compare our upper limits with the emission predicted by state-of-the-art kilonova simulations and disfavor high mass ejecta (larger than0.1Msun), indicating that the spin of the system is not particularly high. By combining our optical limits with gamma-ray constraints from Swift and Fermi, we disfavor the presence of a standard short duration burst for viewing angles less 15 deg from the jet axis. Our conclusions are however limited by the large localization region of this GW event, and accurate prompt positions remain crucial to improving the efficiency of follow-up efforts.

title: Jet Launching from Merging Magnetized Binary Neutron Stars with Realistic Equations of State
authors: Milton Ruiz, Antonios Tsokaros, Stuart L. Shapiro
topic: We perform general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of binary neutron stars in quasi-circular orbit that merge and undergo delayed or prompt collapse to a black hole (BH). The stars are irrotational and modeled using an SLy or an H4 nuclear equation of state. To assess the impact of the initial magnetic field configuration on jet launching, we endow the stars with a purely poloidal magnetic field that is initially unimportant dynamically and is either confined to the stellar interior or extends from the interior into the exterior as in typical pulsars. Consistent with our previous results, we find that only the BH + disk remnants originating from binaries that form hypermassive neutron stars (HMNSs) and undergo delayed collapse can drive magnetically-powered jets. We find that the closer the total mass of the binary is to the threshold value for prompt collapse, the shorter is the time delay between the gravitational wave peak amplitude and jet launching. This time delay also strongly depends on the initial magnetic field configuration. We also find that seed magnetic fields confined to the stellar interior can launch a jet over 25ms later than those with pulsar-like magnetic fields. The lifetime of the jet [150ms] and its outgoing Poynting luminosity [LEM 1052 pm 1 erg/s] are consistent with typical short gamma-ray burst central engine lifetimes, as well as with the Blandford--Znajek mechanism for launching jets and their associated Poynting luminosities. Our numerical results also suggest that the dynamical ejection of matter can be enhanced by the magnetic field. Therefore, GRMHD studies are required to fully understand kilonova signals from GW170818-like events.

title: The impact of natal kicks on galactic r-process enrichment by neutron star mergers
authors: Freeke van de Voort (1), Rüdiger Pakmor (2), Rebekka Bieri (2), Robert J. J. Grand 
topic: We study galactic enrichment with rapid neutron capture (r-process) elements in cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical simulations of a Milky Way-mass galaxy. We include a variety of enrichment models, based on either neutron star mergers or a rare class of core-collapse supernova as sole r-process sources. For the first time in cosmological simulations, we implement neutron star natal kicks on-the-fly to study their impact. With kicks, neutron star mergers are more likely to occur outside the galaxy disc, but how far the binaries travel before merging also depends on the kick velocity distribution and shape of the delay time distribution for neutron star mergers. In our fiducial model, the median r-process abundance ratio is somewhat lower and the trend with metallicity is slightly steeper when kicks are included. In a model 'optimized' to better match observations, with a higher rate of early neutron star mergers, the median r-process abundances are fairly unaffected by kicks. In both models, the scatter in r-process abundances is much larger with natal kicks, especially at low metallicity, giving rise to more r-process enhanced stars. We experimented with a range of kick velocities and find that with lower velocities, the scatter is reduced, but still larger than without natal kicks. We discuss the possibility that the observed scatter in r-process abundances is predominantly caused by natal kicks removing the r-process sources far from their birth sites, making enrichment more inhomogeneous, rather than the usual interpretation that the scatter is set by the rarity of its production source.

title: A novel fourth-order WENO interpolation technique. A possible new tool designed for radiative transfer
authors: Gioele Janett, Oskar Steiner, Ernest Alsina Ballester, Luca Belluzzi, Siddhartha Mishra
topic: Context. Several numerical problems require the interpolation of discrete data that present various types of discontinuities. The radiative transfer is a typical example of such a problem. This calls for high-order well-behaved techniques to interpolate both smooth and discontinuous data. Aims. The final aim is to propose new techniques suitable for applications in the context of numerical radiative transfer. Methods. We have proposed and tested two different techniques. Essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) techniques generate several candidate interpolations based on different substencils. The smoothest candidate interpolation is determined from a measure for the local smoothness, thereby enabling the essential non-oscillatory property. Weighted ENO (WENO) techniques use a convex combination of all candidate substencils to obtain high-order accuracy in smooth regions while keeping the essentially non-oscillatory property. In particular, we have outlined and tested a novel well-performing fourth-order WENO interpolation technique for both uniform and nonuniform grids. Results. Numerical tests prove that the fourth-order WENO interpolation guarantees fourth-order accuracy in smooth regions of the interpolated functions. In the presence of discontinuities, the fourth-order WENO interpolation enables the non-oscillatory property, avoiding oscillations. Unlike Bezier and monotonic high-order Hermite interpolations, it does not degenerate to a linear interpolation near smooth extrema of the interpolated function. Conclusions. The novel fourth-order WENO interpolation guarantees high accuracy in smooth regions, while effectively handling discontinuities. This interpolation technique might be particularly suitable for several problems, including a number of radiative transfer applications such as multidimensional problems, multigrid methods, and formal solutions.

topic: Relativistic jets can interact with the ambient gas distribution of the host galaxy, before breaking out to larger scales. In the past decade several studies have simulated jet-driven outflows to understand how they affect the nearby environment, and over what spatial and temporal scales such interactions occur. The simulations are able to capture the interaction of the jets with the turbulent clumpy interstellar medium and the resultant energetics of the gas. In this review we summarise the results of such recent studies and discuss their implications on the evolution of the dynamics of the gas distribution and the star formation rate.

title: Quantifying modelling uncertainties when combining multiple gravitational-wave detections from binary neutron star sources
authors: Nina Kunert, Peter T. H. Pang, Ingo Tews, Michael W. Coughlin, Tim Dietrich
topic: With the increasing sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors, we expect to observe multiple binary neutron-star systems through gravitational waves in the near future. The combined analysis of these gravitational-wave signals offers the possibility to constrain the neutron-star radius and the equation of state of dense nuclear matter with unprecedented accuracy. However, it is crucial to ensure that uncertainties inherent in the gravitational-wave models will not lead to systematic biases when information from multiple detections are combined. To quantify waveform systematics, we perform an extensive simulation campaign of binary neutron-star sources and analyse them with a set of four different waveform models. Based on our analysis with about 38 simulations, we find that statistical uncertainties in the neutron-star radius decrease to 250m (2\% at 90\% credible interval) but that systematic differences between currently employed waveform models can be twice as large. Hence, it will be essential to ensure that systematic biases will not become dominant in inferences of the neutron-star equation of state when capitalizing on future developments.

title: Radio relics radio emission from multi-shock scenario
authors: Giannandrea Inchingolo, Denis Wittor, Kamlesh Rajpurohit, Franco Vazza
topic: Radio relics are giant (Mpc) synchrotron sources that are believed to be produced by the (re)acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) by shocks in the intracluster medium. In this numerical study, we focus on the possibility that some radio relics may arise when electrons undergo diffusive shock acceleration at multiple shocks in the outskirts of merging galaxy clusters. This multi-shock (MS) scenario appears viable to produce CRe that emit visible synchrotron emission. We show that electrons that have been shocked multiple times develop an energy spectrum that significantly differs from the power-law spectrum expected in the case of a single shock scenario. As a consequence, the radio emission generated by CRe that shocked multiple times is higher than the emission produced by CRe that are shocked only once. In the case explored in this paper, the radio emission produced in the two scenarios differ by one order of magnitude. In particular in the MS scenario, the simulated relic follows a KGJP spectral shape, consistent with observation. Furthermore, the produced radio emission is large enough to be detectable with current radio telescopes (e.g. LOFAR, JVLA).

title: A Toy Model for the Time-Frequency Structure of Fast Radio Bursts: Implications for the CHIME Burst Dichotomy
authors: Brian D. Metzger, Navin Sridhar, Ben Margalit, Paz Beniamini, Lorenzo Sironi
topic: We introduce a toy model for the time-frequency structure of fast radio bursts (FRB), in which the observed emission is produced as a narrowly-peaked intrinsic spectral energy distribution sweeps down in frequency across the instrumental bandpass as a power-law in time. Though originally motivated by emission models which invoke a relativistic shock, the model could in principle apply to a wider range of emission scenarios. We quantify the burst's detectability using the frequency bandwidth over which most of its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is accumulated. We demonstrate that by varying just a single parameter of the toy model-the power-law index \beta of the frequency drift rate-one can transform a long (and hence preferentially time-resolved) burst with a narrow time-integrated spectrum into a shorter burst with a broad power-law time-integrated spectrum. We suggest that burst-to-burst diversity in the value of \beta could generate the dichotomy between burst duration and frequency-width recently found by CHIME. In shock models, the value of \beta is related to the radial density profile of external medium, which in light of the preferentially longer duration of bursts from repeating sources may point to diversity in the external environments surrounding repeating versus one-off FRB sources.

title: Kilonova and Optical Afterglow from Binary Neutron Star Mergers. II. Optimal Search Strategy for Serendipitous Observations and Target-of-opportunity Observations of Gravitational-wave Triggers
authors: Jin-Ping Zhu, Shichao Wu, Yuan-Pei Yang, Bing Zhang, Hao-Ran Song, He Gao, Zhoujian Cao, Yun-Wei Yu
topic: In the second work of this series, we explore the optimal search strategy for serendipitous and gravitational-wave-triggered target-of-opportunity observations of kilonovae (KNe) and optical short-duration gamma-ray burst (sGRB) afterglows (AGs) from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, assuming that cosmological KNe are AT2017gfo-like (but with viewing-angle dependence) and that the properties of AGs are consistent with those of cosmological sGRB AGs. A one-day cadence serendipitous search strategy with an exposure time of 30s can always achieve an optimal search strategy of KNe and AGs for various survey projects. We show that the optimal detection rates of the KN-dominated (AG-dominated) events are 0.2/0.5/0.8/20yr-1 (500/300/600/3000yr-1) for ZTF/Mephisto/WFST/LSST, respectively. A better search strategy for SiTian is to increase the exposure time. SiTian can find 5(6000)yr-1 KN-dominated (AG-dominated) events. We predict abundant off-axis orphan AGs may be recorded in the survey database although not been identified. For target-of-opportunity observations, we simulate the maximum BNS gravitational-wave (GW) detection rates

title: Kilonova and Optical Afterglow from Binary Neutron Star Mergers. I. Luminosity Function and Color Evolution
authors: Jin-Ping Zhu, Yuan-Pei Yang, Bing Zhang, He Gao, Yun-Wei Yu
topic: In the first work of this series, we adopt an AT2017gfo-like viewing-angle-dependent kilonova model and the standard afterglow model with lightcurve distribution based on the cosmological short gamma-ray bursts afterglows to simulate the luminosity functions and color evolution of both kilonovae and optical afterglow emissions from binary neutron star mergers. Only a small fraction of (∼20%) on-axis afterglows are dimmer than the associated kilonovae at the kilonovae peak time. At a very large viewing angle, e.g.,, most kilonovae at the peak time would be much brighter than associated afterglows. Therefore, a large fractional of detectable kilonovae would be significantly polluted by associated afterglow emissions. We find that the maximum possible apparent magnitude for cosmological kilonovae is 27-28mag. Afterglow emission has a wider luminosity function compared with kilonova emission. At brightness dimmer than 25−26mag, according to their luminosity functions, the number of afterglows is much larger than that of kilonovae. Since the search depth of almost all the present and foreseeable survey projects is 25mag, the number of afterglow events detected via serendipitous observations would be much higher than that of kilonova events, consistent with the current observations. We find that it may be difficult to use the fading rate in a single band to directly identify kilonovae and afterglows among various fast-evolving transients by serendipitous surveys, especially if the observations have missed the peak time. However, the color evolution between optical and infrared bands can identify them, since their color evolution patterns are unique compared with those of other fast-evolving transients.

title: Gravitational Waves from GRB Core Spindown
authors: Ioannis Contopoulos, Achilles Strantzalis, Dimitrios Papadopoulos, Demosthenes Kazanas
topic: We investigate long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) which manifest a sharp linear rise followed by an exponential decay in their gamma-ray prompt emission observed with the BAT instrument on board the Swift satellite. We offer a simple electrodynamic model that may account for these particular characteristics. We associate the sharp rise with the winding of the magnetic field by the fast rotating core that formed in the interior of the stellar precursor. We also associate the subsequent exponential decay with the electromagnetic spin-down of the core following the release of the electromagnetic jet from the stellar interior. Any non-axisymmetric distortion in the rotating core will generate gravitational waves with exponentially decreasing frequency, a so-called "down-chirp". We obtain a detailed estimate of the gravitational wave profile if the distortion of spacetime is due to the winding of a non-axisymmetric component of the magnetic field during that particular phase of the burst.

title: Thermal effects on tidal deformability of a coalescing binary neutron star system
authors: A. Kanakis-Pegios, P.S. Koliogiannis, Ch.C. Moustakidis
topic: The study of neutron star mergers by the detection of the emitted gravitational waves is one of the most promised tools to study the properties of dense nuclear matter at high densities. It is worth claiming that, at the moment, strong evidence that the temperature of the stars is zero during the last orbits before coalescing does not exist. Contrariwise, there are some theoretical predictions suggesting that the star's temperature might even be a few MeV. According to the main theory, the tides transfer mechanical energy and angular momentum to the star at the expense of the orbit, where friction within the star converts the mechanical energy into heat. During the inspiral these effects are potentially detectable. Different treatments have been used to estimate the transfer of the mechanical energy and the size of the tidal friction, leading to different conclusions about the importance of pre-merger tidal effects. The present work is dedicated to the study of the effect of temperature on the tidal deformability of neutron stars during the inspiral of a neutron star system just before the merger. We applied a class of hot equations of state originated from various nuclear models and found that even for low values of temperature (T<1 MeV) the effects on the basic ingredients of tidal deformability are not negligible. However, according to the main finding, the effect of the temperature on the tidal deformability is indistinguishable. The consequences of this unexpected result are discussed and analyzed.

authors: Ben S. Prather, George N. Wong, Vedant Dhruv, Benjamin R. Ryan, Joshua C. Dolence, Sean M. Ressler, Charles F. Gammie
topic: Iharm3D is an open-source C code for simulating black hole accretion systems in arbitrary stationary spacetimes using ideal general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). It is an implementation of the HARM ("High Accuracy Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics") algorithm outlined in Gammie et al. (2003) with updates as outlined in McKinney & Gammie (2004) and Noble et al. (2006). The code is most directly derived from Ryan et al. (2015) but with radiative transfer portions removed. HARM is a conservative finite-volume scheme for solving the equations of ideal GRMHD, a hyperbolic system of partial differential equations, on a logically Cartesian mesh in arbitrary coordinates.

title: Non-thermal particle acceleration at highly oblique non-relativistic shocks
authors: Naveen Kumar, Brian Reville
topic: The non-thermal acceleration of electrons and ions at an oblique, non-relativistic shock is studied using large scale particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations in one spatial dimension. Physical parameters are selected to highlight the role of electron pre-heating in injection and subsequent acceleration of particles at high Mach number shocks. Simulation results show evidence for the early onset of the diffusive shock acceleration process for both electrons and ions at a highly oblique subluminal shock. Ion acceleration efficiencies of 5% are measured at late times, though this is not the saturated value.

title: Multimodal analysis of Gravitational Wave signals and Gamma-Ray Bursts from binary neutron star mergers
authors: Elena Cuoco, Barbara Patricelli, Alberto Iess, Filip Morawski
topic: A major boost in the understanding of the universe was given by the revelation of the first coalescence event of two neutron stars (GW170817) and the observation of the same event across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. With 3rd Generation gravitational wave detectors and the new astronomical facilities, we expect many multi messenger events of the same type. We anticipate the need to analyse the data provided to us by such events, to fulfill the requirements of real-time analysis, but also in order to decipher the event in its entirety through the information emitted in the different messengers using Machine Learning. We propose a change in the paradigm in the way we will do multi-messenger astronomy, using simultaneously the complete information generated by violent phenomena in the Universe. What we propose is the application of a multimodal machine learning approach to characterize these events.

title: Black hole-neutron star mergers are unlikely multi-messenger sources
authors: Giacomo Fragione
topic: The promise by the LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) collaboration to detect black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) mergers via gravitational wave (GW) emission has recently been fulfilled with the detection of GW200105 and GW200115. Mergers of BH-NS binaries are particularly exciting for their multi-messenger potential, since the GW detection can be followed by an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart (kilonova, gamma-ray burst, afterglow) that can reveal important information on the equation of state (EOS) of NSs and the nature of the BH spin. This can happen whenever the NS does not directly plunge into the BH, but rather is tidally disrupted leaving behind debris to accrete. We carry out a statistical study of the binary stars that evolve to form a BH-NS binary and compute the rate of merger events that can be followed by an EM counterpart. We find that 50\% of the mergers can lead to an EM counterpart only in the case BHs are born highly spinning, otherwise this fraction never exceeds about 30% for stiff NS EOSs and a few percent for soft NS EOSs. However, the possibilities that BHs are born with near-maximal spins and that NS internal structure is described by a stiff EOS are disfavored by current LVK constraints. Considering that these values only represent an upper limit to observe an EM counterpart due to current observational limitations, as in brightness sensitivity and sky localization, BH-NS mergers are unlikely multi-messenger sources.

title: Accretion onto black holes inside neutron stars with realistic nuclear equations of state: analytic and numerical treatments
authors: Sophia C. Schnauck, Thomas W. Baumgarte, Stuart L. Shapiro
topic: We consider spherically symmetric accretion onto a small, possibly primordial, black hole residing at the center of a neutron star governed by a realistic cold nuclear equation of state (EOS). We generalize the relativistic Bondi solution for such EOSs, approximated by piecewise polytropes, and thereby obtain analytical expressions for the steady-state matter profiles and accretion rates. We compare these rates with those found by time-dependent, general relativistic hydrodynamical simulations upon relaxation and find excellent agreement. We consider several different candidate EOSs, neutron star masses and central densities and find that the accretion rates vary only little, resulting in an accretion rate that depends primarily on the black hole mass, and only weakly on the properties of the neutron star. However, we also find that several of the resulting fluid profiles feature superluminal sound speeds outside black hole horizons, indicating that either the corresponding EOSs, or their piecewise polytrope representations, are no longer adequate for the supranuclear densities encountered in these flows.

title: Overall Spectral Properties of Prompt Emissions with Diverse Segments in Swift/BAT Short Gamma-ray Bursts
authors: X.J. Li, Z.B. Zhang, K. Zhang
topic: Owing to lack of multiple components of prompt gamma-ray emissions in short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), how these distinct components are correlated still keeps unclear. In this paper, we investigate the spectral and temporal properties of precursors, main peaks and extended emissions in 26 sGRBs including GRB 170817A. It is found that peak energies (Ep) in each pulse are uncorrelated with the pulse duration (tdur). Meanwhile, we find that there is no obvious correlation between peak energy and energy fluence. Interestingly, there is no obvious spectral evolution from earlier precursors to later extended emissions in view of the correlations of tdur with either the Ep or the low energy spectrum index, alpha. A power-law correlation between the average flux (Fp) and the energy fluence (Sgamma), logFp=(0.62pm0.07)logSgamma+(0.27pm0.07), is found to exist in the individual segments instead of mean peaks previously. Furthermore, we also find that the main peaks are on average brighter than the precursors or the extend emissions about one order of magnitude. On the basis of all the above analyses, one can conclude that three emissive components would share the same radiation mechanisms but they might be dominated by diverse physical processes.

title: Effects of radiative losses on the relativistic jets of high-mass microquasars
authors: A. Charlet, R. Walder, A. Marcowith, D. Folini, J. M. Favre, M. E. Dieckmann
topic: Context. Relativistic jets are ubiquitous in astrophysics. High Mass Microquasars (HMMQs) are useful labs to study such jets, as they are relatively close and evolve over observable time scales. The ambient medium into which the jet propagates is, however, far from homogeneous. Corresponding simulation studies to date consider various forms of a wind-shaped ambient medium but typically neglect radiative cooling and relativistic effects. Aims. We investigate the dynamical and structural effects of radiative losses and system parameters on relativistic jets in HMMQs, from the jet launch to its propagation over several tens of orbital separations. Methods. We use 3D relativistic hydrodynamical simulations including parameterized radiative cooling derived from relativistic thermal plasma distribution to carry out parameter studies around two fiducial cases inspired by Cygnus X-1 and Cygnus X-3. Results. Radiative losses are found to be more relevant in Cygnus X-3 than Cygnus X-1. Varying jet power, jet temperature, or the wind of the donor star tends to have a larger impact at early times, when the jet forms and instabilities initially develop, than at later times when the jet has reached a turbulent state. Conclusions. Radiative losses may be dynamically and structurally relevant at least in Cygnus X-3 case, and thus should be examined in more detail.

title: GRB variabilities and following gravitational waves induced by gravitational instability in NDAFs
authors: Narjes Shahamat, Shahram Abbassi, Tong Liu
topic: The present work proposes a new formalism for the inner regions of a neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) by considering the self-gravity, where the neutrino opacity is high enough to make neutrinos trapped becoming a dominant factor in the transportation of energy and angular momentum over the magneto rotational instability. We investigate the possibility of gravitational instability and fragmentation to model the highly variable structure of the prompt emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The results lead us to introduce the gravitational instability, in these inner regions, as a source of a new viscosity which is of the same functional form as that of the beta-prescription of viscosity. Such a consideration brings about fragmentation in the unstable inner disk. In addition, we find the consequent clumpy structure of this area capable to account for the temporal variability of GRB's light curve, especially for the lower choices of the parameter beta, 10−5. Finally, we predict the formation of gravitational waves through the migration of fragments before being tidally disrupted. These waves appear to be detectable via a range of current and future detectors from LIGO to Cosmic Explorer.

title: A Nuclear Equation of State Inferred from Stellar r-Process Abundances
authors: Erika M. Holmbeck, Richard O'Shaughnessy, Vera Delfavero, Krzysztof Belczynski
topic: Binary neutron star mergers (NSMs) have been confirmed as one source of the heaviest observable elements made by the rapid neutron-capture (r-) process. However, modeling NSM outflows -- from the total ejecta masses to their elemental yields -- depends on the unknown nuclear equation of state (EOS) that governs neutron-star structure. In this work, we derive a phenomenological EOS by assuming that NSMs are the dominant sources of the heavy-element material in metal-poor stars with r-process abundance patterns. We start with a population synthesis model to obtain a population of merging neutron star binaries and calculate their EOS-dependent elemental yields. Under the assumption that these mergers were responsible for the majority of r-process elements in the metal-poor stars, we find parameters representing the EOS for which the theoretical NSM yields reproduce the derived abundances from observations of metal-poor stars. For our proof-of-concept assumptions, we find an EOS that is slightly softer than, but still in agreement with, current constraints, e.g., by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), with R1.4=12.25pm0.03 km and MTOV of 2.17pm0.03-Msun(statistical uncertainties, neglecting modeling systematics).

title: GRB 101225A as Orphan Dipole Radiation of a Newborn Magnetar with Precession Rotation in an Off-Axis Gamma-Ray Burst
authors: Le Zou, Tian-Ci Zheng, Xing Yang, Hai-ming Zhang, Xiao-Yan Li, Jia Ren, Da-Bin Lin, En-Wei Liang
topic: The unusual multiwavelength lightcurves of GRB 101225A are revisited by assuming that it is from an off-axis GRB powered by a newborn magnetar. We show that its optical afterglow lightcurve is fitted with the forward shock model by parameterizing its jet structure as a Gaussian function with a half opening angle of the jet core as 1.67. The derived initial Lorentz factor (G0) is 120, and the viewing angle to the jet axis is theta=3.7. Tentative QPO signatures of P=488 seconds and P=250-300 seconds are found with a confidence level of 90\% by analysing its X-ray flares observed in the time interval of [4900, 7500] seconds. Its global gamma-ray/X-ray lightcurve and the QPO signatures are represented with the magnetar dipole radiation (DR) model by considering the magnetar precession motion, assuming that the magnetar spindown is dominated by the GW emission. The bulk Lorentz factor of the DR ejecta is limited to 8, being much lower than G0. Comparing GRB 101225A with the extremely off-axis GRB 170817A, we suspect that the nature of the two-component jet in GRB 170817A is a combination of a co-axial GRB jet and a DR ejecta. GRB 101225A would be among the brightest ones of the CDF-S XT2 like X-ray transient population driven by newborn magnetars. Discussion on detectability of its gravitational wave emission is also presented.

First, high-precision computations of black hole--neutron star binaries in quasiequilibrium circular orbits are summarized, focusing on the quasiequilibrium sequences and the mass-shedding limit. Next, the current status of numerical-relativity simulations for the merger of black hole--neutron star binaries is described. We summarize our understanding for the merger process, tidal disruption and its criterion, properties of the merger remnant and ejected material, gravitational waveforms, and gravitational-wave spectra. We also discuss expected electromagnetic counterparts to black hole--neutron star coalescences.

title: Detectability of continuous gravitational waves from magnetically deformed neutron stars
authors: J. Soldateschi, N. Bucciantini
topic: Extremely powerful magnetic fields are contained inside neutron stars. Their effect is to deform the shape of the star, leading to the emission of continuous gravitational waves. The magnetic deformation of neutron stars depends on the details of their magnetic field, that is its geometry and strength. Moreover, it depends on their composition, described by the equation of state. Unfortunately, both the configuration of the magnetic field and the equation of state of neutron stars are unkown, and assessing the detectability of continuous gravitational waves from neutron stars suffers from these uncertainties. Using our recent results relating the magnetic deformation of a neutron star to its mass and radius, and considering the Galactic pulsar population, we assess the detectability of continuous gravitational waves from pulsars in the Galaxy - described by realistic equations of state currently allowed by observational and nuclear physics constraints - by gravitational waves detectors.

title: Constraints on R-process Nucleosynthesis from 129I and 247Cm in the Early Solar System
authors: Projjwal Banerjee, Meng-Ru Wu, Jeena S. K
topic: GW170817 has confirmed binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs) as one of the sources of nuclei produced by the rapid neutron capture (r) process. However, the details of nucleosynthetic pattern emerging from BNSMs as well as the physical condition of r-process remain unknown. Moreover, additional sites for r-process that have been proposed cannot be ruled out and may even be needed to explain all the observations related to the evolution of r-process elements. The measurement of the abundances of particular short-lived radioactive isotopes (SLRIs) in the early solar system (ESS), that are synthesized almost exclusively by r-process, can provide independent clues regarding the nature of r-process events that occurred during the formation of the SS. In this work, we study the evolution of r-process SLRIs 129I and 247Cm as well as the corresponding reference isotopes 127I and 235U at the Solar location. We consider up to three different sources that have distinct 129I/247Cm production ratios corresponding to the varied r-process conditions in different astrophysical scenarios. In contrast to the results found by Cote et al. (2021), we find that 129I and 247Cm in the ESS do not come entirely from one single major event but get additional contributions from at least 2 more minor contributors. This has a dramatic effect on the evolution of the 129I/247Cm ratio, such that the measured ESS value in meteorites may not correspond to that of the "last" major r-process event. [abridged]

title: Formation and Evolution of Binary Neutron Stars: Mergers and Their Host Galaxies
authors: Qingbo Chu, Shenghua Yu, Youjun Lu 
topic: In this paper, we investigate the properties of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and their mergers by combining population synthesis models for binary stellar evolution (BSE) with cosmological galaxy formation and evolution models. We obtain constraints on BSE model parameters by using the observed Galactic BNSs and local BNS merger rate density (R0) inferred from Gravitational Wave (GW) observations, and consequently estimate the host galaxy distributions of BNS mergers. We find that the Galactic BNS observations imply efficient energy depletion in the common envelope (CE) phase, a bimodal kick velocity distribution, and low mass ejection during the secondary supernova explosion. However, the inferred R0 does not necessarily require an extremely high CE ejection efficiency and low kick velocities, different from the previous claims, mainly because the latest inferred R0 is narrowed to a lower value. The BNS merger rate density resulting from the preferred model can be described by [] at low redshift (z\leq 0.5), with [] and [], respectively. Our results also show that R0 and Xsi depend on settings of BSE model parameters, and thus accurate estimates of these parameters by future GW detections will put strong constraints on BSE models. We further estimate that the fractions of BNS mergers hosted in spiral and elliptical galaxies at z-0 are 81\%-84\% and 16\%-19\%, respectively. The BNS merger rate per galaxy can be well determined by the host galaxy stellar mass, star formation rate, and metallicity, which provides a guidance in search for most probable candidates of BNS host galaxies.

title: Acceleration of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts: concurrence of jet's dynamics and wave-particle interactions
authors: Ze-Lin Zhang, Ruo-Yu Liu, Xiang-Yu Wang
topic: The origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains a mystery. It has been suggested that UHECRs can be produced by the stochastic acceleration in relativistic jets of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at the early afterglow phase. Here, we develop a time-dependent model for proton energization by cascading compressible waves in GRB jets considering the concurrent effect of the jet's dynamics and the mutual interactions between turbulent waves and particles. Considering fast mode of magnetosonic wave as the dominant particle scatterer and assuming interstellar medium (ISM) for the circumburst environment, our numerical results suggest that protons can be accelerated up to 1019eV during the early afterglow. An estimation shows ultra-high energy nuclei can easily survive photodisintegration in the external shocks in most cases, thus allowing the acceleration of 1020eV cosmic-ray nuclei in the proposed frame. The spectral slope can be as hard as dN/dE - E0, which is consistent with the requirement for the interpretation of intermediate-mass composition of UHECR as measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory.

authors: Benjamin D. Wibking, Mark R. Krumholz
topic: We present Quokka, a new subcycling-in-time, block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) radiation hydrodynamics code optimised for graphics processing units (GPUs). Quokka solves the equations of hydrodynamics with the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) in a method-of-lines formulation, and handles radiative transfer via the variable Eddington tensor (VET) radiation moment equations with a local closure. In order to maximise GPU performance, we combine explicit-in-time evolution of the radiation moment equations with the reduced speed-of-light approximation. We show results for a wide range of test problems for hydrodynamics, radiation, and coupled radiation hydrodynamics. On uniform grids in 3D, we achieve a peak of 93 million hydrodynamic updates per second per GPU, and 22 million radiation hydrodynamic updates per second per GPU. For radiation hydrodynamics problems on uniform grids in 3D, our code also scales from 4 GPUs to 256 GPUs with an efficiency of 80 percent. The code is publicly released under an open-source license on GitHub.

title: Evidence of X-ray plateaus driven by the magnetar spindown winds in gamma-ray burst afterglows
authors: Shu-Jin Hou, Shuang Du, Tong Liu, Hui-Jun Mu, Ren-Xin Xu
topic: The central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an open and forefront topic in the era of multimessenger astrophysics. The X-ray plateaus appear in some GRB afterglows, which are widely considered to originate from the spindown of magnetars. According to the stable magnetar scenario of GRBs, an X-ray plateau and a decay phase as t-2 should appear in X-ray afterglows. Meanwhile, the "normal" X-ray afterglow is produced by the external shock from GRB fireball. We analyze the Neil Gehrels \emph{Swift} GRB data, then find three gold samples, which have an X-ray plateau and a decay phase as t-2 superimposed on the jet-driven normal component. Based on these features of the lightcurves, we argue that the magnetars should be the central engines of these three GRBs. Future joint multimessenger observations might further test this possibility, then which can be beneficial to constrain GRB physics.

authors: Constantinos Constantinou, Sophia Han, Prashanth Jaikumar, Madappa Prakash
topic: We perform the first study of the principal core g-mode oscillation in hybrid stars containing quark matter, utilizing a crossover model for the hadron-to-quark transition inspired by lattice QCD. The ensuing results are compared with our recent findings of g-mode frequencies in hybrid stars with a first-order phase transition using Gibbs constructions. We find that models using Gibbs construction yield g-mode amplitudes and the associated gravitational energy radiated that dominate over those of the chosen crossover model owing to the distinct behaviors of the equilibrium and adiabatic sound speeds in the various models. Based on our results, we conclude that were g-modes to be detected in upgraded LIGO and Virgo detectors it would indicate a first-order phase transition akin to a Gibbs construction.

title: Radio Loud vs. Radio Quiet Gamma-ray Bursts: the Role of Binary Progenitors
authors: Nicole M. Lloyd-Ronning
topic: We explore the possibility that radio loud gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) result from the collapse of a massive star in an interacting binary system, while radio quiet GRBs are produced by the collapse of a single massive star. A binary collapsar system can have the necessary angular momentum and energy budget to explain the longer prompt gamma-ray durations and higher isotropic energies seen in the the radio loud sub-sample of long GRBs. Additionally, tidal interactions between the stars in binary systems can lead to rich and extended circumstellar environments that allow for the presence of the long-lived radio afterglows seen in the radio loud systems. Finally, the relative fraction of stars in binary systems versus single star systems appears consistent with the fraction of radio loud versus radio quiet GRBs.

title: Multi-wavelength emission from magnetically arrested disks around isolated black holes
authors: Shigeo S. Kimura, Kazumi Kashiyama, Kenta Hotokezaka
topic: We discuss the prospects for identifying nearest isolated black holes (IBHs) in our Galaxy. IBHs accreting gas from the interstellar medium (ISM) likely form magnetically arrested disks (MADs). We show that thermal electrons in the MADs emit optical signals through the cyclo-synchrotron process while non-thermal electrons accelerated via magnetic reconnections emit a flat-spectrum synchrotron radiation in the X-ray to MeV gamma-ray ranges. The Gaia catalog will include at most a thousand of IBHs within [1 kpc] that are distributed on and around the cooling sequence of white dwarfs (WDs) in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. These IBH candidates should also be detected by eROSITA, with which they can be distinguished from isolated WDs and neutron stars. Followup observations with hard X-ray and MeV gamma-ray satellites will be useful to unambiguously identify IBHs.

title: Black hole to breakout: 3D GRMHD simulations of collapsar jets reveal a wide range of transients
authors: Ore Gottlieb, Aretaios Lalakos, Omer Bromberg, Matthew Liska, Alexander Tchekhovskoy
topic: We present a suite of the first 3D GRMHD collapsar simulations, which extend from the self-consistent jet launching by an accreting Kerr black hole (BH) to the breakout from the star. We identify three types of outflows, depending on the angular momentum, l, of the collapsing material and the magnetic field, B, on the BH horizon: (i) Subrelativistic outflow (low l and high B), (ii) Stationary accretion shock instability (SASI; high l and low B), (iii) Relativistic jets (high l and high B). In the absence of jets, free-fall of the stellar envelope provides a good estimate for the BH accretion rate. Jets can substantially suppress the accretion rate, and their duration can be limited by the magnetization profile in the star. We find that progenitors with large (steep) inner density power-law indices (2), face extreme challenges as gamma-ray burst (GRB) progenitors due to excessive luminosity, global time evolution in the lightcurve throughout the burst and short breakout times, inconsistent with observations. Our results suggest that the wide variety of observed explosion appearances (supernova/supernova+GRB/low-luminosity GRBs) and the characteristics of the emitting relativistic outflows (luminosity and duration) can be naturally explained by the differences in the progenitor structure. Our simulations reveal several important jet features: (i) strong magnetic dissipation inside the star, resulting in weakly magnetized jets by breakout that may have significant photospheric emission and (ii) spontaneous emergence of tilted accretion disk-jet flows, even in the absence of any tilt in the progenitor.

title: A Bayesian Inference Framework for Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow Properties
authors: En-Tzu Lin, Fergus Hayes, Gavin P. Lamb, Ik Siong Heng, Albert K.H. Kong, Michael J. Williams, Surojit Saha, John Veitch
topic: In the field of multi-messenger astronomy, Bayesian inference is commonly adopted to compare the compatibility of models given the observed data. However, to describe a physical system like neutron star mergers and their associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) events, usually more than ten physical parameters are incorporated in the model. With such a complex model, likelihood evaluation for each Monte Carlo sampling point becomes a massive task and requires a significant amount of computational power. In this work, we perform quick parameter estimation on simulated GRB X-ray light curves using an interpolated physical GRB model. This is achieved by generating a grid of GRB afterglow light curves across the parameter space and replacing the likelihood with a simple interpolation function in the high-dimensional grid that stores all light curves. This framework, compared to the original method, leads to a [∼90x] speedup per likelihood estimation. It will allow us to explore different jet models and enable fast model comparison in the future.

topic: GW200115 was the second merger of a black hole and a neutron star confidently detected through gravitational waves. Inference on the signal allows for a large black hole spin misaligned with the orbital angular momentum, but shows little support for aligned spin values. We show that this is a natural consequence of measuring the parameters of a black hole -- neutron star binary with non-spinning components while assuming the priors used in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis. We suggest that, a priori, a non-spinning binary is more consistent with current astrophysical understanding.

topic: The majority of existing results for the kilonova (or macronova) emission from material ejected during a neutron-star (NS) merger is based on (quasi-)one-zone models or manually constructed toy-model ejecta configurations. In this study we present a kilonova analysis of the material ejected during the first 10ms of a NS merger, called dynamical ejecta, using directly the outflow trajectories from general relativistic smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations including a sophisticated neutrino treatment and the corresponding nucleosynthesis results, which have been presented in Part I of this study. We employ a multi-dimensional two-moment radiation transport scheme with approximate M1 closure to evolve the photon field and use a heuristic prescription for the opacities found by calibration with atomic-physics based reference results. We find that the photosphere is generically ellipsoidal but augmented with small-scale structure and produces emission that is about 1.5-3 times stronger towards the pole than the equator. The kilonova typically peaks after 0.7-1.5days in the near-infrared frequency regime with luminosities between [3-7x10^40erg/s] and at photospheric temperatures of [2.2-2.8x10^3K]. A softer equation of state or higher binary-mass asymmetry leads to a longer and brighter signal. Significant variations of the light curve are also obtained for models with artificially modified electron fractions, emphasizing the importance of a reliable neutrino-transport modeling. None of the models investigated here, which only consider dynamical ejecta, produces a transient as bright as AT2017gfo. The near-infrared peak of our models is incompatible with the early blue component of AT2017gfo.

title: GRB 160410A: the first Chemical Study of the Interstellar Medium of a Short GRB

topic: Short Gamma-Ray Bursts (SGRBs) are produced by the coalescence of compact binary systems which are remnants of massive stars. GRB 160410A is classified as a short-duration GRB with extended emission and is currently the farthest SGRB with a redshift determined from an afterglow spectrum and also one of the brightest SGRBs to date. The fast reaction to the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory alert allowed us to obtain a spectrum of the afterglow using the X-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The spectrum shows a number of absorption features at a redshift of z=1.7177, in addition, we detect two intervening systems at z=1.581 and z=1.444. The spectrum shows ly-alpha in absorption with a column density of log [N(HI)=21.3+/-0.3 cm-2] which, together with FeII, CII, SiII and OI, allow us to perform the first study of chemical abundances in a SGRB host galaxy. We determine a metallicity of [Fe/H=-2.7+/-0.3], significantly lower than observed for any long GRB host. We find no evidence for extinction in the afterglow spectral energy distribution (SED). The environment has a low degree of ionisation and the CIV and SiIV lines are completely absent. We do not detect an underlying host galaxy down to deep limits. Additionally, we present the spectrum of GRB 201221D, another high-z short GRB that shows absorption lines at z=1.045 but whose environment seems to be more similar to the one of short GRBs as derived from the SED fitting to the host photometry.

title: Unraveling the nature of GRBs progenitors through neutrinos
authors: G. Morales, N. Fraija
topic: GRBs are the most energetic electromagnetic events in the Universe. Those whose typical duration is longer than a few seconds are known as long GRBs and shorter than a few seconds are short GRBs. It is widely accepted that these events are associated with the collapse of a very massive star and the neutron star (NS) binary merger, respectively. A fast-spinning, strongly magnetized NS could be expected before a black hole (BH) in both scenarios. We allude to the thermal neutrinos' particular properties propagating inside the fireball for differentiating both scenarios in this work. We first derive the neutrino effective potential associated with each medium in a strong and weak magnetic field. We calculate the three-flavor oscillation probabilities, and finally, we get the expected neutrino rate in both scenarios. Given these observables' evolution, we can determine whether the progenitor could be associated with a strongly magnetized NS or a BH.

title: Bolometric light curves of aspherical shock breakout
authors: Christopher Irwin, Itai Linial, Ehud Nakar, Tsvi Piran, Re'em Sari
topic: The shock breakout emission is the first light that emerges from a supernova. In the spherical case it is characterized by a brief UV flash. In an axisymmetric, non-spherical prolate explosion, the shock first breaches the surface along the symmetry axis, then peels around to larger angles, producing a breakout light curve which may differ substantially from the spherically symmetric case. We study the emergence of a non-relativistic, bipolar shock from a spherical star, and estimate the basic properties of the associated bolometric shock breakout signal. We identify four possible classes of breakout light curves, depending on the degree of asphericity. Compared to spherical breakouts, we find that the main distinguishing features of significantly aspherical breakouts are 1) a longer and fainter initial breakout flash and 2) an extended phase of slowly-declining, or even rising, emission which is produced as ejecta flung out by the oblique breakout expand and cool. We find that the breakout flash has a maximum duration of roughly is the stellar radius and vbo is the velocity of the fastest-moving ejecta. For a standard Wolf--Rayet progenitor, the duration of the X-ray flash seen in SN 2008D exceeds this limit, and the same holds true for the prompt X-ray emission of low-luminosity GRBs such as GRB 060218. This suggests that these events cannot be explained by an aspherical explosion within a typical Wolf--Rayet star, implying that they originate from non-standard progenitors with larger breakout radii.

title: An equation-of-state-insensitive measure of neutron star stiffness
authors: Jayana Saes, Raissa F. P. Mendes
topic: Universal relations (i.e., insensitive to the equation of state) between macroscopic properties of neutron stars (NSs) have proven useful for a variety of applications -- from providing a direct means to extract observables from data to breaking degeneracies that hinder tests of general relativity. Similarly, equation-of-state insensitive relations directly connecting macroscopic and microscopic properties of NSs can potentially provide a clean window into the behavior of nuclear matter. In this Letter, we uncover a tight correlation between certain macroscopic properties of NSs -- its compactness, moment of inertia or tidal deformability -- and the ratio of central pressure to central energy density, which can be interpreted as a mean notion of the stiffness of nuclear matter inside a NS. We describe interesting properties of this stiffness measure, quantify its universality, and explore its consequences in the face of recent NS observations.

title: Constraining nuclear matter parameters and neutron star observables using PREX-2 and NICER data
authors: S. K. Biswal, H. C. Das, Ankit Kumar, S. K. Patra
topic: We try to constraints some of the nuclear matter parameters such as symmetry energy (J) and its slope (L) from the recent inferred data of the PREX-2. Other nuclear matter parameters are adopted from [paper] papers and the linear correlation among them are checked by using the Pearson's formula. We find the correlation between ... with coefficients 0.85, 0.81 and 0.76 respectively. The neutron star properties such as mass and radius are calculated with 50 unified equation of states. The results are consistent with recently observed pulsars and NICER data except few exceptions. From the radii constraints, we find that the new NICER data allows a narrow radius range contrary to a large range of PREX-2 and the old NICER data leaving us an inconclusive determination of the neutron star radius.

title: Nonlinear particle reacceleration by multiple shocks
authors: Thibault Vieu, Stefano Gabici, Vincent Tatischeff
topic: When the pressure of particles accelerated at shock waves is no longer negligible compared to the kinetic pressure of the gas, the linear theory of diffusive shock acceleration breaks down. This is expected in particular when the shock sweeps up preexisting cosmic rays, or when multiple shocks reaccelerate successively the same particles. To describe these systems, one has to account for the nonlinear backreaction of the particles on the magnetohydrodynamic flow. Using an up-to-date semi-analytical model of particle reacceleration at nonlinear shocks, we show that the presence of prexisting energetic particles strongly affects the shock profile, in such a way that the reacceleration of non thermal particles or the acceleration of particles from the thermal bath becomes less efficient. We further describe the evolution of the distribution of particles after several shocks and study the properties of the asymptotic solution. We detail the case of identical shocks as well as more realistic scenarios, including the heating of the medium or superbubble environments. When the particles are efficiently confined in the acceleration region, it is generally found that the spectrum converges toward a concave solution after a few tens of shocks, with a spectral index around 3.5 at the highest energy. The postshock cosmic ray pressure reaches an asymptotic value of about 4-5\% of the ram pressure of one shock. Most of the shock pressure is transferred to escaping particles.

A model is constructed for explaining accumulation of a large quantity of nuclear energy, which can maintain the X-ray luminosity of such compact objects for a long period of time. We studied numerically the dependence of the final chemical composition on various parameters of the model.

title: X-ray Flares Raising upon Magnetar Plateau as an Implication of a Surrounding Disk of Newborn Magnetized Neutron Star
authors: Tian-Ci Zheng, Long Li, Le Zou, Xiang-Gao Wang
topic: The X-ray flares have usually been ascribed to long-lasting activities of the central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), e.g., fallback accretion. The GRB X-ray plateaus, however, favor a millisecond magnetar central engine. The fallback accretion can be significantly suppressed due to the propeller effect of a magnetar. Therefore, if the propeller regime cannot resist the mass flow onto the surface of the magnetar efficiently, the X-ray flares raise upon the magnetar plateau would be hinted. In this work, such peculiar cases are connected to the accretion process of a magnetar, and an implication for magnetar-disc structure is given. We investigate the repeating accretion process with multi-flare GRB 050730, and give a discussion for the accreting induced variation of the magnetic field in GRB 111209A. Two or more flares exhibit in the GRB 050730, GRB 060607A, and GRB 140304A; by adopting magnetar mass M=1.4 Msun and radius R=12 km, the average mass flow rates of the corresponding surrounding disk are 3.53x10-4 Msun s-1, 4.23x10-4 Msun s-1, and 4.33x10-4 Mun s-1, and the corresponding average sizes of the magnetosphere are 5.01 x106cm, 6.45 x106cm, and 1.09 x107cm, respectively. A statistic analysis that contains 8 GRBs within 12 flares shows that the total mass loading in single flare is 2x10-5 Msun. In the lost mass of a disk, there are about 0.1\% used to feed a collimated jet.

title: Long-term evolution of neutron-star merger remnants in general relativistic resistive-magnetohydrodynamics with a mean-field dynamo term
authors: Masaru Shibata, Sho Fujibayashi, Yuichiro Sekiguchi
topic: Long-term neutrino-radiation resistive-magnetohydrodynamics simulations in full general relativity are performed for a system composed of a massive neutron star and a torus formed as a remnant of binary neutron star mergers. The simulation is performed in axial symmetry incorporating a mean-field dynamo term for a hypothetical amplification of the magnetic-field strength. We first calibrate the mean-field dynamo parameters by comparing the results for the evolution of black hole-disk systems with viscous hydrodynamics results. We then perform simulations for the system of a remnant massive neutron star and a torus. As in the viscous hydrodynamics case, the mass ejection occurs primarily from the torus surrounding the massive neutron star. The total ejecta mass and electron fraction in the new simulation are similar to those in the viscous hydrodynamics case. However, the velocity of the ejecta can be significantly enhanced by magnetohydrodynamics effects caused by global magnetic fields.

title: r-process nucleosynthesis from compact binary mergers
authors: Albino Perego, Friedrich-Karl Thielemann, Gabriele Cescutti
topic: The merger of two neutron stars or of a neutron star and a black hole often result in the ejection of a few percents of a solar mass of matter expanding at high speed in space. Being matter coming from the violent disruption of a neutron star, these ejecta are initially very dense, hot and extremely rich in neutrons. The few available protons form heavy nuclei (seeds) that absorb the more abundant free neutrons, increasing their size. The neutron density is so high that a substantial number of neutron captures occur before the resulting unstable nuclei can decay toward more stable configurations, converting neutrons into protons. Depending mostly on the initial neutron richness, this mechanism leads to the formation of up to half of the heavy elements that we observe in nature and it is called rapid neutron capture process (r-process). The prediction of the precise composition of the ejecta requires a detailed knowledge of the properties of very exotic nuclei, that have never been produced in a laboratory. Despite having long been a speculative scenario, nowadays several observational evidences point to compact binary mergers as one of the major sites where heavy elements are formed in the Universe. The most striking one was the detection of a kilonova following the merger of a neutron star binary: the light emitted by this astronomical transient is indeed powered by the radioactive decay of freshly synthesized neutron-rich nuclei and testifies the actual nature of compact binary mergers as cosmic forges.

title: Magnetically supramassive neutron stars
authors: Arthur G Suvorov, Kostas Glampedakis
topic: It is commonly believed that neutron stars exceeding the maximum mass limit for stability could be formed in the aftermath of binary neutron star mergers, enjoying a short life of metastability before losing centrifugal support and collapsing to a black hole. It is suggested here that a similar scenario could take place when the remnant's excess mass is supported by an ultra-strong [>10to17 G] magnetic field that could be generated during, and shortly after, coalescence. We show that such 'magnetically supramassive' neutron stars could stave off collapse and survive for a few years before their magnetic energy is sufficiently dissipated due to ambipolar diffusion. In addition, we speculate on multi-messenger signatures of such objects and discuss the robustness of our results against limitations placed by neutron superfluidity and magneto-thermal evolution

topic: We present the complete set of {\it Hubble Space Telescope} imaging of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its optical counterpart AT 2017gfo. Including deep template imaging in F814W, F110W, F140W, and F160W at 3.4 years post-merger, we re-analyze the full light curve of AT 2017gfo across 12 bands from 5--1273 rest-frame days after merger. We obtain four new detections of the short gamma-ray burst (GRB) 170817A afterglow from 109--170 rest-frame days post-merger. These detections are consistent with the previously observed beta=-0.6 spectral index in the afterglow light curve with no evidence for spectral evolution. We also analyze our limits in the case of novel late-time optical and IR emission signatures, such as a kilonova afterglow or infrared dust echo, but find our limits are not constraining in these contexts. We use the new data to construct deep optical and infrared stacks, reaching limits of M=-6.3 to -4.6 mag, to analyze the local environment around AT 2017gfo and low surface brightness features in its host galaxy NGC 4993. We rule out the presence of any globular cluster at the position of AT 2017gfo, including those with the reddest V-H colors. Finally, we analyze the substructure of NGC 4993 in deep residual imaging, and find shell features which extend up to 71.8\arcsec\ (14.2 kpc) from the center of the galaxy. We find that the shells have a cumulative stellar mass of roughly 2\% the total stellar mass of NGC 4993, and mass-weighted ages of [>3 Gyr]. We conclude that it was unlikely the GW170817 progenitor system formed in the galaxy merger, which based on dynamical signatures and the stellar population in the shells mostly likely occurred 220--685 Myr ago.

title: Revisiting the evolution of nonradiative supernova remnants: A hydrodynamical-informed parameterization of the shock positions
authors: R. Bandiera, N. Bucciantini, J. Martín, B. Olmi, D. F. Torres
topic: Understanding the evolution of a supernova remnant shell in time is fundamental. Such understanding is critical to build reliable models of the dynamics of the supernova remnant shell interaction with any pulsar wind nebula it might contain. Here, we perform a large study of the parameter space for the one-dimensional spherically symmetric evolution of a supernova remnant, accompanying it by analytical analysis. Assuming, as is usual, an ejecta density profile with a power-law core and an envelope, and a uniform ambient medium, we provide a set of highly-accurate approximations for the evolution of the main structural features of supernova remnants, such as the reverse and forward shocks and the contact discontinuity. We compare our results with previously adopted approximations, showing that existing simplified prescriptions can easily lead to large errors. In particular, in the context of pulsar wind nebulae modelling, an accurate description for the supernova remnant reverse shock is required. We also study in depth the self-similar solutions for the initial phase of evolution, when the reverse shock propagates through the envelope of the ejecta. Since these self-similar solutions are exact, but not fully analytical, we here provide highly-accurate approximations as well.

title: Ray-Tracing in Relativistic Jet Simulations: A Polarimetric Study of Magnetic Field Morphology and Electron Scaling Relations
authors: Joana A. Kramer, Nicholas R. MacDonald
topic: The jets emanating from the centers of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic objects in the universe. Investigating how the morphology of the jet's synchrotron emission depends on the magnetic nature of the jet's relativistic plasma is fundamental to the comparison between numerical simulations and the observed polarization of relativistic jets. Through the use of 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) jet simulations (computed using the PLUTO code) we study how the jet's synchrotron emission depends upon the morphology of the jet's magnetic field structure. Through the application of polarized radiative transfer and ray-tracing (via the RADMC-3D code) we create synthetic radio maps of the jet's total intensity as well as the linearly and circularly polarized intensity for each jet simulation. In particular, we create synthetic ray-traced images of the jet's polarized synchrotron emission when the jet carries a predominantly poloidal, helical, and toroidal magnetic field. We also explore several scaling relations in which the underlying electron power-law distribution is set proportional to: (i) the jet's thermal plasma density, (ii) the jet's internal energy density, and (iii) the jet's magnetic energy density. We find that: (i) the jet emission is edge brightened when the magnetic field is toroidal in nature and spine brightened when the magnetic field is poloidal in nature, (ii) the circularly polarized emission exhibits both negative and positive signs for the toroidal magnetic field morphology at an inclination of 45° as well as 5°, and (iii) the relativistic jet's emission is largely independent of different emission scaling relations when the ambient medium is excluded.

title: GRB Polarization: A Unique Probe of GRB Physics
authors: Ramandeep Gill, Merlin Kole, Jonathan Granot
topic: Over half a century from the discovery of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the dominant radiation mechanism responsible for their bright and highly variable prompt emission remains poorly understood. Spectral information alone has proven insufficient for understanding the composition and main energy dissipation mechanism in GRB jets. High-sensitivity polarimetric observations from upcoming instruments in this decade may help answer such key questions in GRB physics. This article reviews the current status of prompt GRB polarization measurements and provides comprehensive predictions from theoretical models. A concise overview of the fundamental questions in prompt GRB physics is provided. Important developments in gamma-ray polarimetry including a critical overview of different past instruments are presented. Theoretical predictions for different radiation mechanisms and jet structures are confronted with time-integrated and time-resolved measurements. The current status and capabilities of upcoming instruments regarding the prompt emission are presented. The very complimentary information that can be obtained from polarimetry of X-ray flares as well as reverse-shock and early to late forward-shock (afterglow) emission is highlighted. Finally, promising directions for overcoming the inherent difficulties in obtaining statistically significant prompt-GRB polarization measurements are discussed, along with prospects for improvements in the theoretical modeling, which may lead to significant advances in the field.

topic: The next two decades are expected to open the door to the first coincident detections of electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) signatures associated with massive black hole (MBH) binaries heading for coalescence. These detections will launch a new era of multimessenger astrophysics by expanding this growing field to the low-frequency GW regime and will provide unprecedented understanding of the evolution of MBHs and galaxies. They will also constitute fundamentally new probes of cosmology and would enable unique tests of gravity. The aim of this Living Review is to provide an introduction to this research topic by presenting a summary of key findings, physical processes and ideas pertaining to EM counterparts to MBH mergers as they are known at the time of this writing. We review current observational evidence for close MBH binaries, discuss relevant physical processes and timescales, and summarize the possible EM counterparts to GWs in the precursor, coalescence, and afterglow stages of a MBH merger. We also describe open questions and discuss future prospects in this dynamic and quick paced research area.

title: Pitch Angle Anisotropy Controls Particle Acceleration and Cooling in Radiative Relativistic Plasma Turbulence
authors: Luca Comisso, Lorenzo Sironi
topic: Nature's most powerful high-energy sources are capable of accelerating particles to high energy and radiate it away on extremely short timescales, even shorter than the light crossing time of the system. It is yet unclear what physical processes can produce such an efficient acceleration, despite the copious radiative losses. By means of radiative particle-in-cell simulations, we show that magnetically dominated turbulence in pair plasmas subject to strong synchrotron cooling generates a nonthermal particle spectrum with a hard power-law range (slope p=1) within a few eddy turnover times. Low pitch-angle particles can significantly exceed the nominal radiation-reaction limit, before abruptly cooling down. The particle spectrum becomes even harder [p<1] over time owing to particle cooling with an energy-dependent pitch-angle anisotropy. The resulting synchrotron spectrum is hard. Our findings have important implications for understanding the nonthermal emission from high-energy astrophysical sources, most notably the prompt phase of gamma-ray bursts and gamma-ray flares from the Crab nebula.

title: Dissipative Magnetohydrodynamics for Non-Resistive Relativistic Plasmas
authors: Elias R. Most, Jorge Noronha
topic: Based on a 14-moment closure for non-resistive (general-) relativistic viscous plasmas, we describe a new numerical scheme that is able to handle all first-order dissipative effects (heat conduction, bulk and shear viscosities), as well the anisotropies induced by the presence of magnetic fields. The latter is parameterized in terms of a thermal gyrofrequency or, equivalently, a thermal Larmor radius and allows to correctly capture the thermal Hall effect. By solving an extended Israel-Stewart-like system for the dissipative quantities that enforces algebraic constraints via stiff-relaxation, we are able to cast all first-order dissipative terms in flux-divergence form. This allows us to apply traditional high-resolution shock capturing methods to the equations, making the system suitable for the numerical study of highly turbulent flows. We present several numerical tests to assess the robustness of our numerical scheme in flat spacetime. The 14-moment closure can seamlessly interpolate between the highly collisional limit found in neutron star mergers, and the highly anisotropic limit of relativistic Braginskii magnetohydrodynamics appropriate for weakly collisional plasmas in black-hole accretion problems. We believe that this new formulation and numerical scheme will be useful for a broad class of relativistic magnetized flows.

title: Machine Learning for Conservative-to-Primitive in Relativistic Hydrodynamics
authors: Tobias Dieselhorst, William Cook, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, David Radice
topic: The numerical solution of relativistic hydrodynamics equations in conservative form requires root-finding algorithms that invert the conservative-to-primitive variables map. These algorithms employ the equation of state of the fluid and can be computationally demanding for applications involving sophisticated microphysics models. This work explores the use of machine learning methods to speed up the recovery of primitives in relativistic hydrodynamics. Artificial neural networks are trained to replace either the interpolations of a tabulated equation of state or directly the conservative-to-primitive map. The application of these neural networks to simple benchmark problems show that both approaches improve over traditional root finders with tabular equation-of-state and multi-dimensional interpolations. In particular, the neural networks for the conservative-to-primitive map accelerate the variable recovery by more than an order of magnitude over standard methods while maintaining accuracy. Neural networks are thus an interesting option to improve the speed and robustness of relativistic hydrodynamics algorithms.

title: What powers the radio emission in TDE AT2019dsg: a long-lived jet or
the disruption itself?
authors: Tatsuya Matsumoto, Tsvi Piran, Julian H. Krolik
topic: The tidal disruption event, AT2019dsg, was observed across a broad range of electromagnetic-wavelengths from radio to X-rays, and it was possibly accompanied by a high-energy neutrino. We study the nature of the radio-emitting outflow by analyzing the synchrotron self-absorbed spectra in terms of the equipartition model. We find that the time evolution of the outflow radius can be interpreted as either free expansion or deceleration. If the former, the outflow was launched 40 days before the optical peak; if the latter, the launch was 10 days after the optical peak. In addition, the energy in the radio-emitting region increases over time. This second conclusion is most naturally interpreted by a scenario resembling the earliest stage of a supernova remnant: as more and more material is swept up, it is heated by the forward shock at the expense of the outflow's kinetic energy. Energy injection from an accreting BH cannot be completely excluded, but the injection rate is very different from the fallback luminosity, requiring further physical explanation. If the neutrino association is real, the scale of energy injection needed is much greater than for the radio emission, suggesting that the detected neutrino did not arise from the radio emitting region.

title: Equation of state and composition of proto-neutron stars and merger remnants with hyperons
authors: Armen Sedrakian, Arus Harutyunyan
topic: Finite-temperature equation of state (EoS) and composition of dense nuclear and hypernuclear matter under conditions characteristic for neutron star binary merger remnants and supernovas are discussed. We consider both the neutrino free-streaming and the trapped regimes which are separated by a temperature of a few MeV. The formalism is based on covariant density functional (CDF) theory for the full baryon octet with density-dependent couplings, suitably adjusted in the hypernuclear sector. The softening of the EoS with the introduction of the hyperons is quantified under various conditions of lepton fractions and temperatures. We find that hyperons appear in the given order with the sharp density increase at zero temperature at the threshold being replaced by an extended increment over a wide density range at high temperatures. The Lambda hyperon survives in the deep subnuclear regime. The triplet of Sigmas is suppressed in cold hypernuclear matter up to around seven times the nuclear saturation density, but appears in significant fractions at higher temperatures [T>20] MeV in both supernova and merger remnant matter. We point out that there exists a special isospin degeneracy point where the baryon abundances within each of the three isospin-multiplets are equal to each other as a result of (approximate) isospin symmetry. At that point the charge chemical potential of the system vanishes. We find that under the merger remnant conditions the fractions of electron and μ-on neutrinos are close and are about 1\%, whereas in the supernova case, we find only a significant fraction (10\%) of electron neutrinos, given that in this case, the μ-on lepton number is zero.

title: Dynamical ejecta of neutron star mergers with nucleonic weak processes I: Nucleosynthesis
authors: I. Kullmann, S. Goriely, O. Just, R. Ardevol-Pulpillo, A. Bauswein, H.-T. Janka
topic: We present a coherent study of the impact of neutrino interactions on the r-process element nucleosynthesis and the heating rate produced by the radioactive elements synthesised in the dynamical ejecta of neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) mergers. We have studied the material ejected from four NS-NS merger systems based on the hydrodynamical simulations of Ardevol-Pulpillo et al. (2019) which handle neutrino effects in an elaborate way by including neutrino equilibration with matter in optically thick regions and re-absorption in optically thin regions. We find that the neutron richness of the dynamical ejecta is significantly affected by the neutrinos emitted by the post-merger remnant, in particular when compared to a case neglecting all neutrino interactions. Our nucleosynthesis results show that a solar-like distribution of r-process elements with mass numbers [A>90] is produced, including a significant enrichment in Sr and a reduced production of actinides compared to simulations without inclusion of the nucleonic weak processes. The composition of the ejected matter as well as the corresponding rate of radioactive decay heating are found to be rather independent of the system mass asymmetry and the adopted equation of state. This approximate degeneracy in abundance pattern and heating rates can be favourable for extracting the ejecta properties from kilonova observations. Part II of this work will study the light curve produced by the dynamical ejecta of our four NS merger models.

topic: A core-collapse supernova occurs when exothermic fusion ceases in the core of a massive star, typically due to exhaustion of nuclear fuel. Theory predicts that fusion could be interrupted earlier, by merging of the star with a compact binary companion. We report a luminous radio transient, VT J121001+495647, found in the Very Large Array Sky Survey. The radio emission is consistent with supernova ejecta colliding with a dense shell of material, potentially ejected by binary interaction in the centuries prior to explosion. We associate the supernova with an archival X-ray transient, which implies a relativistic jet was launched during the explosion. The combination of an early relativistic jet and late-time dense interaction is consistent with expectations for a merger-driven explosion.

title: Segmentation of turbulent computational fluid dynamics simulations with unsupervised ensemble learning
authors: Maarja Bussov, Joonas Nättilä
topic: Computer vision and machine learning tools offer an exciting new way for automatically analyzing and categorizing information from complex computer simulations. Here we design an ensemble machine learning framework that can independently and robustly categorize and dissect simulation data output contents of turbulent flow patterns into distinct structure catalogues. The segmentation is performed using an unsupervised clustering algorithm, which segments physical structures by grouping together similar pixels in simulation images. The accuracy and robustness of the resulting segment region boundaries are enhanced by combining information from multiple simultaneously-evaluated clustering operations. The stacking of object segmentation evaluations is performed using image mask combination operations. This statistically-combined ensemble (SCE) of different cluster masks allows us to construct cluster reliability metrics for each pixel and for the associated segments without any prior user input. By comparing the similarity of different cluster occurrences in the ensemble, we can also assess the optimal number of clusters needed to describe the data. Furthermore, by relying on ensemble-averaged spatial segment region boundaries, the SCE method enables reconstruction of more accurate and robust region of interest (ROI) boundaries for the different image data clusters. We apply the SCE algorithm to 2-dimensional simulation data snapshots of magnetically-dominated fully-kinetic turbulent plasma flows where accurate ROI boundaries are needed for geometrical measurements of intermittent flow structures known as current sheets.

title: Mini-disk accretion onto spinning black hole binaries: quasi-periodicities and outflows
authors: Luciano Combi, Federico G Lopez Armengol, Manuela Campanelli, Scott C. Noble, Mark Avara, Julian H. Krolik, Dennis Bowen
topic: We perform a full 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulation of an equal-mass, spinning, binary black hole approaching merger, surrounded by a circumbinary disk and with a mini-disk around each black hole. For this purpose, we evolve the ideal GRMHD equations on top of an approximated spacetime for the binary that is valid in every position of space, including the black hole horizons, during the inspiral regime. We use relaxed initial data for the circumbinary disk from a previous long-term simulation, where the accretion is dominated by a m=1 overdensity called the lump. We compare our new spinning simulation with a previous non-spinning run, studying how spin influences the mini-disk properties. We analyze the accretion from the inner edge of the lump to the black hole, focusing on the angular momentum budget of the fluid around the mini-disks. We find that mini-disks in the spinning case have more mass over a cycle than the non-spinning case. However, in both cases, we find most of the mass received by the black holes is delivered by the direct plunging of material from the lump. We also analyze the morphology and variability of the electromagnetic fluxes and we find they share the same periodicities of the accretion rate. In the spinning case, we find that the outflows are 8 times stronger than the non-spinning case. Our results will be useful to understand and produce realistic synthetic light curves and spectra, which can be used in future observations.

title: Radiative MHD Simulations of Photon Bubbles in Radiation-Supported Magnetized Atmospheres of Neutron Stars with Isotropic Thomson Scattering
authors: Lizhong Zhang, Omer Blaes, Yan-Fei Jiang
topic: A major uncertainty in the structure and dynamics of magnetized, radiation pressure dominated neutron star accretion columns in X-ray pulsars and pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources is that they are thought to be subject to the photon bubble instability. We present the results of two dimensional radiation relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a non-accreting, static atmosphere to study the development of this instability assuming isotropic Thomson scattering in the slow diffusion regime that is relevant to neutron star accretion columns. Photon bubbles generally grow faster toward shorter wavelengths, until a maximum growth rate is achieved at the radiation viscosity length scale, which is generally quite small and requires high numerical resolution to simulate. We confirm the consistency between our simulation results and linear theory in detail, and show that the nonlinear evolution inevitably leads to collapse of the atmosphere with the higher resolution simulation collapsing faster due to the presence of shorter length scale nonlinear structures. At least in static atmospheres with horizontally periodic boundary conditions, this resolution dependence may make simulations of the nonlinear dynamics of photon bubble instability in neutron star accretion columns challenging. It remains to be seen whether these difficulties will persist upon inclusion of an accretion flow through the top and magnetically-confined horizontal boundaries through which photons can escape. Our results here provide a foundation for such future work.

title: High-Order Multipole and Binary Love Number Universal Relations
authors: Daniel A. Godzieba, David Radice
topic: Using a data set of approximately 2 million phenomenological equations of state consistent with observational constraints, we construct new equation-of-state-insensitive universal relations that exist between the multipolar tidal deformability parameters of neutron stars, for several high-order multipoles (l=5,6,7,8). We confirm the existence of a universal relation between the radius of the 1.4M NS, R1.4 and the reduced tidal parameter of the binary, and the chirp mass. We extend this relation to a large number of chirp masses and to the radii of isolated NSs of different mass M, RM. We find that there is an optimal value of M for every such that the uncertainty in the estimate of RM is minimized when using the relation. We discuss the utility and implications of these relations for the upcoming LIGO O4 run and third-generation detectors.

title: Inclination estimates from off-axis GRB afterglow modelling
authors: Gavin P Lamb, Joseph J Fernández, Fergus Hayes, Albert K H Kong, En-Tzu Lin, Nial R Tanvir, Martin Hendry, Ik Siong Heng, Surojit Saha, John Veitch
topic: For gravitational wave (GW) detected neutron star mergers, one of the leading candidates for electromagnetic (EM) counterparts is the afterglow from an ultra-relativistic jet. Where this afterglow is observed, it will likely be viewed off-axis, such as the afterglow following GW170817/GRB 170817A. The temporal behaviour of an off-axis observed GRB afterglow can be used to reveal the lateral jet structure, and statistical model fits can put constraints on the various model free-parameters. Amongst these parameters is the inclination of the system to the line of sight. Along with the GW detection, the afterglow modelling provides the best constraint on the inclination to the line-of-sight and can improve the estimates of cosmological parameters e.g. the Hubble constant, from GW-EM events. However, modelling of the afterglow depends on the assumed jet structure and, often overlooked, the effects of lateral spreading. Here we show how the inclusion of lateral spreading in the afterglow models can affect the estimated inclination of GW-EM events.

title: EoS for hot neutron stars
authors: Adriana R. Raduta, Flavia Nacu, Micaela Oertel
topic: We review the equation of state (EoS) models covering a large range of temperatures, baryon number densities and electron fractions presently available on the \textsc{CompOSE} database. These models are intended to be directly usable within numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae, binary neutron star mergers and proto-neutron star evolution. We discuss their compliance with existing constraints from astrophysical observations and nuclear data. For a selection of purely nucleonic models in reasonable agreement with the above constraints, after discussing the properties of cold matter, we review thermal properties for thermodynamic conditions relevant for core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. We find that the latter are strongly influenced by the density dependence of the nucleon effective mass. The selected bunch of models is used to investigate the EoS dependence of hot star properties, where entropy per baryon and electron fraction profiles are inspired from proto-neutron star evolution. The Gamma-law analytical thermal EoS used in many simulations is found not to describe well these thermal properties of the EoS. However, it may offer a fair description of the structure of hot stars whenever thermal effects on the baryonic part are small, as shown here for proto-neutron stars starting from several seconds after bounce.

title: Are Interactions with Neutron Star Merger Winds Shaping the Jets?
authors: Lorenzo Nativi (1), Gavin P. Lamb (2), Stephan Rosswog (1), Christoffer Lundman (1), Grzegorz Kowal 
topic: Jets can become collimated as they propagate through dense environments and understanding such interactions is crucial for linking physical models of the environments to observations. In this work, we use 3D special-relativistic simulations to study how jets propagate through the environment created around a neutron star merger remnant by neutrino-driven winds. We simulate four jets with two different initial structures, top-hat and Gaussian, and two luminosities. After jet breakout, we study the angular jet structures and the resulting afterglow light curves. We find that the initial angular structures are efficiently washed out during the propagation, despite the small wind mass of only 10-3Msun. The final structures depend, however, on the jet luminosity, as less energetic jets are more strongly collimated. Although entrainment of baryons leads to only moderate outflow Lorentz factors (40), all simulated jets can well reproduce the afterglow observed in the aftermath of GW170817. The inferred physical parameters (e.g. inclination angle, ambient particle number density), however, vary substantially between the fits and appear to be sensitive to smaller details of the angular jet shape, indicating that observationally inferred parameters may depend sensitively on the employed jet models.

title: Estimating outflow masses and velocities in merger simulations: impact of r-process heating and neutrino cooling
authors: Francois Foucart, Philipp Moesta, Teresita Ramirez, Alex James Wright, Siva Darbha, Daniel Kasen
topic: The determination of the mass, composition, and geometry of matter outflows in black hole-neutron star and neutron star-neutron star binaries is crucial to current efforts to model kilonovae, and to understand the role of neutron star merger in r-process nucleosynthesis. In this manuscript, we review the simple criteria currently used in merger simulations to determine whether matter is unbound and what the asymptotic velocity of ejected material will be. We then show that properly accounting for both heating and cooling during r-process nucleosynthesis is important to accurately predict the mass and kinetic energy of the outflows. We also derive a model accounting for both of these effects that can be easily implemented in merger simulations. We show, however, that the detailed velocity distribution and geometry of the outflows can currently only be captured by full 3D fluid simulations of the outflows, as non-local effect ignored by the simple criteria used in merger simulations cannot be safely neglected when modeling these effects. Finally, we propose the introduction of simple source terms in the fluid equations to approximately account for heating/cooling from r-process nucleosynthesis in future seconds-long 3D simulations of merger remnants, without the explicit inclusion of out-of-nuclear statistical equilibrium reactions in the simulations.

title: Relativistic hybrid stars in the light of NICER PSR J0740+6620 radius measurement
authors: Jia Jie Li, Armen Sedrakian, Mark Alford
topic: We explored the implications of the recent radius determination of PSR J0740+6620 by the NICER experiment combined with the neutron skin measurement by PREX-II experiment for the structure of hybrid stars with a strong first-order phase transition from nucleonic to quark matter. We combine a covariant density-functional nucleonic equation of state (EoS) with a constant speed of sound EoS for quark matter. We show that the radius and tidal deformability ranges obtained from GW170817 can be reconciled with the PREX-II results if there is a phase transition to quark matter in the low-mass compact star. In the high-mass segment, the EoS needs to be stiff to comply with the large-radius inference for PSR J0740+6620 and J0030+0451 with a masses M≃2Msun and M=1.4Msun. We show that twin stars are not excluded, but the mass and radius ranges (with M\geq Msun) are restricted to narrow domains Delta Mtwin \leq 0.05Msun and DeltaRtwin sim 1.0 km. We also show that the existence of twin configurations is compatible with the light companion in GW190814 event being a hybrid star in the case of values of the sound-speed square s=0.6.

authors: Debarati Chatterjee, Jerome Novak, Micaela Oertel
topic: In this review we discuss self-consistent methods to calculate the global structure of strongly magnetised neutron stars within the general-relativistic framework. We outline why solutions in spherical symmetry cannot be applied to strongly magnetised compact stars, and elaborate on a consistent formalism to compute rotating magnetised neutron star models. We also discuss an application of the above full numerical solution for studying the influence of strong magnetic fields on the radius and crust thickness of magnetars. The above technique is also applied to construct a "universal" magnetic field profile inside the neutron star, that may be useful for studies in nuclear physics. The methodology developed here is particularly useful to interpret multi-messenger astrophysical data of strongly magnetised neutron stars.

title: Exponential Integrators for MHD: Matrix-free Leja interpolation and efficient adaptive time stepping
authors: Pranab Deka, Lukas Einkemmer
topic: We propose a novel algorithm for the temporal integration of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The approach is based on exponential Rosenbrock schemes in combination with Leja interpolation. It naturally preserves Gauss's law for magnetism and is unencumbered by the stability constraints observed for explicit methods. Remarkable progress has been achieved in designing exponential integrators and computing the required matrix functions efficiently. However, employing them in realistic MHD scenarios require matrix-free implementations that are competent on modern computer hardware. We show how an efficient algorithm based on Leja interpolation that only uses the right-hand side of the differential equation (i.e. matrix-free), can be constructed. We further demonstrate that it outperforms, in the context of magnetic reconnection and the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability, earlier work on Krylov-based exponential integrators as well as explicit methods. Furthermore, an adaptive step size strategy is employed that gives an excellent and predictable performance, particularly in the lenient to intermediate tolerance regime that is often of importance in practical applications.

title: Magnetorotational core collapse of possible GRB progenitors. IV. A wider range of progenitors
authors: M. Obergaulinger, M.Á. Aloy (U València)
topic: The final collapse of the cores of massive stars can lead to a wide variety of outcomes in terms of electromagnetic and kinetic energies, nucleosynthesis, and remnants. While exists the connection of this wide spectrum of explosion and remnant types to the properties H of the progenitors remains an open issue, rotation and magnetic fields in Wolf-Rayet stars of subsolar metallicity have been suggested as explanations for extreme events such as superluminous supernovae and gamma-ray bursts powered by proto-magnetars or collapsars. Continuing numerical studies of magnetorotational core collapse including detailed neutrino physics, we focus on progenitors with zero-age main-sequence masses in the range between 5 and 39 solar masses. All of the pre-collapse stars were calculated in spherical symmetry employing prescriptions for the effects of rotation and magnetic fields, with eight of the ten stars we consider being the results of chemically homogeneous evolution due to enhanced rotational mixing (Aguilera-Dena et al. 2018). All but one of them produce explosions driven by neutrino heating (more likely for low mass progenitors up to 8 solar masses) and non-spherical flows or by magnetorotational stresses (more frequent above 26 solar masses). In most of them and for the one non-exploding model, ongoing accretion leads to black-hole formation. Rapid rotation makes a subsequent collapsar activity plausible. If no black hole is formed, proto-magnetar driven jets can be expected and are, in fact, found in the simulations. Conditions for the formation of nickel are more favourable in magnetorotationally driven models, though our rough estimates fall short of the requirements for extremely bright events.

title: Discrete implicit Monte-Carlo (DIMC) scheme for simulating radiative transfer problems
authors: Elad Steinberg, Shay I. Heizler
topic: We present a new algorithm for radiative transfer, based on a statistical Monte-Carlo approach, that does not suffer from teleportation effects on the one hand, and yields smooth results on the other hand. Implicit-Monte-Carlo (IMC) techniques for modeling radiative transfer exist from the 70's. However, in optically thick problems, the basic algorithm suffers from "teleportation" errors, where the photons propagate faster than the exact physical behavior, due to the absorption-black body emission processes. One possible solution is to use semi-analog Monte-Carlo, in its new implicit form (ISMC), that uses two kinds of particles, photons and discrete material particles. This algorithm yields excellent teleportation-free results, however, it also results with nosier solutions (relative to classic IMC) due to its discrete nature. Here, we derive a new Monte-Carlo algorithm, Discrete implicit Monte-Carlo (DIMC) that uses the idea of the two-kind discrete particles and thus, does not suffer from teleportation errors. DIMC implements the IMC discretization and creates new radiation photons each time step, unlike ISMC. This yields smooth results as classic IMC, due to the continuous absorption technique. One of the main parts of the algorithm is the avoidance of population explosion of particles, using particle merging. We test the new algorithm in both one and two-dimensional cylindrical problems, and show that it yields smooth, teleportation-free results. We finish in demonstrating the power of the new algorithm in a classic radiative hydrodynamic problem, an opaque radiative shock wave. This demonstrates the power of the new algorithm in astrophysical scenarios.

title: Jets in Magnetically Arrested Hot Accretion Flows: Geometry, Power and Black Hole Spindown
authors: Ramesh Narayan, Andrew Chael, Koushik Chatterjee, Angelo Ricarte, Brandon Curd
topic: We present the results of nine simulations of radiatively-inefficient magnetically arrested disks (MADs) across different values of the black hole spin parameter a: -0.9, -0.7, -0.5, -0.3, 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9. Each simulation was run up to t\geq100,000 GM/c3 to ensure disk inflow equilibrium out to large radii. We find that the saturated magnetic flux level, and consequently also jet power, of MAD disks depends strongly on the black hole spin, confirming the results of Tchekhovskoy et al. (2012). Prograde disks saturate at a much higher relative magnetic flux and have more powerful jets than their retrograde counterparts. MADs with spinning black holes naturally launch jets with generalized parabolic profiles with width varying as a power of distance from the black hole. For distances up to 100GM/c2, the power-law index is k=0.27-0.42. There is a strong correlation between the disk-jet geometry and the dimensionless magnetic flux, resulting in prograde systems displaying thinner equatorial accretion flows near the black hole and wider jets, compared to retrograde systems. Prograde and retrograde MADs also exhibit different trends in disk variability: accretion rate variability increases with increasing spin for a\g0 and remains almost constant for a\leq0, while magnetic flux variability shows the opposite trend. Jets in the MAD state remove more angular momentum from black holes than is accreted, effectively spinning down the black hole. If powerful jets from MAD systems in Nature are persistent, this loss of angular momentum will notably reduce the black hole spin over cosmic time.

topic: Accreting black holes are sources of major interest in astronomy, particular those launching jets because of their ability to accelerate particles, and dramatically affect their surrounding environment up to very large distances. The spatial, energy and time scales at which a central active black hole radiates and impacts its environment depend on its mass. The implied scale-invariance of accretion/ejection physics between black hole systems of different central masses has been confirmed by several studies. Therefore, designing a self-consistent theoretical model that can describe such systems, regardless of their mass, is of crucial importance to tackle a variety of astrophysical sources. We present here a new and significantly improved version of a scale invariant, steady-state, multi-zone jet model, which we rename bhjet, resulting from the efforts of our group to advance the modelling of black hole systems. We summarise the model assumptions and basic equations, how they have evolved over time, and the additional features that we have recently introduced. These include additional input electron populations, the extension to cyclotron emission in near-relativistic regime, an improved multiple inverse Compton scattering method, external photon seeds typical of AGN and a magnetically-dominated jet dynamical model as opposed to the pressure-driven jet configuration present in older versions. In this paper, we publicly release the code on Github and, in order to facilitate the user's approach to its many possibilities, showcase a few applications as a tutorial.

title: Quantized electrical conductivity in binary neutron star mergers
authors: Sreemoyee Sarkar, Souvik Priyam Adhya
topic: We examine nature of longitudinal electrical conductivity in magnetized electron-ion plasma in the context of binary neutron star mergers. In presence of strong magnetic field, high density and temperature, quantum oscillatory behaviour for electrons emerge due to breakdown of the classical description. For pronounced thermodynamic effects, we consider zeroth Landau level population of electrons for electrical conductivity. We solve Boltzmann equation in presence of magnetic field to obtain the dissipative component of the conductivity. The conductivity is formulated considering dynamically scattering centres in the medium with magnetically modified screening. Numerical estimations show that the effect of magnetically modified screening mass on electrical conductivity is less. On the other hand, we observe that frequency dependent screening reduces electrical conductivity leading to a reduction in the Ohmic decay time scale to become of the order of the characteristic timescale of the merger process in the low density regime. This indicates the relevance of dissipative process for the merger simulation in the above mentioned domain.

title: Long-term GRHMD simulation of magnetic field in isolated neutron stars
authors: Ankan Sur, William Cook, David Radice, Brynmor Haskell, Sebastiano Bernuzzi
topic: Strong magnetic fields play an important role in powering the emission of neutron stars. Nevertheless a full understanding of the interior configuration of the field remains elusive. In this work, we present General Relativistic MagnetoHydroDynamics simulations of the magnetic field evolution in neutron stars lasting 500 ms (5 Alfven crossing times) and up to resolutions of 0.231 km using Athena++. We explore two different initial conditions, one with purely poloidal magnetic field and the other with a dominant toroidal component, and study the poloidal and toroidal field energies, the growth times of the various instability-driven oscillation modes and turbulence. We find that the purely poloidal setup generates a toroidal field which later decays exponentially reaching 1% of the total magnetic energy, showing no evidence of reaching equilibrium. The initially stronger toroidal field setup, on the other hand, loses up to 20% of toroidal energy and maintains this state till the end of our simulation. We also explore the hypothesis, drawn from previous MHD simulations, that turbulence plays an important role in the quasi equilibrium state. An analysis of the spectra in our higher resolution setups reveal, however, that in most cases we are not observing turbulence at small scales, but rather a noisy velocity field inside the star. We also observe that the majority of the magnetic energy gets dissipated as heat increasing the internal energy of the star, while a small fraction gets radiated away as electromagnetic radiation.

title: Photospheric Prompt Emission From Long Gamma Ray Burst Simulations -- II. Spectropolarimetry
authors: Tyler Parsotan, Davide Lazzati
topic: Although Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) have been detected for many decades, the lack of knowledge regarding the radiation mechanism that produces the energetic flash of radiation, or prompt emission, from these events has prevented the full use of GRBs as probes of high energy astrophysical processes. While there are multiple models that attempt to describe the prompt emission, each model can be tuned to account for observed GRB characteristics in the gamma and X-ray energy bands. One energy range that has not been fully explored for the purpose of prompt emission model comparison is that of the optical band, especially with regards to polarization. Here, we use an improved MCRaT code to calculate the expected photospheric optical and gamma-ray polarization signatures (1st and 2nd, respectively) from a set of two relativistic hydrodynamic long GRB simulations, which emulate a constant and variable jet. We find that time resolved 1st can be large (75%) while time-integrated 1st can be smaller due to integration over the asymmetries in the GRB jet where optical photons originate; 2nd follows a similar evolution as 1st with smaller polarization degrees. We also show that 1st and 2nd agree well with observations in each energy range. Additionally, we make predictions for the expected polarization of GRBs based on their location within the Yonetoku relationship. While improvements can be made to our analyses and predictions, they exhibit the insight that global radiative transfer simulations of GRB jets can provide with respect to current and future observations.

title: Radio Emission from Outflow-Cloud Interaction and Its Constraint on TDE Outflow
authors: Guobin Mou, Tinggui Wang, Wei Wang, Jingjing Yang
topic: Tidal disruption event (TDE) can launch an ultrafast outflow. If the black hole is surrounded by large amounts of clouds, outflow-cloud interaction will generate bow shocks, accelerate electrons and produce radio emission. Here we investigate the interaction between a non-relativistic outflow and clouds in active galaxies, which is manifested as outflow-BLR (broad line region) interaction, and can be extended to outflow-torus interaction. This process can generate considerable radio emission, which may account for the radio flares appearing a few months later after TDE outbursts. Radio observations can be used to directly constrain the physics of outflow, instead of indirectly providing a lower limit of the outflow energy by estimating the electron and magnetic field energy as in the outflow-CNM (circumnuclear medium) model. Benefitting from efficient energy conversion from outflow to shocks and the strong magnetic field, outflow-cloud interaction may play a non-negligible, or even dominating role in generating radio flares in a cloudy circumnuclear environment if the CNM density is no more than 100 times the Sgr A-like one.

title: High-accuracy simulations of highly spinning binary neutron star systems
authors: Reetika Dudi, Tim Dietrich, Alireza Rashti, Bernd Bruegmann, Jan Steinhoff, Wolfgang Tichy
topic: With an increasing number of expected gravitational-wave detections of binary neutron star mergers, it is essential that gravitational-wave models employed for the analysis of observational data are able to describe generic compact binary systems. This includes systems in which the individual neutron stars are millisecond pulsars for which spin effects become essential. In this work, we perform numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron stars with aligned and anti-aligned spins within a range of dimensionless spins of \chi-[-0.28,0.58]. The simulations are performed with multiple resolutions, show a clear convergence order and, consequently, can be used to test existing waveform approximants. We find that for very high spins gravitational-wave models that have been employed for the interpretation of GW170817 and GW190425 are not capable of describing our numerical-relativity dataset. We verify through a full parameter estimation study in which clear biases in the estimate of the tidal deformability and effective spin are present. We hope that in preparation of the next gravitational-wave observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors our new set of numerical-relativity data can be used to support future developments of new gravitational-wave models.

topic: We investigate the evolution of the afterglow produced by the deceleration of the non-relativistic material due to its surroundings. The ejecta mass is launched into the circumstellar medium with equivalent kinetic energy expressed as a power-law velocity distribution [E\prop(Gamma beta)\sim\alpha]. The density profile of this medium follows a power law [n(r)\prop r^-k] with k the stratification parameter, which accounts for the usual cases of a constant medium (k=0) and a wind-like medium (k=2). A long-lasting central engine, which injects energy into the ejected material as [E\prop t1-q] was also assumed. With our model, we show the predicted light curves associated with this emission for different sets of initial conditions and notice the effect of the variation of these parameters on the frequencies, timescales and intensities. The results are discussed in the Kilonova scenario.

The discussion highlights the connection between the microphysics (associated with a given equation of state) and the global dynamics (from the point of view of numerical simulations), and includes a careful consideration of the assumptions that lead to ideal and resistive magnetohydrodynamics. We pay particular attention to the issue of local charge neutrality, which tends to be assumed but appears to be more involved than is generally appreciated. While we do not resolve all the involved issues, we highlight how some of the assumptions and simplifications may be tested by simulations. The final formulation is consistent, both logically and physically, preparing the ground for a new generation of models of relevant astrophysical scenarios.

title: Thermal aspects of neutron star mergers
authors: Peter Hammond, Ian Hawke, Nils Andersson
topic: In order to extract maximal information from neutron-star merger signals, both gravitational and electromagnetic, we need to ensure that our theoretical models/numerical simulations faithfully represent the extreme physics involved. This involves a range of issues, with the finite temperature effects regulating many of the relevant phenomena. As a step towards understanding these issues, we explore the conditions for beta-equilibrium in neutron star matter for the densities and temperatures reached in a binary neutron star merger. Using the results from our out-of-equilibrium merger simulation, we consider how different notions of equilibrium may affect the merger dynamics, raising issues that arise when attempting to account for these conditions in future simulations. These issues are both computational and conceptual. We show that the effects lead to, in our case, a softening of the equation of state in some density regions, and to composition changes that affect processes that rely on deviation from equilibrium, such as bulk viscosity, both in terms of the magnitude and the equilibration timescales inherent to the relevant set of reactions. We also demonstrate that it is difficult to determine exactly which equilibrium conditions are relevant in which regions of the matter due to the dependence on neutrino absorption, further complicating the calculation of the reactions that work to restore the matter to equilibrium.

title: Neutron Star−Neutron Star and Neutron Star−Black Hole Mergers: Multiband Observations and Early Warnings
authors: Chang Liu, Lijing Shao
topic: The detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star (BNS) systems and neutron star--black hole (NSBH) systems provide new insights into dense matter properties in extreme conditions and associated high-energy astrophysical processes. However, currently information about NS equation of state (EoS) is extracted with very limited precision. Meanwhile, the fruitful results from the serendipitous discovery of the gamma-ray burst alongside GW170817 show the necessity of early warning alerts. Accurate measurements of the matter effects and sky location could be achieved by joint GW detection from space and ground. In our work, based on two example cases, GW170817 and GW200105, we use the Fisher information matrix analysis to investigate the multiband synergy between the space-borne decihertz GW detectors and the ground-based Einstein Telescope (ET). We specially focus on the parameters pertaining to spin-induced quadrupole moment, tidal deformability, and sky localization. We demonstrate that, (i) only with the help of multiband observations can we constrain the quadrupole parameter; and (ii) with the inclusion of decihertz GW detectors, the errors of tidal deformability would be a few times smaller, indicating that many more EoSs could be excluded; (iii) with the inclusion of ET, the sky localization improves by about an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we have systematically compared the different limits from four planned decihertz detectors and adopting two widely used waveform models.

title: Resolving the fastest ejecta from binary Neutron Star mergers: implications for electromagnetic counterparts
authors: Coleman Dean, Rodrigo Fernández, Brian D. Metzger
topic: We examine the effect of spatial resolution on initial mass ejection in grid-based hydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers. The subset of the dynamical ejecta with velocities greater than 0.6c can generate an ultraviolet precursor to the kilonova on hr timescales and contribute to a years-long non-thermal afterglow. Previous work has found differing amounts of this fast ejecta, by one- to two orders of magnitude, when using particle-based or grid-based hydrodynamic methods. Here we carry out a numerical experiment that models the merger as an axisymmetric collision in a co-rotating frame, accounting for Newtonian self-gravity, inertial forces, and gravitational wave losses. The lower computational cost allows us to reach spatial resolutions as high as 4m, or 3x10-4 of the stellar radius. We find that fast ejecta production converges to within 10\% for a cell size of 20m. This suggests that fast ejecta quantities found in existing grid-based merger simulations are unlikely to increase to the level needed to match particle-based results upon further resolution increases. The resulting neutron-powered precursors are in principle detectable out to distances \ll 200Mpc with upcoming facilities. We also find that head-on collisions at the free-fall speed, relevant for eccentric mergers, yield fast and slow ejecta quantities of order, with a kilonova signature distinct from that of quasi-circular mergers.

title: Cyclotron line formation by reflection on the surface of a magnetic neutron star
authors: N. D. Kylafis, J. E. Trümper, N. A. Loudas
topic: Accretion onto magnetic neutron stars results in X-ray spectra that often exhibit a cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) and, sometimes, higher harmonics of it. Two places are suspect for the formation of a CRSF: the surface of the neutron star and the radiative shock in the accretion column. Here we explore the first possibility: reflection at the neutron-star surface of the continuum produced at the radiative shock. It has been proposed that for high-luminosity sources, as the luminosity increases, the height of the radiative shock increases, thus a larger polar area is illuminated, and as a consequence the energy of the CRSF decreases because the dipole magnetic field decreases by a factor of two from the pole to the equator. We used a Monte Carlo code to compute the reflected spectrum from the atmosphere of a magnetic neutron star, when the incident spectrum is a power-law one. We restricted ourselves to cyclotron energies \ll mec2 and used polarization-dependent scattering cross sections, allowing for polarization mode change. As expected, a prominent CRSF is produced in the reflected spectra if the incident photons are in a pencil beam, which hits the neutron-star surface at a point with a well-defined magnetic field strength. However, the incident beam from the radiative shock has a finite width and thus various magnetic field strengths are sampled. As a result of overlap, the reflected spectra have a CRSF, which is close to that produced at the magnetic pole, independent of the height of the radiative shock. Reflection at the surface of a magnetic neutron star cannot explain the observed decrease in the CRSF energy with luminosity in the high-luminosity X-ray pulsar V 0332+53.

title: An Archival Search for Very-High-Energy Counterparts to Sub-Threshold Neutron-Star Merger Candidates
authors: Colin Adams, Imre Bartos, K. Rainer Corley, Szabolcs Márka, Zsuzsanna Márka, Doğa Veske
topic: The recent discovery of electromagnetic signals in coincidence with gravitational waves from neutron-star mergers has solidified the importance of multimessenger campaigns for studying the most energetic astrophysical events. Pioneering multimessenger observatories, such as the LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave detectors and the IceCube neutrino observatory, record many candidate signals that fall short of the detection significance threshold. These sub-threshold event candidates are promising targets for multimessenger studies, as the information provided by these candidates may, when combined with time-coincident gamma-ray observations, lead to significant detections. In this contribution, I describe our use of sub-threshold binary neutron star merger candidates identified in Advanced LIGO's first observing run (O1) to search for transient events in very-high-energy gamma rays using archival observations from the VERITAS imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array. I describe the promise of this technique for future joint sub-threshold searches.

authors: Polina Petrov, Leo P. Singer, Michael W. Coughlin, Vishwesh Kumar, Mouza Almualla, Shreya Anand, Mattia Bulla, Tim Dietrich, Francois Foucart, Nidhal Guessoum
topic: Searches for electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational-wave signals have redoubled since the first detection in 2017 of a binary neutron star merger with a gamma-ray burst, optical/infrared kilonova, and panchromatic afterglow. Yet, one LIGO/Virgo observing run later, there has not yet been a second, secure identification of an electromagnetic counterpart. This is not surprising given that the localization uncertainties of events in LIGO and Virgo's third observing run, O3, were much larger than predicted. We explain this by showing that improvements in data analysis that now allow LIGO/Virgo to detect weaker and hence more poorly-localized events have increased the overall number of detections, of which well-localized, "gold-plated" events make a smaller proportion overall. We present simulations of the next two LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs, O4 and O5, that are grounded in the statistics of O3 public alerts. To illustrate the significant impact that the updated predictions can have, we study the follow-up strategy for the Zwicky Transient Facility. Realistic and timely forecasting of gravitational-wave localization accuracy is paramount given the large commitments of telescope time and the need to prioritize which events are followed up. We include a data release of our simulated localizations as a public proposal planning resource for astronomers.

title: Neutrino transport with Monte Carlo method: II. Quantum Kinetic Equations
authors: Chinami Kato, Hiroki Nagakura, Taiki Morinaga
topic: Neutrinos have an unique quantum feature as flavor conversions. Recent studies suggested that collective neutrino oscillations play important roles in high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Quantum kinetic equation (QKE) is capable of describing the neutrino flavor conversion, transport and matter collision self-consistently. However, we have experienced many technical difficulties in their numerical implementation. In this paper, we present a new QKE solver based on Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This is an upgraded version of our classical MC neutrino transport solver; in essence, a flavor degree of freedom including mixing state is added into each MC particle. This extension requires updating numerical treatments of collision terms, in particular for scattering processes. We deal with the technical problem by generating a new MC particle at each scattering event. To reduce statistical noise inherent in MC methods, we develop the effective mean free path method. This suppresses a sudden change of flavor state due to collisions without increasing the number of MC particles. We present a suite of code tests to validate these new modules with comparing to the results reported in previous studies. Our QKE-MC solver is developed with fundamentally different philosophy and design from other deterministic- and mesh methods, suggesting that it will be complementary to others, and potentially provide new insights into physical processes of neutrino dynamics.

title: Magnetohydrodynamic with Adaptively Embedded Particle-in-Cell model: MHD-AEPIC
authors: Yinsi Shou, Valeriy Tenishev, Yuxi Chen, Gabor Toth, Natalia Ganushkina
topic: Space plasma simulations have seen an increase in the use of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) with embedded Particle-in-Cell (PIC) models. This combined MHD-EPIC algorithm simulates some regions of interest using the kinetic PIC method while employing the MHD description in the rest of the domain. The MHD models are highly efficient and their fluid descriptions are valid for most part of the computational domain, thus making large-scale global simulations feasible. However, in practical applications, the regions where the kinetic effects are critical can be changing, appearing, disappearing and moving in the computational domain. If a static PIC region is used, this requires a much larger PIC domain than actually needed, which can increase the computational cost dramatically.
To address the problem, we have developed a new method that is able to dynamically change the region of the computational domain where a PIC model is applied. We have implemented this new MHD with Adaptively Embedded PIC (MHD-AEPIC) algorithm using the BATS-R-US Hall MHD and the Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator (AMPS) as the semi-implicit PIC models. We describe the algorithm and present a test case of two merging flux ropes to demonstrate its accuracy. The implementation uses dynamic allocation/deallocation of memory and load balancing for efficient parallel execution. We evaluate the performance of MHD-AEPIC compared to MHD-EPIC and the scaling properties of the model to large number of computational cores.

title: Scattering of ultrastrong electromagnetic waves by magnetized particles
authors: Andrei M. Beloborodov
topic: Observations of powerful radio waves from neutron star magnetospheres raise the question of how strong waves interact with particles in a strong background magnetic field Bbg. This problem is examined by solving the particle motion in the wave. Remarkably, waves with amplitudes [E0>Bbg] pump particle energy via repeating resonance events, quickly reaching the radiation reaction limit. As a result, the wave is scattered with a huge cross section. This fact has great implications for models of fast radio bursts and magnetars. Particles accelerated in the wave emit gamma-rays, which can trigger an e-pm avalanche and, instead of silent escape, the wave will produce X-ray fireworks.

authors: Takashi Minoshima, Takahiro Miyoshi
topic: We propose a new Harten-Lax-van Leer discontinuities (HLLD) approximate Riemann solver to improve the stability of shocks and the accuracy of low-speed flows in multidimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Stringent benchmark tests verify that the new solver is more robust against a numerical shock instability and is more accurate for low-speed, nearly incompressible flows than the original solver, whereas additional computational costs are quite low. The novel ability of the new solver enables us to tackle MHD systems, including both high and low Mach number flows.

title: RAIKOU: A General Relativistic, Multi-wavelength Radiative Transfer Code
authors: Tomohisa Kawashima, Ken Ohsuga, Hiroyuki R. Takahashi
topic: We present a general relativistic, ray-tracing radiative transfer code RAIKOU for multi-wavlength studies of spectra and images including the black hole shadows around Kerr black holes. Important radiative processes in hot plasmas around black holes, i.e., (cyclo-)synchrotron, bremsstrahlung emission/absorption and Compton/inverse-Compton scattering, are incorporated. The Maxwell-Jüttner and single/broken power-law electron distribution functions are implemented to calculate the radiative transfer via both of the thermal and the nonthermal electrons. Two calculation algorithms are implemented for studies of both the images and broadband spectra. An observer-to-emitter algorithm, which inversely solve the radiative transfer equation from the observer screen to emitting plasmas, is suitable for efficient calculations of the images, e.g., the black hole shadows, and spectra without the Compton effects. On the other hand, an emitter-to-observer algorithm, by which photons are transported with a Monte-Carlo method including the effects of Compton/inverse-Compton scatterings, enables us to compute multi-wavelength spectra with their energy bands broadly ranging from radio to very-high-energy gamma-ray. The code is generally applicable to accretion flows around Kerr black holes with relativistic jets and winds/coronae with various mass accretion rate (i.e., radiatively inefficient accretion flows, super-Eddington accretion flows, and others). We demonstrate an application of the code to a radiatively innefficent accretion flow onto a supermassive black hole.

title: Semi Universal relation to understand matter properties at neutron star interiors
authors: Ritam Mallick, Debojoti Kuzur, Rana Nandi
topic: The occurrence of quark matter at the center of neutron stars is still in debate. This study defines some semi-empirical parameters that quantify the occurrence and the amount of quark matter at star interiors. These parameters show semi-universal relations across all the EoS. One parameter depends on the shifting of the keplerian mass-radius curve from the static one and shows it is a constant across all EoS. The Z-parameter shows how tidal deformability depends on the quark content of the star and the stiffness of the EoS. The quark content of the star also affects the compactness of the star, and its dependence is almost universal. The empirical parameter gives a bound on the quark content of the star and shows that if the amount of the quark content increases, the stars are likely to collapse into a black hole. It is seen that the change in the mass and radius after PT is linearly proportional to the mass of the parent NS. Given a hadronic EoS, bag constant, and quark coupling constant, one can have a critical mass of the neutron star and the maximum mass of the hybrid star for phase transition without any baryonic mass loss.

title: Transients from the Cataclysmic Deaths of Cataclysmic Variables
authors: Brian D. Metzger, Yossef Zenati, Laura Chomiuk, Ken J. Shen, Jay Strader
topic: We explore the observational appearance of the merger of a low-mass star with a white dwarf (WD) binary companion. We are motivated by Schreiber et al. (2016), who found that multiple tensions between the observed properties of cataclysmic variables (CVs) and standard evolution models are resolved if a large fraction of CV binaries merge as a result of unstable mass transfer. Tidal disruption of the secondary forms a geometrically thick disk around the WD, which subsequently accretes at highly super-Eddington rates. Analytic estimates and numerical hydrodynamical simulations reveal that outflows from the accretion flow unbind a large fraction 90\% of the secondary at velocities 500-1000 km/s within days of the merger. Hydrogen recombination in the expanding ejecta powers optical transient emission lasting about a month with a luminosity [> 1e38 erg/s], similar to slow classical novae and luminous red novae from ordinary stellar mergers. Over longer timescales the mass accreted by the WD undergoes hydrogen shell burning, inflating the remnant into a giant of luminosity 300-5000 Lsun, effective temperature Teff at 3000 K and lifetime 1e4-1e5 yr. We predict that 1e3-1e4 Milky Way giants are CV merger products, potentially distinguishable by atypical surface abundances. We explore whether any Galactic historical slow classical novae are masquerading CV mergers by identifying four such post-nova systems with potential giant counterparts for which a CV merger origin cannot be ruled out. We address whether the historical transient CK Vul and its gaseous/dusty nebula resulted from a CV merger.

title: The impact of r-process heating on the dynamics of neutron star merger accretion disc winds and their electromagnetic radiation
authors: Hannah Klion, Alexander Tchekhovskoy, Daniel Kasen, Adithan Kathirgamaraju, Eliot Quataert, Rodrigo Fernández
topic: Neutron star merger accretion discs can launch neutron-rich winds of [>10-2Msun]. This ejecta is a prime site for r-process nucleosynthesis, which will produce a range of radioactive heavy nuclei. The decay of these nuclei releases enough energy to accelerate portions of the wind by 0.1c. Here, we investigate the effect of r-process heating on the dynamical evolution of disc winds. We extract the wind from a 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a disc from a post-merger system. This is used to create inner boundary conditions for 2D hydrodynamic simulations that continue the original 3D simulation. We perform two such simulations: one that includes the r-process heating, and another one that does not. We follow the hydrodynamic simulations until the winds reach homology (60 seconds). Using time-dependent multi-frequency multi-dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations, we then calculate the kilonova light curves from the winds with and without dynamical r-process heating. We find that the r-process heating can substantially alter the velocity distribution of the wind, shifting the mass-weighted median velocity from 0.06c to 0.12c. The inclusion of the dynamical r-process heating makes the light curve brighter and bluer at 1 d post-merger. However, the high-velocity tail of the ejecta distribution and the early light curves are largely unaffected.

title: Infrared dust echoes from neutron star mergers
authors: Wenbin Lu (Princeton), Christopher F. McKee (Berkeley), Kunal P. Mooley (Caltech)
topic: A significant fraction of binary neutron star mergers occur in star-forming galaxies where the UV-optical and soft X-ray afterglow emission from the relativistic jet may be absorbed by dust and re-emitted at longer wavelengths. We show that, for mergers occurring in gas-rich environment (n_H > 0.5 cm^{-3} at a few to tens of pc) and when the viewing angle is less than about 30 degrees, the emission from heated dust should be detectable by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with a detection rate of the order once per year. The spatial separation between the dust emission and the merger site is a few to 10 milli-arcsecs (for a source distance of 150 Mpc), which may be astrometrically resolved by JWST for sufficiently high signal-noise-ratio detections. Measuring the superluminal apparent speed of the flux centroid directly gives the orbital inclination of the merger, which can be combined with gravitational wave data to measure the Hubble constant. For a line of sight within the jet opening angle, the dust echoes are much brighter and may contaminate the search for kilonova candidates from short gamma-ray bursts, such as the case of GRB 130603B.

authors: Mark G. Alford, Alexander Haber, Steven P. Harris, Ziyuan Zhang
topic: We calculate the isospin chemical potential that is required for beta equilibrium in nuclear matter under neutron star merger conditions, in the temperature range [1 MeV < T < 5 MeV]. We improve on previous work by using a consistent description of nuclear matter based on the IUF and SFHo relativistic mean field models. This includes using relativistic dispersion relations for the nucleons, which we show is essential in these models. We find that the isospin chemical potential can be of order 10 to 20 MeV, and plays an important role in the correct calculation of Urca rates, which can be wrong by factors of 10 or more if it is neglected.

title: Strong field tests of gravity with electromagnetic and gravitational waves
authors: Sourabh Nampalliwar
topic: For nearly a century, Einstein's theory of gravity has been the standard theory for describing gravitational phenomena in our universe. Along with its successes, limitations of the theory from theoretical (e.g., singularities) and observational (e.g., dark matter/energy) perspectives have appeared. This has led to proposals that modify or supersede Einstein's theory, and testing these theories against data, especially in the strong-field regime, has emerged as a new paradigm in physics in recent years. Along with the completely new avenue of gravitational waves, new and improved techniques based on electromagnetic waves are being used to test general relativity (GR) ever more stringently. As the realm beyond GR is unknown, a popular approach is to look for theory-agnostic deviations from GR/predictions of GR. Here I describe how I have used gravitational waves, X-rays, and black hole shadows to put constraints on some of these theory-agnostic deviations.

title: Numerical modeling and physical interplay of stochastic turbulent acceleration for non-thermal emission processes
authors: Sayan Kundu, Bhargav Vaidya, Andrea Mignone
topic: Particle acceleration is an ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysical and space plasma. Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) and stochastic turbulent acceleration are known to be the possible mechanisms for producing very high energetic particles, particularly in weakly magnetized regions. An interplay of different acceleration processes along with various radiation losses is typically observed in astrophysical sources. While DSA is a systematic acceleration process that energizes particles in the vicinity of shocks, stochastic turbulent acceleration (STA) is a random energizing process, where the interaction between cosmic ray particles and electromagnetic fluctuations results in particle acceleration. This process is usually interpreted as a biased random walk in energy space, modelled through a Fokker-Planck equation. In the present work, we describe a novel Eulerian algorithm, adopted to incorporate turbulent acceleration in the presence of DSA and radiative processes like synchrotron and Inverse-Compton emission. The developed framework extends the hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian module in a full-fledged relativistic Magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) code PLUTO. From our validation tests and case studies, we showcase the competing and complementary nature of both acceleration processes. Axisymmetric simulations of an RMHD jet with this extended hybrid framework clearly demonstrate that emission due to shocks is localized while that due to turbulent acceleration originates in the backflow and is more diffuse, particularly in the high energy X-ray band.

title: Unstable modes of hypermassive compact stars driven by viscosity and gravitational radiation
authors: Peter B. Rau, Armen Sedrakian
topic: We study the oscillations modes of differential rotating remnants of binary neutron star inspirals by modeling them as incompressible Riemann ellipsoids parametrized by the ratio f of their internal circulation to the rotation frequency. The effects of viscosity and gravitational wave radiation on the modes are studied and it is shown that these bodies exhibit generic instabilities towards gravitational wave radiation akin to the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz instabilities for uniformly rotating stars. The odd-parity modes are unstable for all values of f (except for the spherical model) and deformations, whereas the even parity unstable modes appear only in highly eccentric ellipsoids. We quantify the modification of the modes with varying mass of the model and the magnitude of the viscosity. The modes are weakly dependent on the range of the masses relevant to the binary neutron star mergers. Large turbulent viscosity can lead to a suppression of the gravitational wave instabilities, whereas kinematical viscosity has a negligible influence on the modes and their damping timescales.

title: A Bayesian inference and model selection algorithm with an optimisation scheme to infer the model noise power
authors: J. Lopez-Santiago, L. Martino, J. Miguez, M. A. Vazquez
topic: Model fitting is possibly the most extended problem in science. Classical approaches include the use of least-squares fitting procedures and maximum likelihood methods to estimate the value of the parameters in the model. However, in recent years, Bayesian inference tools have gained traction. Usually, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are applied to inference problems, but they present some disadvantages, particularly when comparing different models fitted to the same dataset. Other Bayesian methods can deal with this issue in a natural and effective way. We have implemented an importance sampling algorithm adapted to Bayesian inference problems in which the power of the noise in the observations is not known a priori. The main advantage of importance sampling is that the model evidence can be derived directly from the so-called importance weights -- while MCMC methods demand considerable postprocessing. The use of our adaptive target, adaptive importance sampling (ATAIS) method is shown by inferring, on the one hand, the parameters of a simulated flaring event which includes a damped oscillation {and, on the other hand, real data from the Kepler mission. ATAIS includes a novel automatic adaptation of the target distribution. It automatically estimates the variance of the noise in the model. ATAIS admits parallelisation, which decreases the computational run-times notably. We compare our method against a nested sampling method within a model selection problem.

title: Multi-Frequency Implicit Semi-analog Monte-Carlo (ISMC) Radiative Transfer Solver in Two-Dimensions (without Teleportation)
authors: Elad Steinberg, Shay I. Heizler
topic: We study the multi-dimensional radiative transfer phenomena using the ISMC scheme, in both gray and multi-frequency problems. Implicit Monte-Carlo (IMC) schemes have been in use for five decades. The basic algorithm yields teleportation errors, where photons propagate faster than the correct heat front velocity. Recently [Poette and Valentin, J. Comp. Phys., 412, 109405 (2020)], a new implicit scheme based on the semi-analog scheme was presented and tested in several one-dimensional gray problems. In this scheme, the material energy of the cell is carried by material-particles, and the photons are produced only from existing material particles. As a result, the teleportation errors vanish, due to the infinite discrete spatial accuracy of the scheme. We examine the validity of the new scheme in two-dimensional problems, both in Cartesian and Cylindrical geometries. Additionally, we introduce an expansion of the new scheme for multi-frequency problems. We show that the ISMC scheme presents excellent results without teleportation errors in a large number of benchmarks, especially against the slow classic IMC convergence.

title: Does a long-lived remnant neutron star exist after short gamma-ray burst GRB 160821B?
authors: Guang-Lei Wu, Yun-Wei Yu, Jin-Ping Zhu
topic: Mergers of double neutron stars (DNSs) could lead to the formation of a long-lived massive remnant NS, which has been previously suggested to explain the AT 2017gfo kilonova emission in the famous GW170817 event. For an NS-affected kilonova, it is expected that a non-thermal emission component can be contributed by a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), which results from the interaction of the wind from the remnant NS with the preceding merger ejecta. Then, the discovery of such a non-thermal PWN emission can provide an evidence for the existence of the remnant NS. Similar to GRB 170817A, GRB 160821B is also one of the nearest short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). A candidate kilonova is widely believed to appear in the ultraviolet-optical-infrared afterglows of GRB 160821B. Here, by modeling the afterglow light curves and spectra of GRB 160821B, we find that the invoking of a non-thermal PWN emission can indeed be well consistent with the observational data. This may indicate that the formation of a stable massive NS could be not rare in the DNS merger events and, thus, the equation of state of the post-merger NSs should be stiff enough.

title: Understanding Gamma-ray Burst Jet Structures from Afterglow Light Curves
authors: Celia R. Tandon, Nicole M. Lloyd-Ronning
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), associated with the collapse of massive stars or the collisions of compact objects, are the most luminous events in our universe. However, there is still much to learn about the nature of the relativistic jets launched from the central engines of these objects. We examine how jet structure - that is, the energy and velocity distribution as a function of angle - affects observed GRB afterglow light curves. Using the package afterglowpy, we compute light curves arising from an array of possible jet structures, and present the suite of models that can fit the coincident electromagnetic observations of GW190814 (which is likely due to a background AGN). Our work emphasizes not only the need for broadband spectral and timing data to distinguish among jet structure models, but also the necessity for high resolution radio follow-up to help resolve background sources that may mimic a GRB afterglow.

title: Entropy-Conserving Scheme for Modeling Nonthermal Energies in Fluid Dynamics Simulations
authors: Vadim A. Semenov, Andrey V. Kravtsov, Benedikt Diemer
topic: We compare the performance of energy-based and entropy-conservative schemes for modeling nonthermal energy components, such as unresolved turbulence and cosmic rays, using idealized fluid dynamics tests and isolated galaxy simulations. While both methods are aimed to model advection and adiabatic compression or expansion of different energy components, the energy-based scheme numerically solves the non-conservative equation for the energy density evolution, while the entropy-conserving scheme uses a conservative equation for modified entropy. Using the standard shock tube and Zel'dovich pancake tests, we show that the energy-based scheme results in a spurious generation of nonthermal energy on shocks, while the entropy-conserving method evolves the energy adiabatically to machine precision. We also show that, in simulations of an isolated L galaxy, switching between the schemes results in 20-30\% changes of the total star formation rate and a significant difference in morphology, particularly near the galaxy center. We also outline and test a simple method that can be used in conjunction with the entropy-conserving scheme to model the injection of nonthermal energies on shocks. Finally, we discuss how the entropy-conserving scheme can be used to capture the kinetic energy dissipated by numerical viscosity into the subgrid turbulent energy implicitly, without explicit source terms that require calibration and can be rather uncertain. Our results indicate that the entropy-conserving scheme is the preferred choice for modeling nonthermal energy components, a conclusion that is equally relevant for Eulerian and moving-mesh fluid dynamics codes.

title: Rates of Compact Object Coalescences
authors: Ilya Mandel, Floor S. Broekgaarden
topic: Gravitational-wave detections are enabling measurements of the rate of coalescences of binaries composed of two compact objects - neutron stars and/or black holes. The coalescence rate of binaries containing neutron stars is further constrained by electromagnetic observations, including Galactic radio binary pulsars and short gamma-ray bursts. Meanwhile, increasingly sophisticated models of compact objects merging through a variety of evolutionary channels produce a range of theoretically predicted rates. Rapid improvements in instrument sensitivity, along with plans for new and improved surveys, make this an opportune time to summarise the existing observational and theoretical knowledge of compact-binary coalescence rates.

title: Bayesian inference of strange star equation of state using the GW170817 and GW190425 data
authors: Zhiqiang Miao, Jin-Liang Jiang, Ang Li, Lie-Wen Chen
topic: The observations of compact star inspirals from LIGO/Virgo provide a valuable tool to study the highly uncertain equation of state (EOS) of dense matter at the densities in which the compact stars reside. It is not clear whether the merging stars are neutron stars or quark stars containing self-bound quark matter. In this work, we explore the allowed bag-model-like EOSs for the possibility of the latter by assuming the merging stars are strange quark stars (SQSs) from a Bayesian analysis employing the tidal deformability observational data of the GW170817 and GW190425 binary mergers. We consider two extreme states of strange quark matter, either in nonsuperfluid or color-flavor locked (CFL) and find the results in these two cases essentially reconcile. In particular, our results indicate that the sound speed in the SQS matter is approximately a constant close to the conformal limit. The universal relations between the mass, the tidal defromability and the compactness are provided for the SQSs. The most probable values of the maximum mass are found to be MTOV=2.10+0.12-0.12 (2.15+0.16-0.14) for normal (CFL) SQSs at 90\% confidence level. The corresponding radius and tidal deformability for a 1.4 star are R1.4=11.50+0.52-0.55 (11.42+0.52-0.44) km and Lam1.4=650+230-190 (630+220-150), respectively. We also investigate the possibility of GW190814's secondary component m2 of mass 2.59+0.08-0.09Msun as a SQS, and find that it could be a CFL SQS with the pairing gap Delta larger than 244 MeV and the effective bag parameter B1/4eff in the range of 170 to 192 MeV, at 90\% confidence level.

title: Inferring properties of neutron stars born in short gamma-ray bursts with a plerion-like X-ray plateau
authors: L. C. Strang, A. Melatos, N. Sarin, P. D. Lasky
topic: Time-resolved spectra of six short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), measured by the {\em Swift} telescope, are used to estimate the parameters of a plerion-like model of the X-ray afterglow. The unshrouded, optically thin component of the afterglow is modelled as emanating from an expanding bubble of relativistic, shock-accelerated electrons fuelled by a central object. The electrons are injected with a power-law distribution and cool mainly by synchrotron losses. We compute posteriors for model parameters describing the central engine (e.g. spin frequency at birth, magnetic field strength) and shock acceleration (e.g. power-law index, minimum injection energy). It is found that the central engine is compatible with a millisecond magnetar, and the shock physics is compatible with what occurs in Galactic supernova remnants, assuming standard magnetic field models for the magnetar wind. Separately, we allow the magnetic field to vary arbitrarily and infer that it is roughly constant and lower in magnitude than the wind-borne extension of the inferred magnetar field. This may be due to the expansion history of the bubble, or the magnetization of the circumstellar environment of the sGRB progenitor.

title: Constraining Properties of GRB Central Engines with X-ray flares
authors: Shuang-Xi Yi, Wei Xie, Shuai-Bing Ma, Wei-Hua Lei, Mei Du
topic: X-ray flares in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to be generated by the late activities of central engine, and thus provide an useful tool to diagnose the properties of central objects. In this paper, we work on a GRB X-ray flare sample whose bulk Lorentz factors are constrained by two different methods and the jet opening angles are determined by the jet breaks in afterglow lightcurves. Considering a hyperaccreting stellar-mass black hole (BH) as the central engine of GRBs and the Blandford \& Znajek process (BZ) as the jet production mechanism, we constrain the parameters of central engine by using the X-ray flare data. We find that the BZ mechanism is so powerful making it possible to interpret both GRB prompt emissions and bright X-ray flares. The wind parameter (p) and accreted mass (Md) fall into reasonable ranges. Our result is also applied to GRB 170817A. The late X-ray flare in GRB 170817A, if it is true, might not be a BH origin.

title: Gravitational Radiation from Accelerating Jets
authors: Elly Leiderschneider, Tsvi Piran
topic: Non-spherical rapid acceleration of mass (or energy) to a relativistic velocity is a natural source of gravitational radiation. Such conditions arise in both long and short gamma-ray bursts whose central engine ejects relativistic jets. The resulting gravitational wave signal is of a memory type, rising to a finite level (of order 4 G E/r) over a duration that corresponds to the longer of either the injection time and the acceleration time of the jet. We explore the properties of such signals and their potential detectability. Unfortunately, the expected signals are below the frequency band of Advanced LIGO-Virgo-Kagra, and above LISA. However, they fall within the range of the planned BBO and DECIGO. While current sensitivity is marginal for the detection of jet gravitational wave signals from GRBs, hidden relativistic jets that exist within some core collapse SNe could be detected. Such a detection would reveal the acceleration mechanism and the activity of the central engine, which cannot be explored directly in any other way

title: Can the BZ mechanism power steady jets?
authors: A.R. King, J.E. Pringle
topic: We consider the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism for extracting black hole spin energy to drive astrophysical jets. In analyses of the BZ mechanism it is always assumed that the electric charge of the black hole remains zero. But, as noted by Wald and others, if the medium surrounding the black hole is an ionised plasma with mobile charges, then a spinning hole quickly acquires an electric charge. The effect of this charge is to nullify the electric field structures which drive the BZ mechanism -- the electric and magnetic fields then obey EB=0 everywhere. Since jets are now observed in a wide variety of classes of accreting objects, most of which do not contain a central black hole, it seems likely that the jet driving mechanism in all astrophysical objects uses energy directly from the accretion disc, rather than black hole spin.

title: Modified jump conditions for parallel collisionless shocks
authors: Antoine Bret
topic: Within the context of Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the properties of a parallel shock do not depend on the field strength, as the field and the fluid are disconnected for such a geometry. However, in the collisionless case, the field can sustain a stable anisotropy in the downstream, triggering a departure from the expected MHD behavior. In a recent work [A. Bret and R. Narayan, J. Plasma Phys. \textbf{84}, 905840604 (2018)], a theoretical model was presented allowing to derive the density ratio of a non-relativistic parallel collisionless shock in an electron/positron plasma, as a function of the field. Here we derive the entropy, pressure and temperature jumps stemming from this model. It is found to offer a transition between a 3D and a 1D downstream for the jumps in density, entropy, parallel temperature and parallel pressure.

title: Special Relativistic Hydrodynamics with CRONOS
authors: David Huber, Ralf Kissmann
topic: We describe the special relativistic extension of the CRONOS code, which has been used for studies of gamma-ray binaries in recent years. The code was designed to be easily adaptable, allowing the user to easily change existing functionalities or introduce new modules tailored to the problem at hand. Numerically, the equations are treated using a finite-volume Godunov scheme on rectangular grids, which currently support Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates. The employed reconstruction technique, the approximate Riemann solver and the equation of state can be chosen dynamically by the user. Further, the code was designed with stability and robustness in mind, detecting and mitigating possible failures early on. We demonstrate the code's capabilities on an extensive set of validation problems.

title: A Comprehensive Consistency Check between Synchrotron radiation and the Observed Gamma-ray Burst Spectra
authors: Dao-Zhou Wang, Xiao-Hong Zhao, Zhao Zhang, Bin-Bin Zhang, Zhao-Yang Peng
topic: We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of 53 bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by \textit{Fermi}/GBM. Our sample consists of 908 individual spectra extracted from the finest time slices in each GRB. We fitted them with the synchrotron radiation model by considering the electron distributions in five different cases: mono-energetic, single power-law, Maxwellian, traditional fast cooling, and broken power-law. Our results were further qualified through Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) by comparing with the fit by empirical models, namely the so-called Band function and cut-off power-law models. Our study showed that the synchrotron models, except for the fast-cooling case, can successfully fit most observed spectra, with the single power-law case being the most preferred. We also found that the electron distribution indices for the single power-law synchrotron fit in more than half of our spectra exhibits flux-tracking behavior, i.e., the index increases/decreases with the flux increasing/decreasing, implying that the distribution of the radiating electrons is increasingly narrower with time before the flux peaks and becomes more spreading afterward. Our results indicate that the synchrotron radiation is still feasible as a radiation mechanism of the GRB prompt emission phase.

title: On the use of CHIME to Detect Long-Duration Radio Transients from Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Minori Shikauchi, Kipp Cannon, Haoxiang Lin, Tomonori Totani, J. Richard Shaw
topic: Short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) GRB170817A was found to be related to a binary neutron star (BNS) merger. It is uncertain whether all SGRBs are caused by BNS mergers, and also under what conditions a BNS merger can cause a SGRB. Search for long-duration afterglow from SGRBs in the radio band can reveal the details of the energy sources of SGRBs, the relativistic jet, and will provide important clues on their nature (Kasliwal et al. 2017). As BNS mergers can cause SGRBs, afterglow observations will also provide an alternative measurement of BNS merger rate independent of gravitational wave (GW) observations. In previous work by Feng et al. (2014), the feasibility of the detection of long-duration afterglows was considered using a variety of radio observatories and a simple flux threshold detection algorithm. Here, we consider a more sophisticated detection algorithm for SGRB afterglows, and provide an estimate of the trials factors for a realistic search to obtain an updated estimate for the possibility of observing afterglows with CHIME. Based on our detection algorithm, we estimate 751 afterglows per year can be detected using CHIME with 96 % of them off-axis, which are candidates for orphan afterglows. Our result predicts significantly fewer detectable sources per year than the earlier analysis (Feng et al. 2014), but confirms the essential conclusion that using CHIME to search for long-duration afterglows will be effective at constraining the astrophysical merger rate.

title: Imposing multi-physics constraints at different densities on the Neutron Star Equation of State
authors: Suprovo Ghosh, Debarati Chatterjee, Jürgen Schaffner-Bielich
topic: Neutron star matter spans a wide range of densities, from that of nuclei at the surface to exceeding several times normal nuclear matter density in the core. While terrestrial experiments, such as nuclear or heavy-ion collision experiments, provide clues about the behaviour of dense nuclear matter, one must resort to theoretical models of neutron star matter to extrapolate to higher density and finite neutron/proton asymmetry relevant for neutron stars. In this work, we explore the parameter space within the framework of the Relativistic Mean Field model allowed by present uncertainties compatible with state-of-the-art experimental data. We apply a Bayesian scheme to constrain the parameter space using multi-physics constraints at different density regimes: chiral effective field theory, nuclear and heavy-ion collision data as well as multi-messenger astrophysical observations of neutron stars. Using the results of the study, we investigate possible correlations between nuclear and astrophysical observables.

title: Black-Hole Neutron Star Simulations with the BAM code: First Tests and Simulations
authors: Swami Vivekanandji Chaurasia, Tim Dietrich, Stephan Rosswog
topic: The first detections of black hole - neutron star mergers (GW200105 and GW200115) by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra Collaboration mark a significant scientific breakthrough. The physical interpretation of pre- and post-merger signals requires careful cross-examination between observational and theoretical modelling results. Here we present the first set of black hole - neutron star simulations that were obtained with the numerical-relativity code BAM. Our initial data are constructed using the public LORENE spectral library which employs an excision of the black hole interior. BAM, in contrast, uses the moving-puncture gauge for the evolution. Therefore, we need to stuff the black hole interior with smooth initial data to evolve the binary system in time. This procedure introduces constraint violations such that the constraint damping properties of the evolution system are essential to increase the accuracy of the simulation and in particular to reduce spurious center-of-mass drifts. Within BAM we evolve the Z4c equations and we compare our gravitational-wave results with those of the SXS collaboration and results obtained with the SACRA code. While we find generally good agreement with the reference solutions and phase differences 0.5 rad at the moment of merger, the absence of a clean convergence order in our simulations does not allow for a proper error quantification. We finally present a set of different initial conditions to explore how the merger of black hole neutron star systems depends on the involved masses, spins, and equations of state.

title: Sgr A* X-ray flares from non-thermal particle acceleration in a magnetically arrested disc
authors: Nicolas Scepi, Jason Dexter, Mitchell C. Begelman
topic: Sgr Astar exhibits flares in the near-infrared and X-ray bands, with the luminosity in these bands increasing by factors of 10-100 for 60 minutes. One of the models proposed to explain these flares is synchrotron emission of non-thermal particles accelerated by magnetic reconnection events in the accretion flow. We use the results from PIC simulations of magnetic reconnection to post-process 3D two-temperature GRMHD simulations of a magnetically arrested disc (MAD). We identify current sheets, retrieve their properties, estimate their potential to accelerate non-thermal particles and compute the expected non-thermal synchrotron emission. We find that the flux eruptions of MADs can provide suitable conditions for accelerating non-thermal particles to energies and producing simultaneous X-ray and near-infrared flares. For a suitable choice of current-sheet parameters and a simpified synchrotron cooling prescription, the model can simultaneously reproduce the quiescent and flaring X-ray luminosities as well as the X-ray spectral shape. While the near-infrared flares are mainly due to an increase in the temperature near the black hole during the MAD flux eruptions, the X-ray emission comes from narrow current sheets bordering highly magnetized, low-density regions near the black hole. As a result, not all infrared flares are accompanied by X-ray ones. The non-thermal flaring emission can extend to very hard X-ray energies.

topic: The association of GRB170817A with GW170817 has confirmed the long-standing hypothesis that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are the progenitors of at least some short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). This connection has ushered in an era in which broadband observations of SGRBs, together with measurements of the time delay between the gravitational waves and the electromagnetic radiation, allow to probe the properties of the emitting outflow and its engine to an unprecedented detail. Since the structure of the radiating outflow is molded by the interaction of a relativistic jet with the binary ejecta, it is of paramount importance to study the system in a realistic setting. Here we present a three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of a relativistic jet propagating in the ejecta of a BNS merger, which were computed with a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation. We find that the jet's centroid oscillates around the axis of the system, due to inhomogeneities encountered in the propagation. These oscillations allow the jet to find the path of least resistance and travel faster than an identical jet in smooth ejecta. In our setup the breakout time is 0.6 sec, comparable to the expected central engine duration in SGRBs and possibly a non-negligible fraction of the total delay between the gravitational and gamma-ray signals. Our simulation also shows that energy is carried in roughly equal amounts by the jet and by the cocoon, and that about 20 per cent of the injected energy is transferred to the ejecta via mechanical work.

title: Modeling Neutron Star Oscillations in a Fixed General Relativistic Background Including Solid Crust Dynamics
authors: Bing-Jyun Tsao, Irina Sagert, Oleg Korobkin, Ingo Tews, Hyun Lim, Gary Dilts, Julien Loiseau
topic: Measurements of the gravitational-wave signals from neutron star mergers allow scientists to learn about the interior of neutron stars and the properties of dense nuclear matter. The study of neutron star mergers is usually performed with computational fluid dynamics codes, mostly in Eulerian but also in Lagrangian formulation such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Codes include our best knowledge of nuclear matter in the form of an equation of state as well as effects of general relativity (GR). However, one important aspect of neutron stars is usually ignored: the solid nature of their crust. The solid matter in the crust is the strongest material known in nature which could lead to a multitude of possible observational effects that have not been studied in dynamical simulations yet. The crust could change the way a neutron star deforms during a merger, leaving an imprint in the gravitational wave signal. It could even shatter during the inspiral, producing a potentially observable electromagnetic signal. Here, we present a first study of the dynamical behavior of neutron stars with a solid crust and fixed GR background with FleCSPH. FleCSPH is a general-purpose SPH code, developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. It features an efficient algorithm for gravitational interactions via the Fast Multipole Method, which, together with the implemented nuclear equation of state, makes it appropriate for astrophysical applications. The solid material dynamics is described via the elastic-perfectly plastic model with maximum-strain breaking. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces the stress-strain curve of crustal material as extracted from microphysical simulations very well. We present first tests of our implementation via simulations of neutron star oscillations and give an outlook on our study of the dynamical behavior of the solid crust in neutron star merger events.

title: Conservation of Angular Momentum in the Fast Multipole Method
authors: Oleg Korobkin, Hyun Lim, Irina Sagert, Julien Loiseau, Christopher Mauney, M. Alexander R. Kaltenborn, Bing-Jyun Tsao, Wesley P. Even
topic: Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is positioned as having ideal conservation properties. When properly implemented, conservation of total mass, energy, and both linear and angular momentum is guaranteed exactly, up to machine precision. This is particularly important for some applications in computational astrophysics, such as binary dynamics, mergers, and accretion of compact objects (neutron stars, black holes, and white dwarfs). However, in astrophysical applications that require the inclusion of gravity, calculating pairwise particle interactions becomes prohibitively expensive. In the Fast Multipole Method (FMM), they are, therefore, replaced with symmetric interactions between distant clusters of particles (contained in the tree nodes) Although such an algorithm is linear momentum-conserving, it introduces spurious torques that violate conservation of angular momentum. We present a modification of FMM that is free of spurious torques and conserves angular momentum explicitly. The new method has practically no computational overhead compared to the standard FMM.

topic: We present numbus : a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the intrinsic luminosity parameters of kilonovae (KNe) associated with gravitational-wave (GW) events, based purely on non-detections. This framework makes use of GW 3-D distance information and electromagnetic upper limits from a given survey for multiple events, and self-consistently accounts for finite sky-coverage and probability of astrophysical origin. The framework is agnostic to the brightness evolution assumed and can account for multiple electromagnetic passbands simultaneously. Our analyses highlight the importance of accounting for model selection effects, especially in the context of non-detections. We show our methodology using a simple, two-parameter linear brightness model, taking the follow-up of GW190425 with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) as a single-event test case for two different prior choices of model parameters -- (i) uniform/uninformative priors and (ii) astrophysical priors based on surrogate models of Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations of KNe. We present results under the assumption that the KN is within the searched region to demonstrate functionality and the importance of prior choice. Our results show consistency with 𝚜𝚒𝚖𝚜𝚞𝚛𝚟𝚎𝚢 -- an astronomical survey simulation tool used previously in the literature to constrain the population of KNe. While our results based on uniform priors strongly constrain the parameter space, those based on astrophysical priors are largely uninformative, highlighting the need for deeper constraints. Future studies with multiple events having electromagnetic follow-up from multiple surveys should make it possible to constrain the KN population further.

title: Impact of the nuclear symmetry energy on the post-merger phase of a binary neutron star coalescence
authors: Elias R. Most, Carolyn A. Raithel
topic: The nuclear symmetry energy plays a key role in determining the equation of state of dense, neutron-rich matter, which governs the properties of both terrestrial nuclear matter as well as astrophysical neutron stars. A recent measurement of the neutron skin thickness from the PREX collaboration has lead to new constraints on the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy, L, which can be directly compared to inferences from gravitational-wave observations of the first binary neutron star merger inspiral, GW170817 In this paper, we explore a new regime for potentially constraining the slope, L, of the nuclear symmetry energy with future gravitational wave events: the post-merger phase a binary neutron star coalescence. In particular, we go beyond the inspiral phase, where imprints of the slope parameter L may be inferred from measurements of the tidal deformability, to consider imprints on the post-merger dynamics, gravitational wave emission, and dynamical mass ejection. To this end, we perform a set of targeted neutron star merger simulations in full general relativity using new finite-temperature equations of state, which systematically vary L. We find that the post-merger dynamics and gravitational wave emission are mostly insensitive to the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy. In contrast, we find that dynamical mass ejection contains a weak imprint of L, with large values of L leading to systematically enhanced ejecta.

title: Radio constraint on outflows from tidal disruption events
authors: Tatsuya Matsumoto, Tsvi Piran
topic: Radio flares from tidal disruption events (TDEs) are generally interpreted as synchrotron emission arising from the interaction of an outflow with the surrounding circumnuclear medium (CNM). We generalize the common equipartition analysis to be applicable in cases lacking a clear spectral peak or even with just an upper limit. We show that, for detected events, there is a lower limit on the combination of the outflow's velocity and solid angle that constrains the outflow's properties. Considering several possible outflow components accompanying TDEs, we find that: Isotropic outflows such as disk winds can easily produces the observed flares; The bow shock of the unbound debris has a wedge-like geometry and it must be thick with and a fraction of its mass has to move fast Conical Newtonian outflows such as jets can also be a radio source but both their velocity and the CNM density should be larger than those of isotropic winds by a factor. Our limits on the CNM densities are typically times larger than those found by previous analysis that ignored non-relativistic electrons that do not emit synchrotron radiation. We show that unless are known radio observation alone cannot determine the CNM density. We also find that late (a few years after the TDE) radio upper-limits rule out energetic, 1051-52erg, relativistic jets like the one observed in TDE Sw J1644+57, implying that such jets are rare.

authors: Elias R. Most, Steven P. Harris, Christopher Plumberg, Mark G. Alford, Jorge Noronha, Jacquelyn Noronha-Hostler, Frans Pretorius, Helvi Witek, Nicolás Yunes 
topic: In this work, we estimate how much bulk viscosity driven by Urca processes is likely to affect the gravitational wave signal of a neutron star coalescence. In the late inspiral, we show that bulk viscosity affects the binding energy at fourth post-Newtonian (PN) order. Even though this effect is enhanced by the square of the gravitational compactness, the coefficient of bulk viscosity is likely too small to lead to observable effects in the waveform during the late inspiral, when only considering the orbital motion itself. In the post-merger, however, the characteristic time-scales and spatial scales are different, potentially leading to the opposite conclusion. We post-process data from a state-of-the-art equal-mass binary neutron star merger simulation to estimate the effects of bulk viscosity (which was not included in the simulation itself). In that scenario, we find that bulk viscosity can reach high values in regions of the merger. We compute several estimates of how much it might directly affect the global dynamics of the considered merger scenario, and find that it could become significant. Even larger effects could arise in different merger scenarios or in simulations that include non-linear effects. This assessment is reinforced by a quantitative comparison with relativistic heavy-ion collisions where such effects have been explored extensively.

topic: We present new radio and optical data, including very long baseline interferometry, as well as archival data analysis, for the luminous decades-long radio transient FIRST J141918.9+394036. The radio data reveal a synchrotron self-absorption peak around 0.3 GHz and a radius of 1.2 0.5 mas (0.5 0.2 pc) 26 years post-discovery, indicating a blastwave energy 5x1050 erg. The optical spectrum shows a broad O3 line emission-line that may indicate collisional-excitation in the host galaxy, but its association with the transient cannot be ruled out. The properties of the host galaxy are suggestive of a massive stellar progenitor that formed at low metallicity. Based on the radio light curve, blastwave velocity, energetics, nature of the host galaxy and transient rates we find that the properties of FIRST J1419+39 are most consistent with long gamma-ray burst (LGRB) afterglows. Other classes of (optically-discovered) stellar explosions as well as neutron star mergers are disfavored, and invoking any exotic scenario may not be necessary. It is therefore likely that FIRST J1419+39 is an off-axis LGRB afterglow (as suggested by Law et al. and Marcote et al.), and under this premise the inverse beaming fraction is found, corresponding to an average jet half-opening angle, consistent with previous estimates. From the volumetric rate we predict that surveys with the VLA, ASKAP and MeerKAT will find a handful of FIRST J1419+39-like events over the coming years.

topic: We study the prompt phase of low-luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts (LL-GRBs) as potential source of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays and ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We model the spectral energy distribution of three representative events (with observed properties similar to GRBs 980425, 100316D and 120714B) self-consistently in a leptonic synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenario using the internal shock model for the relativistic outflow. To investigate the conditions under which inverse Compton radiation may lead to a peak in the GeV-TeV range potentially observable in Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), we vary the fraction of the internal energy supplying the magnetic field. Further, we determine the maximal energies achievable for UHECR nuclei and derive constraints on the baryonic loading and typical GRB duration by comparing to the extragalactic gamma-ray background. We find that LL-GRBs are potential targets for multi-wavelength studies and may be in reach of IACTs and optical/ UV instruments. For comparable sub-MeV emission and similar dynamical evolution of the outflow, the multi-wavelength predictions depend on the magnetic field: weak (strong) magnetic fields induce high (low) fluxes in the VHE regime and low (high) fluxes in the optical. VHE emission might be suppressed by gamma-gammma-absorption close to the engine (especially for high magnetic fields) or interactions with the extragalactic background light for redshifts z \g 0.1. For UHECRs, the maximal energies of iron nuclei (protons) can be as high as 1011-GeV (1010-GeV) if the magnetic energy density is large (where we found a weak VHE component). These high energies are possible by decoupling the production regions of UHECR and gamma-rays in our multi-zone model. Finally, we find basic consistency with the energy budget needed to accommodate the UHECR origin from LL-GRBs.

title: The Mass Distribution of Neutron Stars in Gravitational-Wave Binaries
authors: Philippe Landry, Jocelyn S. Read
topic: The discovery of two neutron star-black hole coalescences by LIGO and Virgo brings the total number of likely neutron stars observed in gravitational waves to six. We perform the first inference of the mass distribution of this extragalactic population of neutron stars. In contrast to the bimodal Galactic population detected primarily as radio pulsars, the masses of neutron stars in gravitational-wave binaries are thus far consistent with a uniform distribution, with a greater prevalence of high-mass neutron stars. The maximum mass in the gravitational-wave population agrees with that inferred from the neutron stars in our Galaxy and with expectations from dense matter.

title: The Photosphere Emission Spectrum of Hybrid Relativistic Outflow for Gamma-ray Bursts
authors: Yan-Zhi Meng, Jin-Jun Geng, Xue-Feng Wu
topic: The photospheric emission in the prompt phase is the natural prediction of the original fireball model for gamma-ray burst (GRB) due to the large optical depth (tau \g 1) at the base of the outflow, which is supported by the quasi-thermal components detected in several Fermi GRBs. However, which radiation mechanism (photosphere or synchrotron) dominates in most GRB spectra is still under hot debate. The shape of the observed photosphere spectrum from a pure hot fireball or a pure Poynting-flux-dominated outflow has been investigated before. In this work, we further study the photosphere spectrum from a hybrid outflow containing both a thermal component and a magnetic component with moderate magnetization, by invoking the probability photosphere model. The high-energy spectrum from such a hybrid outflow is a power law rather than an exponential cutoff, which is compatible with the observed Band function in large amounts of GRBs. Also, the distribution of the low-energy indices (corresponding to the peak-flux spectra) is found to be quite consistent with the statistical result for the peak-flux spectra of GRBs best-fitted by the Band function, with similar angular profiles of structured jet in our previous works. Finally, the observed distribution of the high-energy indices can be well understood after considering the different magnetic acceleration (due to magnetic reconnection and kink instability) and the angular profiles of dimensionless entropy with the narrower core.

title: Brightness temperature constraints on coherent processes in magnetospheres of neutron stars
authors: Maxim Lyutikov 
topic: We discuss constraints that the observed brightness temperatures impose on coherent processes in pulsars and Fast Radio Burst (FRBs), and in particular on the hypothesis of coherent curvature emission by bunches. First, we point out an important difference between emitted and observed power for curvature radiation: since the emitting particle comes into view once during its trajectory the resulting peak observed power is higher than the emitted one by gamma2. Second, we estimate the peak brightness temperature that a bunch of charge Ze can produce via synchrotron and/or curvature emission as kBT-(Ze)2/lambda, where lambda is the typical emitted wavelength. We demonstrate that the bunch's electrostatic energy required to produce observed brightness temperature is prohibitively high, of the order of the total bulk energy. We compare corresponding requirements for the Free Electron Laser mechanism (Lyutikov 2021) and find that in that case the constraints are much easier satisfied.

title: Analytic Light Curves of Dense CSM Shock Breakout and Cooling
authors: Ben Margalit
topic: Dense circumstellar material (CSM) is thought to play an important role in observed luminous optical transients: if such CSM is shocked, e.g. by ejecta expelled from the progenitor during core-collapse, then radiation produced by the shock-heated CSM can power bright UV/optical emission. If the initial CSM has an outer edge where most of the mass is contained and at which the optical depth is large, then shock breakout -- when photons are first able to escape the shocked CSM -- occurs near this outer edge. The thin shell of shocked CSM subsequently expands, and in the ensuing cooling-envelope phase, radiative and adiabatic losses compete to expend the CSM thermal energy. Here we derive an analytic solution to the bolometric light-curve produced by such shocked CSM. For the first time, we provide a solution to the cooling-envelope phase that is applicable already starting from shock breakout. In particular, we account for the planar CSM geometry that is relevant at early times and impose physically-motivated initial conditions. We show that these effects can dramatically impact the resulting light-curves, particularly if the CSM optical depth is only marginally larger than c/vsh (where vsh is the shock velocity). This has important implications for interpreting observed fast optical transients, which have previously been modeled using either computationally-expensive numerical simulations or more simplified models that do not properly capture the early light-curve evolution.

title: Correlations of r-Process Elements in Very Metal-Poor Stars as Clues to their Nucleosynthesis Sites
authors: Khalil Farouqi, Friedrich-Karl Thielemann, Stephan Rosswog, Karl-Ludwig Kratz
topic: Various nucleosynthesis studies have pointed out that the r-process elements in very metal-poor (VMP) halo stars might have different origins. By means of familiar concepts from statistics (correlations, cluster analysis, rank tests of elemental abundances), we look for causally correlated elemental abundance patterns and attempt to link them to astrophysical events. Some of these events produce the r-process elements jointly with iron, while others do not have any significant iron contribution. In the early stage of our Galaxy, at least three r-process nucleosynthesis sites have been active. The first two produce and eject iron and the majority of the lighter r-process elements. We assign them to two different types of core-collapse events, not identical to regular core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which produce only light trans-Fe elements. The third category is characterized by a strong r-process and responsible for the major fraction of the heavy main r-process elements without a significant co-production of Fe. It does not appear to be connected to CCSNe, in fact the Fe found in the related r-process enriched stars must come from previously occurring CCSNe. The existence of actinide boost stars indicates a further division among strong r-process sites. We assign these two strong r-process sites to neutron star mergers without fast black hole formation and to events where the ejecta are dominated by black hole accretion disk outflows. Indications from the lowest-metallicity stars hint at a connection to massive single stars (collapsars) forming black holes in the early Galaxy.

topic: Cyclotron line scattering features are detected in a few tens of X-ray pulsars (XRPs) and used as direct indicators of a strong magnetic field at the surface of accreting neutron stars (NSs). In a few cases, cyclotron lines are known to be variable with accretion luminosity of XRPs. It is accepted that the observed variations of cyclotron line scattering features are related to variations of geometry and dynamics of accretion flow above the magnetic poles of a NS. A positive correlation between the line centroid energy and luminosity is typical for sub-critical XRPs, where the accretion results in hot spots at the magnetic poles. The negative correlation was proposed to be a specific feature of bright super-critical XRPs, where radiation pressure supports accretion columns above the stellar surface. Cyclotron line in spectra of Be-transient X-ray pulsar GRO J1008-57 is detected at energies from 75−90 keV, the highest observed energy of cyclotron line feature in XRPs. We report the peculiar relation of cyclotron line centroid energies with luminosity in GRO J1008-57 during the Type II outburst in August 2017 observed by Insight-HXMT. The cyclotron line energy was detected to be negatively correlated with the luminosity at and positively correlated at. We speculate that the observed peculiar behavior of a cyclotron line would be due to variations of accretion channel geometry.

title: Rapid parameter estimation of a two-component neutron star model with spin wandering using a Kalman filter
authors: Patrick M. Meyers, Nicholas J. O'Neill, Andrew Melatos, Robin J. Evans
topic: The classic, two-component, crust-superfluid model of a neutron star can be formulated as a noise-driven, linear dynamical system, in which the angular velocities of the crust and superfluid are tracked using a Kalman filter applied to electromagnetic pulse timing data and gravitational wave data, when available. Here it is shown how to combine the marginal likelihood of the Kalman filter and nested sampling to estimate full posterior distributions of the six model parameters, extending previous analyses based on a maximum-likelihood approach. The method is tested across an astrophysically plausible parameter domain using Monte Carlo simulations. It recovers the injected parameters to 10 per cent for time series containing 103 samples, typical of long-term pulsar timing campaigns. It runs efficiently in (1) CPU-hr for data sets of the above size. In a present-day observational scenario, when electromagnetic data are available only, the method accurately estimates three parameters: the relaxation time, the ensemble-averaged spin-down of the system, and the amplitude of the stochastic torques applied to the crust. In a future observational scenario, where gravitational wave data are also available, the method also estimates the ratio between the moments of inertia of the crust and the superfluid, the amplitude of the stochastic torque applied to the superfluid, and the crust-superfluid lag. These empirical results are consistent with a formal identifiability analysis of the linear dynamical system.

topic: Neutron-star mergers were recently confirmed as sites of rapid-neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis. However, in Galactic chemical evolution models, neutron-star mergers alone cannot reproduce the observed element abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars, which indicates the existence of other sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. These sites may be investigated by studying the element abundance patterns of chemically primitive stars in the halo of the Milky Way, because these objects retain the nucleosynthetic signatures of the earliest generation of stars. Here we report the element abundance pattern of the extremely metal-poor star SMSS J200322.54-114203.3. We observe a large enhancement in r-process elements, with very low overall metallicity. The element abundance pattern is well matched by the yields of a single 25-solar-mass magnetorotational hypernova. Such a hypernova could produce not only the r-process elements, but also light elements during stellar evolution, and iron-peak elements during explosive nuclear burning. Hypernovae are often associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts in the nearby Universe. This connection indicates that similar explosions of fast-spinning strongly magnetized stars occurred during the earliest epochs of star formation in our Galaxy.

title: Gamma-Ray Emission Produced by r-process Elements from Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Meng-Hua Chen, Li-Xin Li, Da-Bin Lin, En-Wei Liang
topic: The observation of a radioactively powered kilonova AT2017gfo associated with the gravitational wave-event GW170817 from binary neutron star merger proves that these events are ideal sites for the production of heavy r-process elements. The gamma-ray photons produced by the radioactive decay of heavy elements are unique probes for the detailed nuclide compositions. Basing on the detailed r-process nucleosynthesis calculations and considering radiative transport calculations for the gamma-rays in different shells, we study the gamma-ray emission in a merger ejecta on a timescale of a few days. It is found that the total gamma-ray energy generation rate evolution is roughly depicted For the dynamical ejecta with a low electron fraction (Ye0.20), the dominant contributors of gamma-ray energy are the nuclides around the second r-process peak (A130), and the decay chain of 132Te (t1/2=3.21days) 132I (t1/2=0.10days) 132Xe produces gamma-ray lines at 228 keV, 668 keV, and 773 keV. For the case of a wind ejecta with Ye0.30, the dominant contributors of gamma-ray energy are the nuclides around the first r-process peak (A80), and the decay chain of 72Zn (t1/2=1.93days) 72Ga (t1/2=0.59days) 72Ge produces gamma-ray lines at 145 keV, 834 keV, 2202 keV, and 2508 keV. The peak fluxes of these lines are, which are marginally detectable with the next-generation MeV gamma-ray detector \emph{ETCC} if the source is at a distance of 40Mpc.

title: To investigate the magnetic-field-induced distortion of NSs through GRB X-ray plateaus
authors: Tingting Lin, Shuang Du, Renxin Xu
topic: Magnetic field may distort neutron stars (NSs), but the effect has not been robustly tested through gravitational-wave observation yet due to the absence of a fast rotating Galactic magnetar. The central objects of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could be millisecond magnetars. Under the magnetar scenario on the X-ray plateaus of GRB afterglows,the spindown evolution modulated by the gravitational-wave radiation may be inferred from some special samples,so that the magnetically-induced distorting can be further estimated. According to two samples, GRB 060807 and GRB 070521, we found that the correlation between the effective ellipticity, epsB,eff, and effective magnetic field, Beff, is espB,eff010-4(Beff1014G)2. This result demands that Beff-0.01Bt with Bt being the internal toroidal magnetic field strength of NSs. We suggested that the nonzero moment of force generated during few massive-star collapses may induce differential rotation between the interior and exterior of the proto-NS to amplify the internal toroidal field.

title: Insights into non-axisymmetric instabilities in three-dimensional rotating supernova models with neutrino and gravitational-wave signatures
authors: Tomoya Takiwaki, Kei Kotake, Thierry Foglizzo
topic: We present a detailed analysis to clarify what determines the growth of the \ltw instability in the context of rapidly rotating core-collapse of massive stars. To this end, we perform three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations of a 27Msun star including several updates in the general relativistic correction to gravity, the multi-energy treatment of heavy-lepton neutrinos, and the nuclear equation of state. Non-axisymmetric deformations are analyzed from the point of view of the time evolution of the pattern frequency and the corotation radius. The corotation radius is found to coincide with the convective layer in the proto neutron star (PNS). We propose a new mechanism to account for the growth of the \ltw instability in the CCSN environment. Near the convective boundary where a small \BV frequency is expected, Rossby waves propagating in the azimuthal direction at mid latitude induce non-axisymmetric unstable modes, in both hemispheres. They merge with each other and finally become the spiral arm in the equatorial plane. We also investigate how the growth of the \ltw instability impacts the neutrino and gravitational-wave signatures.

title: Measuring the contribution of neutron star-black hole mergers to the production of heavy metals
authors: Hsin-Yu Chen, Salvatore Vitale, Francois Foucart
topic: The origin of the heavy elements in the Universe is not fully determined. Neutron star-black hole (NSBH) and neutron star-neutron star mergers may both produce heavy elements via rapid neutron-capture process (r-process). We use the recent detection of gravitational waves from NSBHs, improved measurements of neutron star equation-of-state, and the most modern numerical simulations of the ejected materials from binary collisions to investigate the production of heavy elements from binary mergers. As the amount of ejecta depends on the mass and spin distribution of compact objects, as well as on the equation-of-state of neutron stars, we consider various models for these quantities, informed by gravitational-wave and pulsar data. We find that even in the most favorable model, neutron star-black hole mergers are unlikely to account for more than 77\% of the r-process elements in the local Universe. If black holes have preferentially small spins, this bound decreases to 35\%. Finally, if black hole spins are small and there is a dearth of low mass (less 5Msun) black holes in NSBH binaries, the NSBH contribution to r-process elements is negligible.

title: Multimessenger Analysis Strategy for Core-Collapse Supernova Search: Gravitational Waves and Low-energy Neutrinos
authors: Odysse Halim, Claudio Casentini, Marco Drago, Viviana Fafone, Kate Scholberg, Carlo Francesco Vigorito, Giulia Pagliaroli
topic: Core-collapse supernovae are fascinating astrophysical objects for multimessenger studies. Gravitational waves (GWs) are expected to play a role in the supernova explosion mechanism, but their modelling is also challenging due to the stochastic nature of the dynamics and the vast possible progenitors, and moreover, the GW detection from these objects is still elusive with the already advanced detectors. Low-energy neutrinos will be emitted enormously during the core-collapse explosion and can help for the gravitational wave counterpart search. In this work we develop a multi-messenger strategy to search for such astrophysical objects by exploiting a global network of both low-energy neutrino and gravitational wave detectors. First, we discuss how to improve the detection potential of the neutrino sub-network by exploiting the temporal behaviour of a neutrino burst from a core-collapse supernova. We show that with the proposed approach neutrino detectors can gain at least 10% of detection efficiency at the distance where their efficiency drops. Then, we combine the information provided by GW and neutrino in a multimessenger strategy. In particular, we obtain an increase of the probability to detect the GW signal from a CCSN at 60 kpc from zero when using only GW analysis to 33\% with our combined GW-nu approach.

title: Jitter radiation: towards TeV-photons of gamma-ray bursts
authors: Jirong Mao, Jiancheng Wang
topic: The synchrotron mechanism has the radiation limit of about 160 MeV, and it is not possible to explain the very high energy (VHE) photons that are emitted by high-energy objects. Inverse Compton scattering as a traditional process is applied for the explanation of the VHE emission. In this paper, jitter radiation, the relativistic electron radiation in the random and small-scale magnetic field, is proposed to be a possible mechanism to produce VHE photons. The jitter radiation frequency is associated with the perturbation field. The spectral index of the jitter radiation is dominated by the kinetic turbulence. We utilize the jitter radiation to explain the gamma-ray burst (GRB 190114C and GRB 180720B) VHE emissions that were recently detected by the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. We suggest that this mechanism can be applied to other kinds of VHE sources.

title: Pair-Regulated Klein-Nishina Relativistic Magnetic Reconnection with Applications to Blazars and Accreting Black Holes
authors: J. M. Mehlhaff, G. R. Werner, D. A. Uzdensky, M. C. Begelman
topic: Relativistic magnetic reconnection is a powerful agent through which magnetic energy can be tapped in astrophysics, energizing particles that then produce observed radiation. In some systems, the highest energy photons come from particles Comptonizing an ambient radiation bath supplied by an external source. If the emitting particle energies are high enough, this inverse Compton (IC) scattering enters the Klein-Nishina regime, which differs from the low-energy Thomson IC limit in two significant ways. First, radiative losses become inherently discrete, with particles delivering an order-unity fraction of their energies to single photons. Second, Comptonized photons may pair-produce with the ambient radiation, opening up another channel for radiative feedback on magnetic reconnection. We analytically study externally illuminated highly magnetized reconnecting systems for which both of these effects are important. We identify a universal (initial magnetization-independent) quasi-steady state in which gamma-rays emitted from the reconnection layer are absorbed in the upstream region, and the resulting hot pairs dominate the energy density of the inflow plasma. However, a true pair cascade is unlikely, and the number density of created pairs remains subdominant to that of the original plasma for a wide parameter range. Future particle-in-cell simulation studies may test various aspects. Pair-regulated Klein-Nishina reconnection may explain steep spectra (quiescent and flaring) from flat-spectrum radio quasars and black hole accretion disc coronae.

title: Coherent Electromagnetic Emission from Relativistic Magnetized Shocks
authors: Lorenzo Sironi, Illya Plotnikov, Joonas Nättilä, Andrei M. Beloborodov
topic: Relativistic magnetized shocks are a natural source of coherent emission, offering a plausible radiative mechanism for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). We present first-principles 3D simulations that provide essential information for the FRB models based on shocks: the emission efficiency, spectrum, and polarization. The simulated shock propagates in an electron-position plasma with magnetization sigma \g 1. The measured fraction of shock energy converted to coherent radiation is 10-3-sigma-1, and the energy-carrying wavenumber of the wave spectrum is 4omega_c/c, where omega_c is the upstream gyrofrequency. The ratio of the O-mode and X-mode energy fluxes emitted by the shock is 0.4sigma-1. The dominance of the X-mode at sigma \gg1 is particularly strong, approaching 100\% in the spectral band around 2omega_c. We also provide a detailed description of the emission mechanism for both X- and O-modes.

title: The Lightweaver Framework for NLTE Radiative Transfer in Python
authors: Christopher M J Osborne, Ivan Milić
topic: Tools for computing detailed optically thick spectral line profiles out of local thermodynamic equilibrium have always been focused on speed, due to the large computational effort involved. With the Lightweaver framework, we have produced a more flexible, modular toolkit for building custom tools in a high-level language, Python, without sacrificing speed against the current state of the art. The goal of providing a more flexible method for constructing these complex simulations is to decrease the barrier to entry and allow more rapid exploration of the field. In this paper we present an overview of the theory of optically thick NLTE radiative transfer, the numerical methods implemented in Lightweaver including the problems of time-dependent populations and charge-conservation, as well as an overview of the components most users will interact with, to demonstrate their flexibility.

title: General-relativistic treatment of tidal g-mode resonances in coalescing binaries of neutron stars. II. As triggers for precursor flares of short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Hao-Jui Kuan, Arthur G. Suvorov, Kostas D. Kokkotas
topic: In some short gamma-ray bursts, precursor flares occurring ∼ seconds prior to the main episode have been observed. These flares may then be associated with the last few cycles of the inspiral when the orbital frequency is a few hundred Hz. During these final cycles, tidal forces can resonantly excite quasi-normal modes in the inspiralling stars, leading to a rapid increase in their amplitude. It has been shown that these modes can exert sufficiently strong strains onto the neutron star crust to instigate yieldings. Due to the typical frequencies of g-modes being ∼100 Hz, their resonances with the orbital frequency match the precursor timings and warrant further investigation. Adopting realistic equations of state and solving the general-relativistic pulsation equations, we study g-mode resonances in coalescing quasi-circular binaries, where we consider various stellar rotation rates, degrees of stratification, and magnetic field structures. We show that for some combination of stellar parameters, the resonantly excited g1- and g2-modes may lead to crustal failure and trigger precursor flares.

title: GRMHD simulations of BH activation by small scale magnetic loops: Formation of striped jets and active coronae
authors: Anna Chashkina, Omer Bromberg, Amir Levinson
topic: We have performed a series of numerical experiments aimed at studying the activation of Kerr black holes (BHs) by advection of small scale magnetic fields. Such configurations may potentially give rise to the formation of quasi-striped Blandford-Znajek jets. It can also lead to enhanced dissipation and generation of plasmoids in current sheets formed in the vicinity of the BH horizon, which may constitute a mechanism to power the hard X-ray emission seen in many accreting BH systems (a la lamppost models). Our analysis suggests that formation of quasi-striped jets with significant power may be possible provided loops with alternating polarity having sizes larger than 10rg or so can be maintained (either form sporadically or advected from outside) at a radius 102rg. This conclusion is consistent with recent results of general relativistic force-free simulations. We also find that the accretion dynamics exhibits cyclic behaviour in MAD states, alternating between high accretion phases and quenched accretion phases during which the magnetosphere becomes force-free out to radii 10rg. We suggest that such a behaviour should lead to notable variations of the observed luminosity and image of the inner disc (BH shadow image). Finally, we find that the transition between accreted loops on the BH gives rise to the formation of current sheets and energetic plasmoids on the jet boundary during intermittent periods when the jet becomes inactive, in addition to an equatorial current sheet that forms during peaks in the jet activity.

title: Merger of a Neutron Star with a Black Hole: one-family vs. two-families scenario
authors: Francesco Di Clemente, Alessandro Drago, Giuseppe Pagliara
topic: A kilonova signal is generally expected after a Black Hole - Neutron Star merger. The strength of the signal is related to the equation of state of neutron star matter and it increases with the stiffness of the latter. The recent results obtained by NICER suggest a rather stiff equation of state and the expected kilonova signal is therefore strong, at least if the mass of the Black Hole does not exceed 10msun. We compare the predictions obtained by considering equations of state of neutron star matter satisfying the most recent observations and assuming that only one family of compact stars exists with the results predicted in the two-families scenario. In the latter a soft hadronic equation of state produces very compact stellar objects while a rather stiff quark matter equation of state produces massive strange quark stars, satisfying NICER results. The expected kilonova signal in the two-families scenario is very weak: the Strange Quark Star - Black Hole merger does not produce a kilonova signal because, according to simulations, the amount of mass ejected is negligible and the Hadronic Star - Black Hole merger produces a much weaker signal than in the one-family scenario because the hadronic equation of state is very soft. This prediction will be easily tested with the new generation of detectors.

title: Probing the progenitors of spinning binary black-hole mergers with long gamma-ray bursts
authors: Simone S. Bavera, Tassos Fragos, Emmanouil Zapartas et al
topic: Long gamma-ray bursts are associated with the core-collapse of massive, rapidly spinning stars. However, the believed efficient angular momentum transport in stellar interiors leads to predominantly slowly-spinning stellar cores. Here, we report on binary stellar evolution and population synthesis calculations, showing that tidal interactions in close binaries not only can explain the observed sub-population of spinning, merging binary black holes, but also lead to long gamma-ray bursts at the time of black-hole formation, with rates matching the empirical ones. We find that 10% of the GWTC-2 reported binary black holes had a long gamma-ray burst associated with their formation, with GW190517 and GW190719 having a probability of 85%, respectively, being among them.

title: Constraints on Equivalence Principle Violation from Gamma Ray Bursts
authors: Deaglan J. Bartlett, Dexter Bergsdal, Harry Desmond, Pedro G. Ferreira, Jens Jasche
topic: Theories of gravity that obey the Weak Equivalence Principle have the same Parametrised Post-Newtonian parameter gamma for all particles at all energies. The large Shapiro time delays of extragalactic sources allow us to put tight constraints on differences in gamma between photons of different frequencies from spectral lag data, since a non-zero Δγ would result in a frequency-dependent arrival time. The majority of previous constraints have assumed that the Shapiro time delay is dominated by a few local massive objects, although this is a poor approximation for distant sources. In this work we consider the cosmological context of these sources by developing a source-by-source, Monte Carlo-based forward model for the Shapiro time delays by combining constrained realisations of the local density field using the BORG algorithm with unconstrained large-scale modes. Propagating uncertainties in the density field reconstruction and marginalising over an empirical model describing other contributions to the time delay, we use spectral lag data of Gamma Ray Bursts from the BATSE satellite to constrain confidence between photon energies of 25keV and 325keV.

topic: We report the observation of gravitational waves from two compact binary coalescences in LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run with properties consistent with neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries. The two events are named GW200105 162426 and GW200115 042309, abbreviated as GW200105 and GW200115; the first was observed by LIGO Livingston and Virgo, and the second by all three LIGO-Virgo detectors. The source of GW200105 has component masses 8.9+1.2-1.5Msun and 1.9+0.3-0.2Msun, whereas the source of GW200115 has component masses 5.7+1.8-2.1Msun and 1.5+0.7-0.3Msun (all measurements quoted at the 90\% credible level). The probability that the secondary's mass is below the maximal mass of a neutron star is 89%-96% and 87%-98%, respectively, for GW200105 and GW200115, with the ranges arising from different astrophysical assumptions. The source luminosity distances are 280+110-110 Mpc and 300+150-100 Mpc, respectively. The magnitude of the primary spin of GW200105 is less than 0.23 at the 90% credible level, and its orientation is unconstrained. For GW200115, the primary spin has a negative spin projection onto the orbital angular momentum at 88% probability. We are unable to constrain spin or tidal deformation of the secondary component for either event. We infer a NSBH merger rate density of 45+75-33Gpc-3yr-1 when assuming GW200105 and GW200115 are representative of the NSBH population, or 130+112-69Gpc-3yr-1 under the assumption of a broader distribution of component masses.

title: DDOTI Observations of Gravitational-Wave Sources Discovered in O3

topic: We present optical follow-up observations with the DDOTI telescope of gravitational-wave events detected during the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo O3 observing run. DDOTI is capable of responding to an alert in a few minutes, has an instantaneous field of about 69 deg2, and obtains 10sigma upper limits of wlim=18.5 to 20.5 AB mag in 1000s of exposure, depending on the conditions. We observed 54\% (26 out of 48) of the unretracted gravitational-wave alerts and did not find any electromagnetic counterparts. We compare our upper limits to various possible counterparts: the kilonova AT2017gfo, models of radioactive- and magnetar-powered kilonovae, short gamma-ray burst afterglows, and AGN flares. Although the large positional uncertainties of GW sources do not allow us to place strong constraints during O3, DDOTI observations of well-localized GW events in O4 and beyond could meaningfully constrain models of compact binary mergers. We show that DDOTI is able to detect kilonovae similar to AT2017gfo up to about 200Mpc and magnetar-powered kilonovae up to 1Gpc. We calculate that nearby (less200 Mpc) afterglows have a high chance (70\%) to be detected by rapid (less3 hours) DDOTI observations if observed on-axis, whereas off-axis afterglows are unlikely to be seen. Finally, we suggest that long-term monitoring of massive BBH events with DDOTI could confirm or rule out late AGN flares associated with these events.

title: Exploring the GRB population: Robust afterglow modelling
authors: M. D. Aksulu, R. A. M. J. Wijers, H. J. van Eerten, A. J. van der Horst
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are ultra-relativistic collimated outflows, which emit synchrotron radiation throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum when they interact with their environment. This afterglow emission enables us to probe the dynamics of relativistic blast waves, the microphysics of shock acceleration, and environments of GRBs. We perform Bayesian inference on a sample of GRB afterglow data sets consisting of 22 long GRBs and 4 short GRBs, using the afterglow model "scalefit", which is based on 2D relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. We make use of Gaussian processes to account for systematic deviations in the data sets, which allows us to obtain robust estimates for the model parameters. We present the inferred parameters for the sample of GRBs, and make comparisons between short GRBs and long GRBs in constant-density and stellar-wind-like environments. We find that in almost all respects such as energy and opening angle, short and long GRBs are statistically the same. Short GRBs however have a markedly lower prompt gamma-ray emission efficiency than long GRBs. We also find that for long GRBs in ISM-like ambient media there is a significant anti-correlation between the fraction of thermal energy in the magnetic fields, ϵB, and the beaming corrected kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find no evidence that the mass-loss rates of the progenitor stars are lower than those of typical Wolf-Rayet stars.

title: Twin stars: probe of phase transition from hadronic to quark matter
authors: T. Deloudis, P.S. Koliogiannis, Ch.C. Moustakidis
topic: In agreement with the gravitational-wave events which are constantly increasing, new aspects of the internal structure of compact stars have come to light. A scenario in which a first order transition takes place inside these stars is of particular interest as it can lead, under conditions, to a third gravitationally stable branch (besides white dwarfs and neutron stars). This is known as the twin star scenario. The new branch yields stars with the same mass as normal compact stars but quite different radii. In the current work, we focus on hybrid stars undergone a hadron to quark phase transition near their core and how this new stable configuration arises. Emphasis is to be given especially in the aspects of the phase transition and its parameterization in two different ways, namely with Maxwell construction and with Gibbs construction. Qualitative findings of mass-radius relations of these stars will also be presented.

title: The content of astrophysical jets
authors: Gustavo E. Romero
topic: Jets, collimated outflows of particles and fields, are observed in a wide variety of astrophysical systems, including Active Galactic Nuclei of various types, microquasars, gamma-ray bursts, and young stellar objects. Despite intensive efforts along several decades of observational and theoretical research, there are still many uncertainties and open questions related to how jets are produced and what is their composition. In this review I offer an outline of some current views on the content and basic properties of astrophysical jets.

title: Magneto-elastic equilibrium of a neutron-star crust
authors: Yasufumi Kojima, Shota Kisaka, Kotaro Fujisawa
topic: We examine the equilibrium of a magnetized neutron-star-crust. We calculate axially symmetric models in which an elastic force balances solenoidal motion driven by a Lorentz force. A large variety of equilibrium models are allowed by incorporating the elastic shear deformation; in addition, toroidal-magnetic-field dominated models are available. These results remarkably differ from those in barotropic fluid stars. We demonstrate some models wherein the magnetic energy exceeds the elastic energy. The excess comes from the fact that a large amount of magnetic energy is associated with the irrotational part of the magnetic force, which is balanced with gravity and pressure. It is sufficient for equilibrium models that the minor solenoidal part is balanced by a weak elastic force. We find that the elasticity in the crust plays an important role on the magnetic-field confinement. Further, we present the spatial distribution of the shear-stress at the elastic limit, by which the crust-fracture location can be identified. The result has useful implications for realistic crust-quake models.

title: Standardized long gamma-ray bursts as a cosmic distance indicator
authors: F. Y. Wang, J. P. Hu, G. Q. Zhang, Z. G. Dai
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous explosions and can be detectable out to the edge of Universe. It has long been thought they can extend the Hubble diagram to very high redshifts. Several correlations between temporal or spectral properties and GRB luminosities have been proposed to make GRBs cosmological tools. However, those correlations cannot be properly standardized. In this paper, we select a long GRB sample with X-ray plateau phases produced by electromagnetic dipole emissions from central new-born magnetars. A tight correlation is found between the plateau luminosity and the end time of the plateau in X-ray afterglows out to the redshift z=5.91. We standardize these long GRBs X-ray light curves to a universal behavior by this correlation for the first time, with a luminosity dispersion of 0.5 dex. The derived distance-redshift relation of GRBs is in agreement with the standard ΛCDM model both at low and high redshifts. The evidence of accelerating universe from this GRB sample is 3sigma, which is the highest statistical significance from GRBs to date.

title: Highly r-process enhanced stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies
authors: Myoungwon Jeon, Gurtina Besla, Volker Bromm
topic: Highly r-process enhanced metal-poor stars have been observed in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy, specifically in ReticulumII (RetII). The fact that only a few UFDs contain such stars implies that the r-process site may reflect very rare, but individually prolific events, such as neutron star mergers (NSMs). Considering the relatively short star formation history (SFH) of UFDs, it is puzzling how they could experience such a rare phenomenon. In this work, we show the results of cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of isolated UFDs to explain the formation of MP r-II stars in UFDs. We employ a simple toy model for NSM events, adopting parameters consistent with observations, such as the NSM rate and europium (Eu) mass (MEu=10-5 solar mass). We identify only one simulated galaxy with abundances similar to RetII in a simulation volume that hosts 30 UFD analogs, indicating that such abundances are possible but rare. By exploring a range of key parameters, we demonstrate that the most important factor in determining the formation of MP r-II stars in UFDs is how quickly subsequent stars can be formed out of r-process enriched gas. We find that it takes between 10 to 100Myr to form the first and second burst of MP r-II stars. Over this period, Eu-polluted gas maintains the required high abundance ratios.

title: Influence of the crust on the neutron star macrophysical quantities and universal relations
authors: Lami Suleiman, Morgane Fortin, Julian Leszek Zdunik, Pawel Haensel
topic: Measurements of neutron-star macrophysical properties thanks to multimessenger observations offer the possibility to constrain the properties of nuclear matter. Indeed cold and dense matter as found inside neutron stars, in particular in their core, is not accessible to terrestrial laboratories.We investigate the consequences of using equations of state that employ models for the core and the crust that are not calculated consistently on the neutron-star macrophysical properties, on some of the so-called universal relations and on the constraints obtained from gravitational-wave observations. We use various treatments found in the literature to connect together nonconsistent core and crust equations of state. We then compute the mass, the radius, the tidal deformability, and the moment of inertia for each model. Finally, we assess the discrepancies in the neutron-star macrophysical properties obtained when consistent models for the whole star and nonconsistent ones are employed. The use of crust models nonconsistent with the core introduces an error on the macrophysical parameters which can be as large as the estimated accuracy of current and next generation telescopes. The precision of some of the universal relations reported in the literature is found to be overestimated. We confirm that the equation of the crust has limited influence on the macrophysical properties. The discrepancy between results obtained for a fully consistent equation of state and a nonconsistent one can be reduced if one connects the core and the crust models at baryon densities around 0.08-0.1 fm−3. The equation of the crust cannot be probed with current multimessenger observations and near-future ones.

title: Gamma-Ray Burst in a Binary System
authors: Ze-Cheng Zou, Bin-Bin Zhang, Yong-Feng Huang, Xiao-Hong Zhao
topic: Typical models of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) assume that they happen in isolated central engine systems, with little attention being paid to the fact that most stars (including those evolving as GRB progenitors) are in binary or multi-body systems. This paper will study in detail the observational effects when a GRB occurs in a binary system. We show that the blockage by the companion star becomes nonnegligible when it is located within a typical GRB jet opening angle (e.g., 10 degrees) and at an orbit of 67 au, assuming the GRB emission site is at 1015 cm radius. In such a case, an on-axis observer will see a GRB with a similar temporal behavior but 25% dimmer. On the other hand, an off-axis observer outside the jet opening angle (hence missed the original GRB) can see a delayed "reflected" GRB, which is much fainter in brightness, much wider in the temporal profile and slightly softer in energy. Our study can naturally explain the origin of some low-luminosity GRBs. Moreover, we also point out that the companion star may be shocked if it is located inside the GRB emission site, which can give rise to an X-ray transient or a GRB followed by a delayed X-ray bump on top of X-ray afterglows.

title: Revisiting neutron starquakes caused by spin-down
authors: J. A. Rencoret, C. Aguilera-Gómez, A. Reisenegger
topic: Pulsars show a steady decrease in their rotational frequency, occasionally interrupted by sudden spin-ups called glitches, whose physical origin is still a mystery. One suggested explanation for at least the small glitches are starquakes, i.e., failures of the solid neutron star crust, in which the progressive reduction of the centrifugal force deforms the star, stressing the solid until it breaks. This produces a spin-up, dissipating energy inside the star. We explore this suggestion by analyzing a mostly analytical model in order to understand the possible consequences of starquakes, particularly whether they can explain at least the small glitches. We analyze the deformations and strains produced by the decreasing centrifugal force, modeling the neutron star with a fluid core and a solid crust, each with uniform density and with the core possibly denser than the crust. The deformation of a star with very different densities in the core and crust is qualitatively different from the previously studied case of equal densities. The former more closely resembles the behavior of a fluid star, in which the core-crust interface is a surface of constant gravitational plus centrifugal potential. Regardless of the uncertain breaking strain, the glitch activity in this model is several orders of magnitude smaller than observed, even if only small glitches are considered. For a large breaking strain, suggested by simulations, glitches due to starquakes could be roughly of the correct size, but much less frequent than observed glitches. The energy released in each such glitch is much larger than in the standard model of angular momentum transfer from a faster rotating superfluid in the inner crust. We also confirm that stresses in the crust can in principle support an ellipticity much larger than some observational upper limits from pulsar timing and continuous gravitational wave searches.

title: The formation of heavy, radio-quiet neutron star binaries and the origin of GW190425
authors: Alejandro Vigna-Gómez, Sophie L. Schrøder, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, David R. Aguilera-Dena, Aldo Batta, Norbert Langer, Reinhold Wilcox
topic: The detection of the unusually heavy binary neutron star merger GW190425 marked a stark contrast to the mass distribution from known Galactic millisecond pulsars in neutron star binaries and gravitational-wave source GW170817. We suggest here a formation channel for heavy binary neutron stars in which massive helium stars, assembled after common envelope, remain compact and avoid mass transfer onto the neutron star companion and thus evade pulsar recycling. In particular we present three-dimensional simulations of the supernova explosion of the massive stripped helium star and follow the mass fallback evolution and the subsequent accretion onto the neutron star companion. We find that fallback leads to significant mass growth in the newly formed neutron star and that the companion does not accrete sufficient mass to become a millisecond pulsar. This can explain the formation of heavy binary neutron star systems such as GW190425, as well as predict the assembly of neutron star - light black hole systems. Moreover, this hints to the existence of a sizable population of radio-quiet double compact objects in our Galaxy. Finally, this formation avenue is consistent with the observed mass-eccentricity correlation of binary neutron stars in the Milky Way.

title: GRB afterglow parameters in the era of TeV observations: the case of GRB190114C
authors: Evgeny Derishev, Tsvi Piran
topic: The afterglow of GRB190114C has been observed at {60-1200s} after the burst in the {sub-TeV range} by the {MAGIC Cherenkov} telescope. The simultaneous observations in X-ray range, which is presumed to be of synchrotron origin, and in sub-TeV range, where the emission is presumed to be inverse Compton, provide new stringent constraints on the conditions within the emitting regions {and their evolution in time}. While the additional data contain a lot of new information, it turns out that fitting both the X-ray and the TeV emission, is much more complicated than what was originally anticipated. We find that optical flux measurements provide important complementary information that in combination with TeV measurements breaks degeneracy in the parameter space. We present here a numerical fit to the multi-wavelength observed spectrum using a new code that calculates the single-zone synchrotron including self-Compton emission taking into account the exact Klein-Nishina cross-sections as well as pair production via absorption of the high-energy photons inside the emitting zone and the emission from the resulting secondary pairs. We also present a revised set of single zone parameters and a method for fitting the data to the observations. Our model for GRB190114C that fits all the observations, from the optical data point to the sub-TeV range, suggests that it is in the fast cooling regime. The inferred parameters for observations {at two separate moments of time} show significant deviations from some of the common expectations in afterglow modeling but are all consistent with the predictions of the {pair-balance} model.

title: Studying VLOCV twin compact stars with binary mergers
authors: Z. Sharifi, M. Bigdeli, D. Alvarez-Castillo
topic: GW170817 has provided valuable constraints on the equations of state of merging binary neutron stars, which can be considered as the most probable candidate for the source of gravitational waves. On the other hand, these natural laboratories of extreme temperature and density may lead to the estimation of some exotic matter like {deconfined quark matter in their cores}. In this paper, we investigate the neutron star matter equation of state (EoS) with the lowest order constrained variational (LOCV) method considering the excluded volume effect (VLOCV) for nucleons {to} compute the tidal deformability of binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs). Within this approach, the size of nucleons makes the EoS {so} stiff that requires a phase transition in order to avoid causality violation. Therefore, this phase transition {may lead} to the appearance of the third family of compact stars {including} twin star configurations. {Our EoS models are confronted with observations from GW170817, GW190814, GW190425, and also NICER. We find out that regarding all these constraints, the EoS models having the {transition} pressure=30-100 MeV/fm3 and the energy density discontinuity Δε≲300 MeV/fm3 are preferable.

authors: N. Jordana-Mitjans, C. G. Mundell, R. J. Smith, C. Guidorzi, M. Marongiu, S. Kobayashi, A. Gomboc, M. Shrestha, I. A. Steele
topic: We report the earliest-ever detection of optical polarization from a GRB forward shock (GRB 141220A), measured 129.5-204.3s after the burst using the multi-colour RINGO3 optical polarimeter on the 2-m fully autonomous robotic Liverpool Telescope. The temporal decay gradient of the optical light curves from 86s to 2200s post-burst is typical of classical forward shocks with alpha=1.091 The low optical polarization PBV=2.8+2.0-1.6\% t mean time 168s post-burst is compatible with being induced by the host galaxy dust, leaving low polarization intrinsic to the GRB emission itself -- as theoretically predicted for forward shocks and consistent with previous detections of low degrees of optical polarization in GRB afterglows observed hours to days after the burst. The current sample of early-time polarization data from forward shocks suggests polarization from (a) the Galactic and host galaxy dust properties (b) contribution from a polarized reverse shock (GRB deceleration time, jet magnetization) or (c) forward shock intrinsic polarization, which depends on the magnetic field coherence length scale and the size of the observable emitting region (burst energetics, circumburst density).

title: High-frequency radio synchrotron maser emission from relativistic shocks
authors: Dmitry Khangulyan, Maxim V. Barkov, Sergey B. Popov
topic: We study the conditions required for the production of the synchrotron maser emission downstream of a relativistic shock. We show that for weakly magnetized shocks, synchrotron maser emission can be generated at frequencies significantly exceeding the relativistic gyrofrequency. This high-frequency maser emission seems to be the most suitable for interpreting peculiar GHz radio sources. To illustrate this, we consider a magnetar flare model for FRBs. Our analysis shows that the maser emission is radiated away from the central magnetar, which guarantees a short duration of bursts independently of the shock wave radius. If FRBs are produced by the high-frequency maser emission then one can significantly relax the requirements for several key parameters: the magnetic field strength at the production site, luminosity of the flare, and the production site bulk Lorentz factor. To check the feasibility of this model, we study the statistical relation between powerful magnetar flares and the rate of FRBs. The expected ratio is derived by convoluting the redshift-dependent magnetar density with their flare luminosity function above the energy limit determined by the FRB detection threshold. We obtain that only a small fraction, \(\sim10^{-5}\), of powerful magnetar flares trigger FRBs. This ratio agrees surprisingly well with our estimates: we obtained that \(10\%\) of magnetars should be in the evolutionary phase suitable for the production of FRBs, and only \(10^{-4}\) of all flares are expected to be weakly magnetized, which is a necessary condition for the high-frequency maser emission.

title: Gravitational waves HI intensity mapping: cosmological and astrophysical applications
authors: Giulio Scelfo, Marta Spinelli, Alvise Raccanelli, Lumen Boco, Andrea Lapi, Matteo Viel
topic: Two of the most rapidly growing observables in cosmology and astrophysics are gravitational waves (GW) and the neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution. In this work, we investigate the cross-correlation between resolved gravitational wave detections and HI signal from intensity mapping (IM) experiments. By using a tomographic approach with angular power spectra, including all projection effects, we explore possible applications of the combination of the Einstein Telescope and the SKAO intensity mapping surveys. We focus on three main topics: \textit{(i)} statistical inference of the observed redshift distribution of GWs; \textit{(ii)} constraints on dynamical dark energy models as an example of cosmological studies; \textit{(iii)} determination of the nature of the progenitors of merging binary black holes, distinguishing between primordial and astrophysical origin. Our results show that: \textit{(i)} the GW redshift distribution can be calibrated with good accuracy at low redshifts, without any assumptions on cosmology or astrophysics, potentially providing a way to probe astrophysical and cosmological models; \textit{(ii)} the constrains on the dynamical dark energy parameters are competitive with IM-only experiments, in a complementary way and potentially with less systematics; \textit{(iii)} it will be possible to detect a relatively small abundance of primordial black holes within the gravitational waves from resolved mergers. Our results extend towards GWxIM the promising field of multi-tracing cosmology and astrophysics, which has the major advantage of allowing scientific investigations in ways that would not be possible by looking at single observables separately.

title: Equation of State Dependence of Gravitational Waves in Core-Collapse Supernovae
authors: Oliver Eggenberger Andersen, Shuai Zha, André da Silva Schneider, Aurore Betranhandy, Sean M. Couch, Evan P. O'Connor
topic: Gravitational waves (GWs) provide unobscured insight into the birthplace of neutron stars (NSs) and black holes in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). The nuclear equation of state (EOS) describing these dense environments is yet uncertain, and variations in its prescription affect the proto-neutron star (PNS) and the post-bounce dynamics in CCSNe simulations, subsequently impacting the GW emission. We perform axisymmetric simulations of CCSNe with Skyrme-type EOSs to study how the GW signal and PNS convection zone are impacted by two experimentally accessible EOS parameters, (1) the effective mass of nucleons, which is crucial in setting the thermal dependence of the EOS, and (2) the isoscalar incompressibility modulus. While Ksat shows little impact, the peak frequency of the GWs has a strong effective mass dependence due to faster contraction of the PNS for higher values of owing to a decreased thermal pressure. These more compact PNSs also exhibit more neutrino heating which drives earlier explosions and correlates with the GW amplitude via accretion plumes striking the PNS, exciting the oscillations. We investigate the spatial origin of the GWs and show the agreement between a frequency-radial distribution of the GW emission and a perturbation analysis. We do not rule out overshoot from below via PNS convection as another moderately strong excitation mechanism in our simulations. We also study the combined effect of effective mass and rotation. In all our simulations we find evidence for a power gap near 1250 Hz, we investigate its origin and report its EOS dependence.

topic: The physical properties of fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies provide important clues towards the nature of FRB sources. The 16 FRB hosts identified thus far span three orders of magnitude in mass and specific star-formation rate, implicating a ubiquitously occurring progenitor object. FRBs localised with arcsecond accuracy also enable effective searches for associated multi-wavelength and multi-timescale counterparts, such as the persistent radio source associated with FRB 20121102A. Here we present a localisation of the repeating source FRB 20201124A, and its association with a host galaxy (SDSS J050803.48+260338.0, z=0.098) and persistent radio source. The galaxy is massive (3x1010Msun), star-forming (few solar masses per year), and dusty. Very Large Array and Very Long Baseline Array observations of the persistent radio source measure a luminosity of 1.2x1029 erg s-1 Hz-1, and show that is extended on scales 50 mas. We associate this radio emission with the ongoing star-formation activity in SDSS J050803.48+260338.0. Deeper, more detailed observations are required to better utilise the milliarcsecond-scale localisation of FRB 20201124A reported from the European VLBI Network, and determine the origin of the large dispersion measure (150-220 pc cm-3) contributed by the host. SDSS J050803.48+260338.0 is an order of magnitude more massive than any galaxy or stellar system previously associated with a repeating FRB source, but is comparable to the hosts of so far non-repeating FRBs, further building the link between the two apparent populations.

These electromagnetic waves may be observable as a fast radio afterglow, with decreasing frequency and intensity. We demonstrate the fast coherent afterglow in a numerical experiment. We tentatively predict the peak afterglow frequency decreasing with time as.

title: A Neutron Star is born
authors: Débora Peres Menezes
topic: A neutron star was first detected as a pulsar in 1967. It is one of the most mysterious compact objects in the universe, with a radius of the order of 10 km and masses that can reach two solar masses. In fact, neutron stars are star remnants, a kind of stellar zombies (they die, but do not disappear). In the last decades, astronomical observations yielded various contraints for the neutron star masses and finally, in 2017, a gravitational wave was detected (GW170817). Its source was identified as the merger of two neutron stars coming from NGC 4993, a galaxy 140 million light years away from us. The very same event was detected in γ-ray, x-ray, UV, IR, radio frequency and even in the optical region of the electromagnetic spectrum, starting the new era of multi-messenger astronomy. To understand and describe neutron stars, an appropriate equation of state that satisfies bulk nuclear matter properties is necessary. GW170817 detection contributed with extra constraints to determine it. On the other hand, magnetars are the same sort of compact objects, but bearing much stronger magnetic fields that can reach up to 1015 G on the surface as compared with the usual 1012 G present in ordinary pulsars. While the description of ordinary pulsars is not completely established, describing magnetars poses extra challenges. In this paper, I give an overview on the history of neutron stars and on the development of nuclear models and show how the description of the tiny world of the nuclear physics can help the understanding of the cosmos, especially of the neutron stars.

title: Magnetospheres of black hole-neutron star binaries
authors: Federico Carrasco, Masaru Shibata, Oscar Reula
topic: We perform force-free simulations for a neutron star orbiting a black hole, aiming at clarifying the main magnetosphere properties of such binaries towards their innermost stable circular orbits. Several configurations are explored, varying the orbital separation, the individual spins and misalignment angle among the magnetic and orbital axes. We find significant electromagnetic luminosities, (depending on the specific setting), primarily powered by the orbital kinetic energy, being about one order of magnitude higher than those expected from unipolar induction. The systems typically develop current sheets that extend to long distances following a spiral arm structure. The intense curvature of the black hole produces extreme bending on a particular set of magnetic field lines as it moves along the orbit, leading to magnetic reconnections in the vicinity of the horizon. For the most symmetric scenario (aligned cases), these reconnection events can release large-scale plasmoids that carry the majority of the Poynting fluxes. On the other hand, for misaligned cases, a larger fraction of the luminosity is instead carried outwards by large-amplitude Alfv{é}n waves disturbances. We estimate possible precursor electromagnetic emissions based on our numerical solutions, finding radio signals as the most promising candidates to be detectable within distances of ≲200\,Mpc by forthcoming facilities like the Square Kilometer Array.

title: Exploring the spectral properties of radio relics I: Integrated spectral index and Mach number
authors: Denis Wittor, Stefano Ettori, Franco Vazza, Kamlesh Rajpurohit, Matthias Hoeft, Paola Domínguez-Fernández
topic: Radio relics are the manifestation of electrons presumably being shock (re-)accelerated to high energies in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. However, estimates of the shocks' strength yield different results when measured with radio or X-ray observations. In general, Mach numbers obtained from radio observations are larger than the corresponding X-ray measurements. In this work, we investigate this Mach number discrepancy. For this purpose, we used the cosmological code ENZO to simulate a sample of galaxy clusters that host bright radio relics. For each relic, we computed the radio Mach number from the integrated radio spectrum and the X-ray Mach number from the X-ray surface brightness and temperature jumps. Our analysis suggests that the differences in the Mach number estimates follow from the way in which different observables are related to different parts of the underlying Mach number distribution: radio observations are more sensistive to the high Mach numbers present only in a small fraction of a shock's surface, while X-ray measurements reflect the average of the Mach number distribution. Moreover, X-ray measurements are very sensitive to the relic's orientation. If the same relic is observed from different sides, the measured X-ray Mach number varies significantly. On the other hand, the radio measurements are more robust, as they are unaffected by the relic's orientation.

title: Diffusive Shock Acceleration by Multiple Weak Shocks
authors: Hyesung Kang
topic: The intracluster medium (ICM) is expected to experience on average about three passages of weak shocks with low sonic Mach numbers, during the formation of galaxy clusters. Both protons and electrons could be accelerated to become high energy cosmic rays (CRs) at such ICM shocks via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). We examine the effects of DSA by multiple shocks on the spectrum of accelerated CRs by including {\it in situ} injection/acceleration at each shock, followed by repeated re-acceleration at successive shocks in the test-particle regime. For simplicity, the accelerated particles are assumed to undergo adiabatic decompression without energy loss and escape from the system, before they encounter subsequent shocks. We show that in general the CR spectrum is flattened by multiple shock passages, compared to a single episode of DSA, and that the acceleration efficiency increases with successive shock passages. However, the decompression due to the expansion of shocks into the cluster outskirts may reduce the amplification and flattening of the CR spectrum by multiple shock passages. The final CR spectrum behind the last shock is determined by the accumulated effects of repeated re-acceleration by all previous shocks, but it is relatively insensitive to the ordering of the shock Mach numbers. Thus multiple passages of shocks may cause the slope of the CR spectrum to deviate from the canonical DSA power-law slope of the current shock.

title: Transport coefficients of hyperonic neutron star cores
authors: Peter Shternin, Isaac Vidaña
topic: We consider transport properties of the hypernuclear matter in neutron star cores. In particular, we calculate the thermal conductivity, the shear viscosity, and the momentum transfer rates for composition of dense matter in beta-equilibrium for baryon number densities in the range 0.1-1fm-3. The calculations are based on baryon interactions treated within the framework of the non-relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. Bare nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions are described by the Argonne v18 phenomenological potential supplemented with the Urbana IX three-nucleon force. Nucleon-hyperon (NY) and hyperon-hyperon (YY) interactions are based on the \new{NSC97e and NSC97a models} of the Nijmegen group. We find that the baryon contribution to transport coefficients is dominated by the neutron one as in the case of neutron star cores containing only nucleons. In particular, we find that neutrons dominate the total thermal conductivity over the whole range of densities explored and that, due to the onset of which leads to the deleptonization of the neutron star core, they dominate also the shear viscosity in the high density region, in contrast with the pure nucleonic case where the lepton contribution is always the dominant one.

topic: We present a novel universal relation for binary neutron star mergers with long-lived neutron star remnants: inspired by recent work based on numerical relativity simulations, we propose a novel approach using perturbative calculations that allow us to relate the pre-merger neutron star binary tidal deformability to the effective compactness of the post-merger remnant. Our results allow for the prediction of the stellar parameters of a long-lived remnant neutron star from the study of gravitational waves emitted during the pre-merger phase.

topic: Gamma-ray bursts - the most luminous explosions in the Universe - are produced as a result of cataclysmic events such as the collapse of a massive star or the merger of two neutron stars. We monitored the position of the close-by (about 370 Megaparsecs) gamma-ray burst GRB190829A, which originated from a massive star collapse, through very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations with the European VLBI Network and the Very Long Baseline Array, involving a total of 30 telescopes across four continents. We carried out a total of 9 observations between 9 and 117 days after the gamma-ray burst at 5 and 15 GHz, reaching an overall excellent resolution. From a state-of-the art analysis of these data, we obtained valuable information on the source size and expansion rate. The measurements are in remarkable agreement with the size evolution entailed by a detailed modelling of the multi-wavelength light curves with a forward plus reverse shock model, which agrees with the observations across almost 18 orders of magnitude in frequency (including the High Energy Stereoscopic System data at teraelectronvolt photon energies) and more than 4 orders of magnitude in time. Thanks to the multi-wavelength, high-cadence coverage of the afterglow, inherent degeneracies in the afterglow model are broken to a large extent, allowing us to capture some unique physical insights: we find a low prompt emission efficiency \leq 10-3; we constrain the fraction of electrons that are accelerated to relativistic speeds in the forward shock downstream to be \kappa_e \leq 13\% at the 90\% confidence level; we find that the magnetic field energy density in the reverse shock downstream must decay rapidly after the shock crossing.

title: The Gravity Collective: A Search for the Electromagnetic Counterpart to the Neutron Star-Black Hole Merger GW190814
authors: Charles D. Kilpatrick, David A. Coulter, Iair Arcavi, Thomas G. Brink, Georgios Dimitriadis, Alexei V. Filippenko, Ryan J. Foley, D. Andrew Howell, David O. Jones
topic: We present optical follow-up imaging obtained with the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope, Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network, Nickel Telescope, Swope Telescope, and Thacher Telescope of the LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave (GW) signal from the neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger GW190814. We searched the GW190814 localization region (19 deg2 for the 90th percentile best localization), covering a total of 51 deg2 and 94.6\% of the two-dimensional localization region. Analyzing the properties of 189 transients that we consider as candidate counterparts to the NSBH merger, including their localizations, discovery times from merger, optical spectra, likely host-galaxy redshifts, and photometric evolution, we conclude that none of these objects are likely to be associated with GW190814. Based on this finding, we consider the likely optical properties of an electromagnetic counterpart to GW190814, including possible kilonovae and short gamma-ray burst afterglows. Using the joint limits from our follow-up imaging, we conclude that a counterpart with an r-band decline rate of 0.68 mag day-1, similar to the kilonova AT 2017gfo, could peak at an absolute magnitude of at most -17.8 mag (50\% confidence). Our data are not constraining for ''red'' kilonovae and rule out ''blue'' kilonovae with M\g 0.5Msun (30\% confidence). We strongly rule out all known types of short gamma-ray burst afterglows with viewing angles \l 17 assuming an initial jet opening angle of 5.2deg and explosion energies and circumburst densities similar to afterglows explored in the literature. Finally, we explore the possibility that GW190814 merged in the disk of an active galactic nucleus, of which we find four in the localization region, but we do not find any candidate counterparts among these sources.

title: Synchrotron-Self-Compton radiation from magnetically-dominated turbulent plasmas in relativistic jets
authors: Emanuele Sobacchi, Lorenzo Sironi, Andrei M. Beloborodov
topic: Relativistic jets launched by rotating black holes are powerful emitters of non-thermal radiation. Extraction of the rotational energy via electromagnetic stresses produces magnetically-dominated jets, which may become turbulent. Studies of magnetically-dominated plasma turbulence from first principles show that most of the accelerated particles have small pitch angles, i.e. the particle velocity is nearly aligned with the local magnetic field. We examine synchrotron-self-Compton radiation from anisotropic particles in the fast cooling regime. The small pitch angles reduce the synchrotron cooling rate and promote the role of inverse Compton (IC) cooling, which can occur in two different regimes. In the Thomson regime, both synchrotron and IC components have soft spectra. In the Klein-Nishina regime, synchrotron radiation has a hard spectrum, over a broad range of frequencies. Our results have implications for the modelling of BL Lacs and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). BL Lacs produce soft synchrotron and IC spectra, as expected when Klein-Nishina effects are minor. The observed synchrotron and IC luminosities are typically comparable, which indicates a moderate anisotropy with pitch angles. Rare orphan gamma-ray flares may be produced when. The hard spectra of GRBs may be consistent with synchrotron radiation when the emitting particles are IC cooling in the Klein-Nishina regime, as expected for pitch angles. Blazar and GRB spectra can be explained by turbulent jets with a similar electron plasma magnetisation parameter, which for electron-proton plasmas corresponds to an overall magnetisation.

title: On accretion disks formed in MHD simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with accurate microphysics
authors: Elias R. Most, L. Jens Papenfort, Samuel D. Tootle, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: Remnant accretion disks formed in compact object mergers are an important ingredient in the understanding of electromagnetic afterglows of multi-messenger gravitational-wave events. Due to magnetically and neutrino driven winds, a significant fraction of the disk mass will eventually become unbound and undergo r-process nucleosynthesis. While this process has been studied in some detail, previous studies have typically used approximate initial conditions for the accretion disks, or started from purely hydrodynamical simulations. In this work, we analyse the properties of accretion disks formed from near equal-mass black hole-neutron star mergers simulated in general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in dynamical spacetimes with an accurate microphysical description. The post-merger systems were evolved until 120ms for different finite-temperature equations of state and black-hole spins. We present a detailed analysis of the fluid properties and of the magnetic-field topology. In particular, we provide analytic fits of the magnetic-field strength and specific entropy as a function of the rest-mass density, which can be used for the construction of equilibrium disk models. Finally, we evolve one of the systems for a total of 350ms after merger and study the prospect for eventual jet launching. While our simulations do not reach this stage, we find clear evidence of continued funnel magnetization and clearing, a prerequisite for any jet-launching mechanism.

title: Thermal irradiation induced wind outflow in a geometrically thin accretion disk: A hydrodynamic study
authors: Nagendra Kumar, Banibrata Mukhopadhyay 
topic: Many astrophysical sources, e.g., cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei, exhibit a wind outflow, when they reveal a multicolor blackbody spectrum, hence harboring a geometrically thin Keplerian accretion disk. Unlike an advective disk, in the thin disk, the physical environment, like, emission line, external heating, is expected to play a key role to drive the wind outflow. We show the wind outflow in a thin disk attributing a disk irradiation effect, probably from the inner to outer disks. We solve the set of steady, axisymmetric disk model equations in cylindrical coordinates along the vertical direction for a given launching radius (r) from the midplane, introducing irradiation as a parameter. We obtain an acceleration solution, for a finite irradiation in the presence of a fixed but tiny initial vertical velocity (hence thin disk properties practically do not alter) at the midplane, upto a maximum height (zmax). We find that wind outflow mainly occurs from the outer region of the disk and its density decreases with increasing launching radius, and for a given launching radius with increasing ejection height. Wind power decreases with increasing ejection height. For zmax \l 2r, wind outflow is ejected tangentially (or parallel to the disk midplane) in all directions with the fluid speed same as the azimuthal speed. This confirms mainly, for low mass X-ray binaries, (a) wind outflow should be preferentially observed in high-inclination sources, (b) the expectation of red and blue shifted absorption lines.

title: Self-similar solution of hot accretion flow: the role of kinematic viscosity coefficient
authors: Fatemeh Zahra Zeraatgari, Liquan Mei, Amin Mosallanezhad
topic: We investigate the dependency of the inflow-wind structure of the hot accretion flow on the kinematic viscosity coefficient. In this regard, we propose a model for the kinematic viscosity coefficient to mimic the behavior of the magnetorotational instability and would be maximal at the rotation axis. Then, we compare our model with two other prescriptions from numerical simulations of the accretion flow. We solve two-dimensional hydrodynamic equations of hot accretion flows in the presence of the thermal conduction. The self-similar approach is also adopted in the radial direction. We calculate the properties of the inflow and the wind such as velocity, density, angular momentum for three models of the kinematic viscosity prescription. On inspection, we find that in the model we suggested wind is less efficient than that in two other models to extract the angular momentum outward where the self-similar solutions are applied. The solutions obtained in this paper might be applicable to the hydrodynamical numerical simulations of the hot accretion flow.

title: The general applicability of self-similar solutions for thermal disc winds
authors: Andrew D. Sellek, Cathie J. Clarke, Richard A. Booth
topic: Thermal disc winds occur in many contexts and may be particularly important to the secular evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary discs heated by high energy radiation from their central star. In this paper we generalise previous models of self-similar thermal winds - which have self-consistent morphology and variation of flow variables - to the case of launch from an elevated base and to non-isothermal conditions. These solutions are well-reproduced by hydrodynamic simulations, in which, as in the case of isothermal winds launched from the mid-plane, we find winds launch at the maximum Mach number for which the streamline solutions extend to infinity without encountering a singularity. We explain this behaviour based on the fact that lower Mach number solutions do not fill the spatial domain. We also show that hydrodynamic simulations reflect the corresponding self-similar models across a range of conditions appropriate to photoevaporating protoplanetary discs, even when gravity, centrifugal forces, or changes in the density gradient mean the problem is not inherently scale free. Of all the parameters varied, the elevation of the wind base affected the launch velocity and flow morphology most strongly, with temperature gradients causing only minor differences. We explore how launching from an elevated base affects Ne II line profiles from winds, finding it increases (reduces) the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the line at low (high) inclination to the line of sight compared with models launched from the disc mid-plane and thus weakens the dependence of the FWHM on inclination.

title: HARM3D+NUC: A new method for simulating the post-merger phase of binary neutron star mergers with GRMHD, tabulated EOS and neutrino leakage
authors: Ariadna Murguia-Berthier, Scott C. Noble, Luke F. Roberts
topic: The first binary neutron star merger has already been detected in gravitational waves. The signal was accompanied by an electromagnetic counterpart including a kilonova component powered by the decay of radioactive nuclei, as well as a short gamma-ray burst. In order to understand the radioactively-powered signal, it is necessary to simulate the outflows and their nucleosynthesis from the post-merger disk. Simulating the disk and predicting the composition of the outflows requires general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations that include a realistic, finite-temperature equation of state (EOS) and self-consistently calculating the impact of neutrinos. In this work, we detail the implementation of a finite-temperature EOS and the treatment of neutrinos in the GRMHD code HARM3D+NUC, based on HARM3D. We include formal tests of both the finite-temperature EOS and the neutrino leakage scheme. We further test the code by showing that, given conditions similar to those of published remnant disks following neutron star mergers, it reproduces both recombination of free nucleons to a neutron-rich composition and excitation of a thermal wind.

title: Impact of the PSR J0740+6620 radius constraint on the properties of high-density matter
authors: Isaac Legred, Katerina Chatziioannou, Reed Essick, Sophia Han, Philippe Landry
topic: X-ray pulse profile modeling of PSR J0740+6620, the most massive known pulsar, by the NICER and XMM-Newton observatories recently led to a measurement of its radius. We investigate this measurement's implications for the neutron star equation of state, employing a nonparametric EoS model based on Gaussian processes and combining information from other X-ray, radio and gravitational-wave observations of neutron stars. Our analysis mildly disfavors equations of state that support a disconnected hybrid star branch in the mass-radius relation, a proxy for strong phase transitions, with a Bayes factor of 6.4. For EoSs with multiple stable branches, the transition mass from the hadronic to the hybrid branch is constrained to lie outside (1,2) Msum. We also find that the conformal sound-speed bound is violated inside neutron star cores, implying that core matter is strongly interacting. The squared sound speed reaches a maximum of 0.79+0.21-0.26c2 at 3.51+2.30-1.76 times nuclear saturation density at 90\% credibility. Since all but the gravitational-wave observations prefer a relatively stiff EoS, PSR J0740+6620's central density is only 3.0+1.6−1.6 times nuclear saturation, limiting the density range probed by observations of cold, nonrotating neutron stars in beta-equilibrium.

authors: Mahito Sasada, Yousuke Utsumi, Ryosuke Itoh, Nozomu Tominaga, Masaomi Tanaka, Tomoki Morokuma, Kenshi Yanagisawa et al
topic: The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration (LVC) sent out 56 gravitational-wave (GW) notices during the third observing run (O3). Japanese collaboration for Gravitational wave ElectroMagnetic follow-up (J-GEM) performed optical and near-infrared observations to identify and observe an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We constructed web-based system which enabled us to obtain and share information of candidate host galaxies for the counterpart, and status of our observations. Candidate host galaxies were selected from the GLADE catalog with a weight based on the three-dimensional GW localization map provided by LVC. We conducted galaxy-targeted and wide-field blind surveys, real-time data analysis, and visual inspection of observed galaxies. We performed galaxy-targeted follow-ups to 23 GW events during O3, and the maximum probability covered by our observations reached to 9.8\%. Among them, we successfully started observations for 10 GW events within 0.5 days after the detection. This result demonstrates that our follow-up observation has a potential to constrain EM radiation models for a merger of binary neutron stars at a distance of up to sim 100 sim Mpc with a probability area of \leq 500 sim deg2.

authors: Lorenzo Zaninetti
topic: Two new equations of motion for a supernova remnant (SNR) are derived in the framework of energy conservation for the thin-layer approximation. The first one is based on an inverse square law for the surrounding density and the second one on a non-cubic dependence of the swept mass. Under the assumption that the observed radio-flux scales as the flux of kinetic energy, two scaling laws are derived for the temporal evolution of the surface brightness of SNRs. The astrophysical applications cover two galactic samples of surface brightness and an extragalactic one.

title: GRB 170817A Afterglow from a Relativistic Electron-Positron Pair Wind Observed Off-axis
authors: Long Li, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: A relativistic electron-positron (e+e-) pair wind from a rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron star (NS) would interact with a gamma-ray burst (GRB) external shock and reshapes afterglow emission signatures. Assuming that the merger remnant of GW170817 is a long-lived NS, we show that a relativistic e+e- pair wind model with a simple top-hat jet viewed off-axis can reproduce multi-wavelength afterglow lightcurves and superluminal motion of GRB 170817A. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is adopted to obtain the best-fitting parameters, which give the jet half-opening angle Thetaj=0.11 rad, and the viewing angle Thetav=0.23 rad. The best-fitting value of θv is close to the lower limit of the prior which is chosen based on the gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations. In addition, we also derive the initial Lorentz factor Gamma0=47 and the isotropic kinetic energy EK,iso=2x1052 erg. A consistence between the corrected on-axis values for GRB 170817A and typical values observed for short GRBs indicates that our model can also reproduce the prompt emission of GRB 170817A. An NS with a magnetic field strength Bp=1.6x1013 G is obtained in our fitting, indicating that a relatively low thermalization efficiency \eta\leq 10-3 is needed to satisfy observational constraints on the kilonova. Furthermore, our model is able to reproduce a late-time shallow decay in the X-ray lightcurve and predicts that the X-ray and radio flux will continue to decline in the coming years.

authors: Shao-Peng Tang, Jin-Liang Jiang, Ming-Zhe Han, Yi-Zhong Fan, Da-Ming Wei
topic: Recently, the radius of neutron star (NS) PSR J0740+6620 was measured by NICER and an updated measurement of neutron skin thickness of 208Pb (R208skin) was reported by the PREX-II experiment. These new measurements can help us better understand the unknown equation of state (EoS) of dense matter. In this work, we adopt a hybrid parameterization method, which incorporates the nuclear empirical parameterization and some widely used phenomenological parameterizations, to analyze the results of nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations. With the joint Bayesian analysis of GW170817, PSR J0030+0451, and PSR J0740+6620, the parameters that characterize the ultra dense matter EoS are constrained. We find that the slope parameter L is approximately constrained to 70+21-18 MeV, which predicts R208skin=0.204+0.030-0.026fm by using the universal relation between R208skin and L. And the bulk properties of canonical 1.4Msun NS (e.g., R1.4 and Lambda1.4) as well as the pressure (P2ρsat) at two times the nuclear saturation density are well constrained by the data, i.e., R1.4, Lambda1.4, and P2ρsat are approximately constrained to 12.3\pm 0.7 km, 330+140−100, and 4.1+1.5−1.2x1034dyncm-2, respectively. Besides, we find that the Bayes evidences of the hybrid star and normal NS assumptions are comparable, which indicates that current observation data are compatible with quarkyonic matter existing in the core of massive star. Finally, in the case of normal NS assumption, we obtain a constraint for the maximum mass of nonrotating NS MTOV=2.30+0.30−0.18 Ms. All of the uncertainties reported above are for 68.3% credible levels.

title: Gamma-Ray Flashes from Dark Photons in Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Melissa D. Diamond, Gustavo Marques-Tavares
topic: In this letter we begin the study of visible dark sector signals coming from binary neutron star mergers. We focus on dark photons emitted in the 10 ms - 1 s after the merger, and show how they can lead to bright transient gamma-ray signals. The signal will be approximately isotropic, and for much of the interesting parameter space will be close to thermal, with an apparent temperature of about 100 keV. These features can be used to distinguish the dark photon signal from the expected short gamma-ray bursts produced in neutron star mergers, which are beamed in a small angle and non-thermal. We calculate the expected signal strength and show that for dark photon masses in the 1−100 MeV range it can easily lead to total luminosities larger than 1046 ergs for much of the unconstrained parameter space. This signal can be used to probe a large fraction of the unconstrained parameter space motivated by freeze-in dark matter scenarios with interactions mediated by a dark photon in that mass range. We also comment on future improvements when proposed telescopes and mid-band gravitational detectors become operational.

title: A Simulation Study of Ultra-Relativistic Jets -- I. A New Code for Relativistic Hydrodynamics
authors: Jeongbhin Seo (1), Hyesung Kang (1), Dongsu Ryu (2), Seungwoo Ha (2), Indranil Chattopadhyay 
topic: In an attempt to investigate the structures of ultra-relativistic jets injected into the intracluster medium (ICM) and the associated flow dynamics, such as shocks, velocity shear, and turbulence, we have developed a new special relativistic hydrodynamic (RHD) code in the Cartesian coordinates, based on the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme. It is a finite difference scheme of high spatial accuracy, which has been widely employed for solving hyperbolic systems of conservation equations. The code is equipped with different WENO versions, such as the 5th-order accurate WENO-JS (Jiang & Shu 1996), WENO-Z, and WENO-ZA, and different time integration methods, such as the 4th-order accurate Runge-Kutta (RK4) and strong stability preserving RK (SSPRK), as well as the implementation of the equations of state (EOSs) that closely approximate the EOS of the single-component perfect gas in relativistic regime. In addition, it incorporates a high-order accurate averaging of fluxes along the transverse directions to enhance the accuracy of multi-dimensional problems, and a modification of eigenvalues for the acoustic modes to effectively control the carbuncle instability. Through extensive numerical tests, we assess the accuracy and robustness of the code, and choose WENO-Z, SSPRK, and the EOS suggested in Ryu et al. (2006) as the fiducial setup for simulations of ultra-relativistic jets. The results of our study of ultra-relativistic jets using the code is reported in an accompanying paper (Seo et al. 2021, Paper II).

title: Can we measure the collapse time of a post-merger remnant for a future GW170817-like event?
authors: Paul J. Easter, Paul D. Lasky, Andrew R. Casey
topic: Measuring the collapse time of a binary neutron star merger remnant can inform the physics of extreme matter and improve modelling of short gamma-ray bursts and associated kilonova. The lifetime of the post-merger remnant directly impacts the mechanisms available for the jet launch of short gamma-ray bursts. We develop and test a method to measure the collapse time of post-merger remnants. We show that for a GW170817-like event at 40Mpc, a network of Einstein Telescope with Cosmic Explorer is required to detect collapse times of 10ms. For a two-detector network at A+ design sensitivity, post-merger remnants with collapse times of ∼10ms must be ≲10Mpc to be measureable. This increases to 18−26Mpc if we include the proposed Neutron star Extreme Matter Observatory (NEMO), increasing the effective volume by a factor of 30.

title: Axisymmetric magneto-plastic evolution of neutron-star crusts
authors: Konstantinos N. Gourgouliatos, Samuel K. Lander
topic: Magnetic field evolution in neutron-star crusts is driven by the Hall effect and Ohmic dissipation, for as long as the crust is sufficiently strong to absorb Maxwell stresses exerted by the field and thus make the momentum equation redundant. For the strongest neutron-star fields, however, stresses build to the point of crustal failure, at which point the standard evolution equations are no longer valid. Here, we study the evolution of the magnetic field of the crust up to and beyond crustal failure, whence the crust begins to flow plastically. We perform global axisymmetric evolutions, exploring different types of failure affecting a limited region of the crust. We find that a plastic flow does not simply suppress the Hall effect even in the regime of a low plastic viscosity, but it rather leads to non-trivial evolution -- in some cases even overreacting and enhancing the impact of the Hall effect. Its impact is more pronouced in the toroidal field, with the differences on the poloidal field being less substantial. We argue that both the nature of magnetar bursts and their spindown evolution will be affected by plastic flow, so that observations of these phenomena may help to constrain the way the crust fails.

In a small fraction of long GRBs this power law splits into two components such that the spectrum presents, in addition to the typical MeV nuFnu peak, a break at the order of a few keV or hundreds keV. The typical power law slopes below and above the break are -0.6 and -1.5 respectively. If the break is a common feature, the value of alphaB could be an ''average'' of the spectral slopes below and above the break in GRBs fitted with Band function. We analyze the spectra of 27 (9) bright long (short) GRBs detected by the Fermi satellite finding a low energy break between 80 keV and 280 keV in 12 long GRBs, but in none of the short events. Through spectral simulations we show that if the break is moved closer (farther) to the peak energy a relatively harder (softer) αB is found by fitting the simulated spectra with the Band function. The hard average slope alphaB=-0.38 found in short GRBs suggests that the break is close to the peak energy. We show that for 15 long GRBs best fitted by the Band function only, the break could be present, but it is not identifiable in the Fermi/GBM spectrum, because either at low energies, close to the detector limit for relatively soft alphaB=−1, or in the proximity of the energy peak for relatively hard alphaB=−1. A spectrum with two breaks could be typical of GRB prompt emission, though hard to identify with current detectors. Instrumental design such that conceived for the THESEUS space mission, extending from 0.3 keV to several MeV and featuring a larger effective area with respect to Fermi/GBM, can reveal a larger fraction of GRBs with a spectral energy break.

title: Jet propagation in expanding media
authors: Ore Gottlieb, Ehud Nakar
topic: We present a comprehensive analytic model of a relativistic jet propagation in expanding media. This model is the first to cover the entire jet evolution from early to late times, as well as a range of configurations that are relevant to binary neutron star mergers. These include low and high luminosity jets, unmagnetized and mildly magnetized jets, time-dependent luminosity jets, and Newtonian and relativistic head velocities. We also extend the existing solution of jets in a static medium to power-law density media with index alpha<5. Our model, which is tested and calibrated by a suite of 3D RMHD simulations, provides simple analytic formulae for the jet head propagation and breakout times, as well as a simple breakout criterion which depends only on the jet to ejecta energy ratio and jet opening angle. Assuming a delay time td between the onset of a homologous ejecta expansion and jet launching, the system evolution has two main regimes: strong and weak jets. The regime depends on the ratio between the jet head velocity in the ejecta frame and the local ejecta velocity, denoted as eta. Strong jets start their propagation in the ejecta on a timescale shorter than td with eta \ll 1, and within several ejecta dynamical times eta drops below unity. Weak jets are unable to penetrate the ejecta at first (start with η\ll 1), and breach the ejecta only after the ejecta expands over a timescale longer than td, thus their evolution is independent of td. After enough time, both strong and weak jets approach an asymptotic phase where η is constant. Applying our model to short GRBs, we find that there is most likely a large diversity of ejecta mass, where mass \leq 10−3 Msun (at least along the poles) is common.

title: Crust-core transition of a neutron star: effect of the temperature under strong magnetic fields
authors: Márcio Ferreira, Aziz Rabhi, Constança Providência
topic: The effect of temperature on the crust-core transition of a magnetar is studied. The thermodynamical spinodals are used to calculate the transition region within a relativistic mean-field approach for the equation of state. Magnetic fields with intensities 5x1016 G and 5x1017 G are considered. It is shown that the effect on the extension of the crust-core transition is washed away for temperatures above 109 K for magnetic field intensities \leq 5x1016 G but may still persist if a magnetic field as high as 5x1017G is considered. For temperatures below that value, the effect of the magnetic field on crust-core transition is noticeable and grows as the temperature decreases and, in particular, it is interesting to identify the existence of disconnected non-homogeneous matter above the B=0 crust core transition density. Models with different symmetry energy slopes at saturation show quite different behaviors. In particular, a model with a large slope, as suggested by the recent results of PREX-2, predicts the existence of up to four disconnected regions of non-homogeneous matter above the zero magnetic field crust-core transition density.

title: Neutron star mergers as the astrophysical site of the r-process in the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies
authors: Shinya Wanajo, Yutaka Hirai, Nikos Prantzos
topic: Recent progress of nucleosynthesis work as well as the discovery of a kilonova associated with the gravitational-wave source GW170817 indicates that neutron star mergers (NSM) can be a site of the r-process. Several studies of galactic chemical evolution, however, have pointed out inconsistencies between this idea and the observed stellar abundance signatures in the Milky Way: (a) the presence of Eu at low (halo) metallicity and (b) the descending trend of Eu/Fe at high (disc) metallicity. In this study, we explore the galactic chemical evolution of the Milky Way's halo, disc and satellite dwarf galaxies. Particular attention is payed to the forms of delay-time distributions for both type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) and NSMs. The Galactic halo is modeled as an ensemble of independently evolving building-block galaxies with different masses. The single building blocks as well as the disc and satellite dwarfs are treated as well-mixed one-zone systems. Our results indicate that the aforementioned inconsistencies can be resolved and thus NSMs can be the unique r-process site in the Milky Way, provided that the delay-time distributions satisfy the following conditions: (i) a long delay (approx 1 Gyr) for the appearance of the first SN Ia (or a slow early increase of its number) and (ii) an additional early component providing greater 50\% of all NSMs with a delay of sim 0.1 Gyr. In our model, r-process-enhanced and r-process-deficient stars in the halo appear to have originated from ultra-faint dwarf-sized and massive building blocks, respectively. Our results also imply that the natal kicks of binary neutron stars have a little impact on the evolution of Eu in the disc.

title: On the Polarized Absorption Lines in Gamma-ray Burst Optical Afterglows
authors: J. Mao, R. J. Britto, D. A. H. Buckley, S. Covino, P. D'Avanzo, N. P. M. Kuin
topic: Spectropolarimetric measurements of gamma-ray burst (GRB) optical afterglows contain polarization information for both continuum and absorption lines. Based on the Zeeman effect, an absorption line in a strong magnetic field is polarized and split into a triplet. In this paper, we solve the polarization radiative transfer equations of the absorption lines, and obtain the degree of linear polarization of the absorption lines as a function of the optical depth. In order to effectively measure the degree of linear polarization for the absorption lines, a magnetic field strength of at least 103 G is required. The metal elements that produce the polarized absorption lines should be sufficiently abundant and have large oscillation strengths or Einstein absorption coefficients. We encourage both polarization measurements and high-dispersion observations of the absorption lines in order to detect the triplet structure in early GRB optical afterglows.

title: Radio afterglow of magnetars' giant flares
authors: Riddhi Mehta, Maxim Barkov, Maxim Lyutikov
topic: We develop a model for the radio afterglow of the giant flare of SGR 1806-20 arising due to the interaction of magnetically-dominated cloud, an analogue of Solar Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), with the interstellar medium (ISM). The CME is modeled as a spheromak-like configuration. The CME is first advected with the magnetar's wind and later interacts with the ISM, creating a strong forward shock and complicated backwards exhaust flow. Using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we study various relative configurations of the magnetic field of the CME with respect to the ISM's magnetic field. We show that the dynamics of the forward shock mostly follows the Sedov-Taylor blastwave, while the internal structure of the shocked medium is considerably modified by the back flow, creating a multiple shock configuration. We calculate synthetic synchrotron emissivity maps and light curves using two assumptions: (i) magnetic field compression; (ii) amplification of the magnetic field at the shock.We find that models with magnetic field amplification account better for the observed radio emission.

title: A new method for detecting fast neutrino flavor conversions in core-collapse supernova models with two-moment neutrino transport
authors: Hiroki Nagakura, Lucas Johns
topic: Fast-pairwise neutrino oscillations potentially affect many aspects of core-collapse supernova (CCSN): the explosion mechanism, neutrino signals, and nucleosynthesis in the ejecta. This particular mode of collective neutrino oscillations has a deep connection to the angular structure of neutrinos in momentum space; for instance, the appearance of electron neutrinos lepton number (ELN) angular crossings in momentum space is a good indicator of occurrences of the flavor conversions. However, many multi-dimensional (multi-D) CCSN simulations are carried out with approximate neutrino transport (such as two-moment methods), which limits the access to the angular distributions of neutrinos, i.e., inhibits ELN-crossing searches. In this paper, we develop a new method of ELN-crossing search in these CCSN simulations. The required data is the zero-th and first angular moments of neutrinos and matter profile, all of which are available in CCSN models with two-moment method. One of the novelties of our new method is to use a ray-tracing neutrino transport to determine ELNs in the direction of the stellar center. It is designed to compensate for shortcomings of the crossing searches only with the two angular moments. We assess the capability of the method by carrying out a detailed comparison to results of full Boltzmann neutrino transport in 1D and 2D CCSN models. We find that the ray-tracing neutrino transport improves the accuracy of crossing searches; indeed, the appearance/disappearance of the crossings is accurately detected even in the region of forward-peaked angular distributions. The new method is computationally cheap and has a benefit of efficient parallelization; hence, it will be useful for ELN-crossing searches in any CCSN models employed two-moment neutrino transport.

title: Bayesian model-selection of neutron star equation of state using multi-messenger observations
authors: Bhaskar Biswas
topic: Measurement of macroscopic properties of neutron stars, whether in binary or in an isolated system, provides us a key opportunity to place a stringent constraint on its equation of state. In this {\em letter}, we perform Bayesian model-selection on a wide variety of neutron star equation of state using multi-messenger observations. In particular, (i) we use the mass and tidal deformability measurement from two binary neutron star merger event, GW170817 and GW190425; (ii) simultaneous mass-radius measurement of PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 by NICER collaboration, while the latter has been analyzed by joint NICER/radio/XMM-Newton collaboration. Among the 31 equations of state considered in this analysis, we are able to rule out 7 of them decisively, which are either extremely stiff or soft equations of state. The most preferred equation of state model turns out to be AP3, which predicts the radius and tidal deformability of a 1.4Msun neutron star to be 12.10 km and 393 respectively.

title: From Neutrino- to Photon-Cooled in Three Years: Can Fallback Accretion Explain the X-ray Excess in GW170817?
authors: Brian D. Metzger, Rodrigo Fernandez
topic: An excess in the X-ray emission from the neutron star merger GW170817 above the predicted afterglow was recently detected t3.4 years post-merger. One possible origin for the excess is accretion onto the newly unshrouded black hole (BH) remnant (Hajela et al. 2021, Ishizaki et al. 2021). While fall-back of the bound dynamical ejecta is insufficient to generate the excess luminosity, L_X ~ 5e38 erg/s, fall-back from the disk wind ejecta-due to their larger mass and lower velocity-remains a viable possibility. We present hydrodynamic alpha-viscosity simulations of the post-merger disk evolution which extend to an unprecedently long timescale t 35 s post-merger, as necessary to capture the end of photodissociation and the asymptotic evolution into the radiatively inefficient regime. Due to inefficient neutrino cooling, the BH accretion rate decays rapidly at late times (MdotBH sim t(-\betaBH), where \betaBH sim 2.4-2.8), seemingly incompatible with generating the late-time excess. However, the rate at which matter falls back to the inner disk from the equatorial regions (as inferred by the rate matter is unbound in outflows by viscous heating at higher latitudes) decays more gradually, Mdotfb sim t^-\betafb) with \beta_fb sim 1.43 in our alpha sim 0.03 simulations. By the present epoch, the fall-back rate has become sub-Eddington and the disk can again accrete efficiently, i.e. MdotBH ~ Mdotfb, this time as a result of photon cooling instead of neutrino cooling. The predicted X-ray accretion luminosity at the present epoch is L_X 0.1 Mdot_BH c^2 (2-70)e38 erg/s for betaFB sim 1.43-1.66, thus supporting (with caveats) an accretion-powered origin for the X-ray excess in GW170817. The suppressed BH accretion rate prior to the radiatively efficient (sub-Eddington) transition, weeks to months after the merger, is key to avoid overproducing the kilonova luminosity via reprocessing.

title: Neutron stars in f(𝚁,𝙻𝚖) gravity with realistic equations of state: joint-constrains with GW170817, massive pulsars, and the PSR J0030+0451 mass-radius from NICER data
authors: R. V. Lobato, G. A. Carvalho, C. A. Bertulani
topic: In this work we investigate neutron stars (NS) in f(𝚁,𝙻𝚖) theory of gravity for the case f(𝚁,𝙻𝚖)=𝚁+𝙻𝚖+sigma𝚁𝙻𝚖, where 𝚁 is the Ricci scalar and 𝙻𝚖 the Lagrangian matter density. In the term sigma𝚁𝙻𝚖, sigma represents the coupling between the gravitational and particles fields. For the first time the hydrostatic equilibrium equations in the theory are solved considering realistic equations of state and NS masses and radii obtained are subject to joint constrains from massive pulsars, the gravitational wave event GW170817 and from the PSR J0030+0451 mass-radius from NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data. We show that in this theory of gravity, the mass-radius results can accommodate massive pulsars, while the general theory of relativity can hardly do it. The theory also can explain the observed NS within the radius region constrained by the GW170817 and PSR J0030+0451 observations for masses around 1.4 Msun.

authors: Hirokazu Sasaki, Yuta Yamazaki, Toshitaka Kajino, Motohiko Kusakabe, Takehito Hayakawa, Myung-Ki Cheoun, Heamin Ko, Grant J. Mathews
topic: We calculate Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) of Mo and Ru by taking into account the contribution from nu-p-process nucleosynthesis. We estimate yields of p-nuclei such as 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru through the nu-p-process in various supernova (SN) progenitors based upon recent models. In particular, the nu-p-process in energetic hypernovae produces a large amount of p-nuclei compared to the yield in ordinary core-collapse SNe. Because of this the abundances of 92,94Mo and 96,98Ru in the Galaxy are significantly enhanced at [Fe/H]=0 by the nu-p-process. We find that the nu-p-process in hypernovae is the main contributor to the elemental abundance of 92Mo at low metallicity [Fe/H] less 2. Our theoretical prediction of the elemental abundances in metal-poor stars becomes more consistent with observational data when the nu-p-process in hypernovae is taken into account.

title: Energy injection driven by precessing jets in gamma-ray burst afterglows
authors: Bao-Quan Huang, Tong Liu
topic: Jet precession is considered to universally exist in different-scale astronomical phenomena, including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For the long-lived GRB central engine, the relativistical precessing jets will periodically inject kinetic energy into the external shocks, then significantly modulate the shapes of the light curves (LCs) in GRB afterglows. In this paper, we adopt the standard external shock model to investigate the effects of jet precession on GRB X-ray afterglows in cases with different parameters, i.e., the steady or time-dependent jet powers, precession periods, precession angles, and viewing angles. In the case where the jet powers are in steady or slow decay and the jet can sweep across the line of sight, shallow decay (or plateau) segments should appear; otherwise, a giant bump will emerge in the GRB afterglow LCs. We show that jet precession is a new plausible mechanism of the energy injection in GRBs. Moreover, some observed X-ray transients without GRB associations might be powered by the precessing jets.

title: Strong magnetic fields: neutron stars with an extended inner crust
authors: Helena Pais, Bruno Bertolino, Jianjun Fang, Xiaopeng Wang, Constança Providência
topic: Using relativistic mean-field models, the formation of clusterized matter, as the one expected to exist in the inner crust of neutron stars, is determined under the effect of strong magnetic fields. As already predicted from a calculation of the unstable modes resulting from density fluctuations at subsaturation densities, we confirm in the present work that for magnetic field intensities of the order of =5x1016 G to 5x1017 G, pasta phases may occur for densities well above the zero-field crust-core transition density. This confirms that the extension of the crust may be larger than expected. It is also verified that the equilibrium structure of the clusterized matter is very sensitive to the intensity of the magnetic fields. As a result, the decay of the magnetic field may give rise to internal stresses which may result on the yield and fracture of the inner crust lattice.

title: Quasi-universality of the magnetic deformation of neutron stars in general relativity and beyond
authors: J. Soldateschi, N. Bucciantini, L. Del Zanna
topic: Neutron stars are known to host extremely powerful magnetic fields. Among other effects, one of the consequences of harbouring such fields is the deformation of the neutron star structure, leading, together with rotation, to the emission of continuous gravitational waves. On the one hand, the details of their internal magnetic fields are mostly unknown. Likewise, their internal structure, encoded by the equation of state, is highly uncertain. Here we present a study of axisymmetric models of isolated magnetised neutron stars, for various realistic equations of state considered viable by observations and nuclear physics constraints. We show that it is possible to find simple relations between the magnetic deformation of a neutron star, its Komar mass and its circumferential radius. Such relations are quasi-universal, meaning that they are mostly independent on the equation of state of the neutron star and only slightly dependent on the magnetic field configuration. Being formulated in terms of potentially observable quantities, as we discuss, our results could help to constrain the magnetic properties of the neutron star interior and to better assess the detectability of continuous gravitational waves by isolated neutron stars, without knowing their equation of state. Our results are derived both in general relativity and in scalar-tensor theories - one of the most promising extensions of general relativity - in this case by considering also the scalar charge. We show that even in this case general relations hold that account for deviations from general relativity, that could potentially be used to set constraints on the gravitational theory.

The main emphasis is on the hyperonization of the dense matter, and the role played by the Delta-resonances. The implications of hyperonization for the astrophysics of compact stars, including the equation of state, composition, and stellar parameters are examined. The mass-radius relation and tidal deformabilities of static and rapidly rotating (Keplerian) configurations are discussed in some detail. We briefly touch upon some other recent developments involving hyperonization in hot hypernuclear matter at high- and low-densities.

topic: We present optical follow-up observation results of three binary black hole merger (BBH) events, GW190408 181802, GW190412, and GW190503 185404, which were detected by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave (GW) detectors. Electromagnetic (EM) counterparts are generally not expected for BBH merger events. However, some theoretical models suggest that EM counterparts of BBH can possibly arise in special environments, prompting motivation to search for EM counterparts for such events. We observed high-credibility regions of the sky for the three BBH merger events with telescopes of the Gravitational-wave EM Counterpart Korean Observatory (GECKO), including the KMTNet. Our observation started as soon as 100 minutes after the GW event alerts and covered 29 - 63 deg2 for each event with a depth of  22.5 mag in R-band within hours of observation. No plausible EM counterparts were found for these events, but from no detection in the GW190503 185404 event, for which we covered 69\% credibility region, we place the BBH merger EM counterpart signal to be Mg \g -18.0 AB mag within about 1 day of the GW event. The comparison of our detection limits with light curves of several kilonova models suggests that a kilonova event could have been identified within hours from GW alert with GECKO observations if the compact merger happened at < 400 Mpc and the localization accuracy was of order of 50 deg2. Our result gives a great promise for the GECKO facilities to find EM counterparts within a few hours from GW detection in future GW observation runs.

title: On the Binary-Neutron-Star Post-Merger Magnetar Origin of XRT 210423
authors: Shunke Ai, Bing Zhang
topic: XRT 201423 is an X-ray transient with a nearly flat plateau lasting 4.1 ks followed by a steep decay. This feature indicates that it might come from a magnetar formed through a binary neutron star merger, similar to CDF-X2 and as predicted. We test the compliance of the data with this model and use the observed duration and flux of the X-ray signal as well as upper limits of optical emission to pose constraints on the parameters of the underlying putative magnetar. Both the free-zone and trapped-zone geometric configurations are considered. We find that the data are generally consistent with such a model. The surface dipolar magnetic field and the ellipticity of the magnetar should satisfy Bp less 7x1014G (Bp less 4.9x1014G) and eps less 1.5x10−3 (eps less 1.1x10−3) under free zone (trapped zone) configurations, respectively. An upper limit on the distance (e.g. z less 0.55 with eta x=10−4) can be derived from the X-ray data which depends on the X-ray dissipation efficiency eta x of the spin-down luminosity. The non-detection of optical counterpart places a conservative lower limit on the distance of the source, i.e. z \g 0.03 regardless of the geometric configuration.

topic: Light axion fields, if they exist, can be sourced by neutron stars due to their coupling to nuclear matter, and play a role in binary neutron star mergers. We report on a search for such axions by analysing the gravitational waves from the binary neutron star inspiral GW170817. We find no evidence of axions in the sampled parameter space. The null result allows us to impose constraints on axions with masses below 10-11eV by excluding the ones with decay constants ranging from 1.6x1016GeV to 1018GeV at 3sigma confidence level. Our analysis provides the first constraints on axions from neutron star inspirals, and rules out a large region in parameter space that has not been probed by the existing experiments.

title: Neutrino propagation in winds around the central engine of sGRB
authors: G. Morales, N. Fraija
topic: Since neutrinos can escape from dense regions without being deflected, they are promising candidates to study the new physics at the sources that produce them. With the increasing development of more sensitive detectors in the coming years, we will infer several intrinsic properties from incident neutrinos. In particular, we centralise our study in those produced by thermal processes in short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) and their interactions within the central engine's anisotropic medium. On the one hand, we consider baryonic winds produced with a strong magnetic contribution, and on the other hand, we treat only neutrino-driven winds. First, we obtain the effective neutrino potential considering both baryonic density profiles around the central engine. Then, we get the three-flavour oscillation probabilities in this medium to finally calculate the expected neutrino ratios. We find a stronger angular dependence on the expected neutrino ratios, which, incidentally, contrast from the expected theoretical ratios without considering the winds' additional contribution. The joint analysis of this observable, together with the sGRB ejected jet angle, might lead to an effective mechanism to discriminate between the involved merger progenitors (black hole-neutron star or neutron star-neutron star), acting as an additional detection channel to gravitational waves.

title: Deep searches for X-ray pulsations from Scorpius X-1 and Cygnus X-2 in support of continuous gravitational wave searches
authors: Shanika Galaudage, Karl Wette, Duncan K. Galloway, Chris Messenger
topic: Neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries are hypothesised to emit continuous gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based observatories. The torque balance model predicts that a higher accretion rate produces larger-amplitude gravitational waves, hence low mass X-ray binaries with high X-ray flux are promising targets for gravitational wave searches. The detection of X-ray pulsations would identify the spin frequency of these neutron stars, and thereby improve the sensitivity of continuous gravitational-wave searches by reducing the volume of the search parameter space. We perform a semi-coherent search for pulsations in the two low mass X-ray binaries Scorpius X-1 and Cygnus X-2 using X-ray data from the \textit{ Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer} Proportional Counter Array. We find no clear evidence for pulsations, and obtain upper limits (at 90% confidence) on the fractional pulse amplitude, with the most stringent being 0.034\% for Scorpius X-1 and 0.23\% for Cygnus X-2. These upper limits improve upon those of Vaughan et al. (1994) by factors of 8.2 and 1.6 respectively.

title: Variability of magnetically-dominated jets from accreting black holes
authors: Agnieszka Janiuk, Bestin James, Ishika Palit
topic: Structured jets are recently invoked to explain the complex emission of gamma ray bursts, such as GW 170817. Based on the accretion simulations, the jets are expected to have a structure that is more complex than a simple top-hat. Also, the structure of launching regions of blazar jets should influence their large scale evolution. This is recently revealed by the interactions of jet components in TXS 0506+056, where the jet is observed at a viewing angle close to zero. Observational studies have also shown an anti-correlation between the jet variability, measured e.g. by its minimum variability time scale, and the Lorentz factor, that spans several orders of magnitude and covers both blazars and GRBs samples. Motivated by those observational properties of black hole sources, we investigate the accretion inflow and outflow properties, by means of numerical GR MHD simulations. We perform axisymmetric calculations of the structure and evolution of central engine, composed of magnetized torus around Kerr black hole that is launching a non-uniform jet. We probe the jet energetics at different points along the line of sight, and we measure the jet time variability as localized in these specific regions. We quantify our results by computing the minimum variability timescales and power density spectra. We reproduce the MTS-Γ correlation and we attribute it to the black hole spin as the main driving parameter of the engine. We also find that the PDS slope is not strongly affected by the black hole spin, while it differs for various viewing angles.

title: Neutron star asteroseismology and nuclear saturation parameter
authors: Hajime Sotani
topic: Adopting various unified equations of state (EOSs), we examine the quasinormal modes of gravitational waves from cold neutron stars. We focus on the fundamental (f-), 1st pressure (p1-), and 1st spacetime (w1-) modes, and derive the empirical formulae for the frequencies and damping rate of those modes. With the resultant empirical formulae, we find that the value of eta, which is a specific combination of the nuclear saturation parameters, can be estimated within 30\% accuracy, if the f-mode frequency from the neutron star whose mass is known would be observed or if the f- and p1-mode frequencies would be simultaneously observed, even though this estimation is applicable only for the low-mass neutron stars. Additionally, we find that the mass and radius of canonical neutron stars can be estimated within a few percent accuracy via the simultaneous observations of the f- and w1-mode frequencies. We also find that, if the f-, p1-, and w1-mode frequencies would be simultaneously observed, the mass of canonical neutron stars can be estimated within 2\% accuracy, while the radius can be estimated within 1\% for the neutron star with M\geq 1.6Msun or within 0.6\% for the neutron star with M\geq1.4Msun constructed with the EOS constrained via the GW170817 event. Furthermore, we find the strong correlation between the maximum f-mode frequency and the neutron star radius with the maximum mass, between the minimum w1-mode frequency and the maximum mass, and between the minimum damping rate of the w1-mode and the stellar compactness for the neutron star with the maximum mass.

title: Neutron Stars Mass-Radius relationship and Electromagnetic follow-up of Kilonovae
authors: D. Barba-González, M. Ángeles Pérez-García
topic: When two Neutron Stars collide a multi-band electromagnetic emission, known as Kilonova (KN), follows being powered by the radioactive decay of ejecta products. In this contribution we discuss how the equation of state of dense matter, impacts the mass and velocity in the KN ejecta and thus its light curve. Using this information encoded in the stellar mass-radius relationship, we ellaborate on how the future experimental observations in photon channels, in addition to complementary multimessenger probes, could provide a new and more detailed insight into the equation of state of nuclear matter.

authors: R. T. Wollaeger, C. L. Fryer, E. A. Chase, C. J. Fontes, M. Ristic, A. L. Hungerford, O. Korobkin, R. O'Shaughnessy, A. M. Herring
topic: Depending upon the properties of their compact remnants and the physics included in the models, simulations of neutron star mergers can produce a broad range of ejecta properties. The characteristics of this ejecta, in turn, define the kilonova emission. To explore the effect of ejecta properties, we present a grid of 2-component 2D axisymmetric kilonova simulations that vary mass, velocity, morphology, and composition. The masses and velocities of each component vary, respectively, from 0.001 to 0.1 Msun and 0.05 to 0.3c, covering much of the range of results from the neutron star merger literature. The set of 900 models is constrained to have a toroidal low electron fraction (Ye) ejecta with a robust r-process composition and either a spherical or lobed high-Ye ejecta with two possible compositions. We simulate these models with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SuperNu using a full suite of lanthanide and 4th row element opacities. We examine the trends of these models with parameter variation, show how it can be used with statistical tools, and compare the model light curves and spectra to those of AT2017gfo, the electromagnetic counterpart of GW170817.

title: Jets, disc-winds and oscillations in general relativistic, magnetically driven flows around black hole
authors: Indu K. Dihingia, Bhargav Vaidya, Christian Fendt
topic: Relativistic jets and disc-winds are typically observed in BH-XRBs and AGNs. However, many physical details of jet launching and the driving of disc winds from the underlying accretion disc are still not fully understood. In this study, we further investigate the role of the magnetic field strength and structure in launching jets and disc winds. In particular, we explore the connection between jet, wind, and the accretion disc around the central black hole. We perform axisymmetric GRMHD simulations of the accretion-ejection system using adaptive mesh refinement. Essentially, our simulations are initiated with a thin accretion disc in equilibrium. An extensive parametric study by choosing different combinations of magnetic field strength and initial magnetic field inclination is also performed. Our study finds relativistic jets driven by the Blandford \& Znajek (BZ) mechanism and the disc-wind driven by the Blandford \& Payne (BP) mechanism. We also find that plasmoids are formed due to the reconnection events, and these plasmoids advect with disc-winds. As a result, the tension force due to the poloidal magnetic field is enhanced in the inner part of the accretion disc, resulting in disc truncation and oscillation. These oscillations result in flaring activities in the jet mass flow rates. We find simulation runs with a lower value of the plasma-beta, and lower inclination angle parameters are more prone to the formation of plasmoids and subsequent inner disc oscillations. Our models provide a possible template to understand spectral state transition phenomena in BH-XRBs.

title: Impacts of NICER's Radius Measurement of PSR J0740+6620 on Nuclear Symmetry Energy at Suprasaturation Densities
authors: Nai-Bo Zhang, Bao-An Li
topic: By directly inverting several neutron star observables in the three-dimensional parameter space for the Equation of State of super-dense neutron-rich nuclear matter, we show that the lower radius limit R2.01 \geq 12.2 km at 68\% confidence level for PSR J0740+6620 of mass 2.08\pm0.07 Msun from Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER)'s very recent observation sets a much tighter lower boundary than previously known for nuclear symmetry energy in the density range of (1.0-3.0) times the saturation density ρ0 of nuclear matter. The super-soft symmetry energy leading to the formation of proton polarons in this density region of neutron stars is firmly ruled out by the first radius measurement for the most massive neutron star observed reliably so far.

title: Magneto-rotational instability in magnetically polarized discs
authors: Oscar M. Pimentel, P. Chris Fragile, F. D. Lora-Clavijo, Bridget Ierace, Deepika Bollimpalli 
topic: The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is the most likely mechanism for transportation of angular momentum and dissipation of energy within hot, ionized accretion discs. This instability is produced through the interactions of a differentially rotating plasma with an embedded magnetic field. Like all substances in nature, the plasma in an accretion disc has the potential to become magnetically polarized when it interacts with the magnetic field. In this paper, we study the effect of this magnetic susceptibility, parameterized by chim, on the MRI, specifically within the context of black hole accretion. We find from a linear analysis within the Newtonian limit that the minimum wavelength of the first unstable mode and the wavelength of the fastest growing mode are shorter in paramagnetic (\chim>0) than in diamagnetic (\chim<0) discs, all other parameters being equal. Furthermore, the magnetization parameter (ratio of gas to magnetic pressure) in the saturated state should be smaller when the magnetic susceptibility is positive than when it is negative. We confirm this latter prediction through a set of numerical simulations of magnetically polarized black hole accretion discs. We additionally find that the vertically integrated stress and mass accretion rate are somewhat larger when the disc is paramagnetic than when it is diamagnetic. If astrophysical discs are able to become magnetically polarized to any significant degree, then our results would be relevant to properly interpreting observations.

topic: We present the detection of a bright radio burst at radio frequencies between 2.2-2.3 GHz with the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) 70 m dish (DSS-63) in Madrid, Spain from FRB 20200120E. This repeating fast radio burst (FRB) was recently discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) instrument and reported to be associated with the M81 spiral galaxy at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. The high time resolution capabilities of the recording system used in this observation, together with the small amount of scattering and intrinsic brightness of the burst, allow us to explore the burst structure in unprecedented detail. We find that the burst has a duration of roughly 30 micro s and is comprised of several narrow components with typical separations of 2--3 micro s. The narrowest component has a width of \leq 100 nano s, which corresponds to a light travel time size as small as 30 m, the smallest associated with an FRB to date. The peak flux density of the narrowest burst component is 270 Jy. We estimate the total spectral luminosity of the narrowest component of the burst to be 4 x 1030 erg s-1 Hz-1, which is a factor of 500 above the luminosities of the so-called "nanoshots" associated with giant pulses from the Crab pulsar. This spectral luminosity is also higher than that of the radio bursts detected from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 during its outburst in April 2020, but it falls on the low-end of the currently measured luminosity distribution of extragalatic FRBs. These results provide further support for the presence of a continuum of FRB burst luminosities.

title: Closure relations during the plateau emission of Swift GRBs and the fundamental plane
authors: M. G. Dainotti, A. Ł. Lenart, N. Fraija, S. Nagataki, D. C. Warren, B. De Simone, G. Srinivasaragavan, A. Mata
topic: The Neil Gehrels Swift observatory observes Gamma-Ray bursts (GRBs) plateaus in X-rays. We test the reliability of the closure relations through the fireball model when dealing with the GRB plateau emission. We analyze 455 X-ray lightcurves (LCs) collected by \emph{Swift} from 2005 (January) until 2019 (August) for which the redshift is both known and unknown using the phenomenological Willingale 2007 model. Using these fits, we analyze the emission mechanisms and astrophysical environments of these GRBs through the closure relations within the time interval of the plateau emission. Finally, we test the 3D fundamental plane relation (Dainotti relation) which connects the prompt peak luminosity, the time at the end of the plateau (rest-frame), and the luminosity at that time, on the GRBs with redshift, concerning groups determined by the closure relations. This allows us to check if the intrinsic scatter \sigma_{int} of any of these groups is reduced compared to previous literature. The most fulfilled environments for the electron spectral distribution, p>2, are Wind Slow Cooling (SC) and ISM Slow Cooling for cases in which the parameter q, which indicates the flatness of the plateau emission and accounts for the energy injection, is =0 and =0.5, respectively, both in the cases with known and unknown redshifts. We also find that for the sGRBs All ISM Environments with q=0 have the smallest \sigma_{int}=0.04 \pm 0.15 in terms of the fundamental plane relation holding a probability of occurring by chance of p=0.005. We have shown that the majority of GRBs presenting the plateau emission fulfil the closure relations, including the energy injection, with a particular preference for the Wind SC environment. The subsample of GRBs that fulfil given relations can be used as possible standard candles and can suggest a way to reduce the intrinsic scatter of these studied relationships.

title: Chirp mass-distance distributions of the sources of gravitational waves
authors: Maciej Ossowski
topic: The detection of gravitational waves emitted by binary black holes raises questions regarding the origin of binaries. There are several models in the literature involving binary evolution in both the field and clusters. We compare the predictions of these models with observations and establish the reliability of this comparison. We use the likelihood calculation to compare the models in the space spanned by the observed chirp mass and the luminosity distance of the source. We rank the models by their ability to explain all current gravitational wave detections. It is shown that the most probable models correspond to binary evolution with low metallicity. Several variants of such evolution have similar likelihoods. The globular cluster model, considered here, is disfavoured. We present the usefulness of the method in distinguishing between models when new observations become available. We calculate the number of observations required to distinguish between each pair of models. We find that the number varies from ten to several thousand for some pairs of models, yet almost two-thirds of pairs are distinguishable with at most 100 observations.

authors: Xiao-Fei Jiang, Xin-Hui Wu, Peng-Wei Zhao
topic: The impact of nuclear mass uncertainties on the \emph{r}-process abundances has been systematically studied with the classical \emph{r}-process model by varying the mass of every individual nucleus in the range of 0.1 to 3.0 MeV based on six different mass models. A new quantitative relation between the uncertainties of \emph{r}-process abundances and those of the nuclear masses is extracted, i.e., a mass uncertainty of 0.5 MeV would lead to an abundance uncertainty of a factor around 2.5. It is found that this conclusion holds true for various mass models.

title: CDF-S XT1: The off-axis afterglow of a neutron star merger at z=2.23
authors: Nikhil Sarin, Gregory Ashton, Paul D. Lasky, Kendall Ackley, Yik-Lun Mong, Duncan K. Galloway
topic: CDF-S XT1 is a fast-rising non-thermal X-ray transient detected by \textit{Chandra} in the Deep-Field South Survey. Although various hypotheses have been suggested, the origin of this transient remains unclear. Here, we show that the observations of CDF-S XT1 are well explained as the X-ray afterglow produced by a relativistic structured jet viewed off-axis. We measure properties of the jet, showing that they are similar to those of GRB170817A, albeit at cosmological distances. We measure the observers viewing angle to be 10deg and the core of the ultra-relativistic jet to be 4.4deg, where the uncertainties are the 68% credible interval. The inferred properties and host galaxy combined with Hubble, radio, and optical non detections favour the hypothesis that CDF-S XT1 is the off-axis afterglow of a binary neutron star merger. We find that other previously suggested hypotheses are unable to explain all properties of CDF-S XT1. At a redshift of z=2.23, this is potentially the most distant observed neutron star merger to date and the first orphan afterglow of a short gamma-ray burst. We discuss the implications of a binary neutron star merger at such a high redshift for the star-formation rate in the early Universe, the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements, and the prospect of identifying other off-axis afterglows.

title: Global Simulations of Tidal Disruption Event Disk Formation via Stream Injection in GRRMHD
authors: Brandon Curd
topic: We use the general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics code KORAL to simulate the early stages of accretion disk formation resulting from the tidal disruption of a solar mass star around a super massive black hole (BH) of mass. We simulate the disruption of artificially more bound stars with orbital eccentricity e\leq0.99 (compared to the more realistic case of parabolic orbits with e=1) on close orbits with impact parameter beta\geq3. We use a novel method of injecting the tidal stream into the domain. For two simulations, we choose e=0.99 and inject mass at a rate that is similar to realistic TDEs. We find that the disk only becomes mildly circularized with eccentricity e\approx0.6 within the 3.5 days that we simulate. The rate of circularization is faster for pericenter radii that come closer to the BH. The emitted radiation is mildly super-Eddington with Lbol\approx-5LEdd and the photosphere is highly asymmetric with the photosphere being significantly closer to the inner accretion disk for viewing angles near pericenter. We find that soft X-ray radiation with Trad\approx3-5x105 K may be visible for chance viewing angles. Our simulations predict that TDEs should be radiatively inefficient with \ega\arppx0.009−0.014. These are the first simulations which simultaneously capture the stream, disk formation, and emitted radiation.

title: Tree-based solvers for adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH -- II: radiation transport module TreeRay
authors: Richard Wünsch, Stefanie Walch, František Dinnbier, Daniel Seifried, Sebastian Haid, Andre Klepitko, Anthony P. Whitworth, Jan Palouš
topic: The treatment of radiative transfer with multiple radiation sources is a critical challenge in simulations of star formation and the interstellar medium. In this paper we present the novel TreeRay method for solving general radiative transfer problems, based on reverse ray tracing combined with tree-based accelerated integration. We implement TreeRay in the adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH, as a module of the tree solver developed by Wünsch et al. However, the method itself is independent of the host code and can be implemented in any grid based or particle based hydrodynamics code. A key advantage of TreeRay is that its computational cost is independent of the number of sources, making it suitable for simulations with many point sources (e.g. massive star clusters) as well as simulations where diffuse emission is important. A very efficient communication and tree-walk strategy enables TreeRay to achieve almost ideal parallel scalings. TreeRay can easily be extended with sub-modules to treat radiative transfer at different wavelengths and to implement related physical processes. Here, we focus on ionising (EUV) radiation and use the On-the-Spot approximation to test the method and its parameters. The ability to set the tree solver time step independently enables the speedy calculation of radiative transfer in a multi-phase interstellar medium, where the hydrodynamic time step is typically limited by the sound speed of the hot gas produced in stellar wind bubbles or supernova remnants. We show that complicated simulations of star clusters with feedback from multiple massive stars become feasible with TreeRay.

topic: During a 2018 outburst, the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 was comprehensively monitored at multiple wavelengths as it underwent a hard to soft state transition. During this transition a rapid evolution in X-ray timing properties and a short-lived radio flare were observed, both of which were linked to the launching of bi-polar, long-lived relativistic ejecta. We provide detailed analysis of two Very Long Baseline Array observations, using both time binning and a new dynamic phase centre tracking technique to mitigate the effects of smearing when observing fast-moving ejecta at high angular resolution. We identify a second, earlier ejection, with a lower proper motion of 18.0 \pm 1.1 mas day−1. This new jet knot was ejected 4\mp 1 hours before the beginning of the rise of the radio flare, and 2\pm 1 hours before a switch from type-C to type-B X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). We show that this jet was ejected over a period of ∼6 hours and thus its ejection was contemporaneous with the QPO transition. Our new technique locates the original, faster ejection in an observation in which it was previously undetected. With this detection we revised the fits to the proper motions of the ejecta and calculated a jet inclination angle of (64 \pm 5)deg, and jet velocities of 0.97+0.03-0.09c for the fast-moving ejecta (Gamma greter 2.1) and (0.30 \pm 0.05)c for the newly-identified slow-moving ejection (Gamma =1.05 \pm 0.02). We show that the approaching slow-moving component is predominantly responsible for the radio flare, and is likely linked to the switch from type-C to type-B QPOs, while no definitive signature of ejection was identified for the fast-moving ejecta.

title: The large landscape of supernova, GRB and cocoon interactions
authors: Fabio De Colle, Pawan Kumar, Peter Hoeflich
topic: Long gamma ray bursts (LGRBs) are associated to the collapse of a massive star and the formation of a relativistic jet. As the jet propagates through the star, it forms an extended, hot cocoon. The dynamical evolution of the jet/cocoon system and its interaction with the environment has been studied extensively both analytically and numerically. On the other hand, the role played by the supernova (SN) explosion associated with LGRBs in determining the outcome of the system has been barely considered. In this paper, we discuss the large landscape of outcomes resulting from the interaction of the SN, jet and cocoon. We show that the outcome depends mainly on three timescales: the times for the cocoon and supernova shock wave to break through the surface of the progenitor star, and the time needed for the cocoon to engulf completely the progenitor star. The delay between the launch of the SN shock moving through the progenitor star and the jet can be related to these three timescales. Depending on the ordering of these time scales, the jet-cocoon might propagate inside the SN ejecta or the other way around, and the outcome for the properties of the explosion would be different. We discuss the imprint of the complex interaction between the jet-cocoon and the supernova shock on the emergent thermal and non-thermal radiation.

title: A global numerical model of the prompt emission in short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Hirotaka Ito (1,2), Oliver Just (3,1), Yuki Takei (4,5,1), Shigehiro Nagataki 
topic: We present the first global model of prompt emission from a short gamma-ray burst that consistently describes the evolution of the central black-hole (BH) torus system, the propagation of the jet through multi-component merger ejecta, the transition into free expansion, and the photospheric emission from the relativistic jet. To this end, we perform a special relativistic neutrino-hydrodynamics simulation of a viscous BH-torus system, which is formed about 500ms after the merger and is surrounded by dynamical ejecta as well as neutron star winds, along with a jet that is injected in the vicinity of the central BH. In a post-processing step, we compute the photospheric emission using a relativistic Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code. It is found that the wind from the torus leaves a strong imprint on the jet as well as on the emission causing narrow collimation and rapid time variability. The viewing angle dependence of the emission gives rise to correlations among the spectral peak energy, E_p, isotropic energy, E_iso, and peak luminosity, L_p, which may provide natural explanations for the Amati- and Yonetoku-relations. We also find that the degree of polarization is small for the emission from the jet core (<2\%), while it tends to increase with viewing angle outside of the core and can become as high as 10-40% for energies larger than the peak energy. Finally, the comparison of our model with GRB170817A strongly disfavors the photospheric emission scenario and therefore supports alternative scenarios, such as the cocoon shock breakout.

topic: We present the updated census and statistics of Lyman-alpha emitting long gamma-ray bursts host galaxies (LAE-LGRBs). We investigate the properties of a sub-sample of LAE-LGRBs and test the shell model commonly used to fit Lyman-alpha (Ly-alpha) emission line spectra. Among the LAE-LGRBs detected to date, we select a golden sample of four LAE-LGRBs allowing us to retrieve information on the host galaxy properties and of its interstellar medium gas. We fit their Ly-alpha spectra using the shell model, and constrain its parameters with the observed values. From the comparison of the statistics and properties of LAE-LGRBs to those of LAE samples in the literature, we find evidences of Ly-alpha suppression in dusty systems, and a fraction of LAE-LGRBs among the overall LGRB hosts lower than that found for Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) samples at similar redshift range. However, we find that LAE-LGRBs are representative of Lyα emission from the bulk of UV-selected galaxies at z - 2. We find that the golden sample of LAE-LGRBs are complex systems characterized by multiple emission blobs and by signs of possible galaxy interactions. The fitting procedure fails in recovering the HI column densities (NHI) measured from the afterglow spectra, and the other properties described by the shell-model parameters in the cases with very high NHI. The afterglows of most LGRBs and LAE-LGRBs show high NHI, implying that statistically the bulk of Ly-alpha photons expected to be produced by massive stars in the star-forming region hosting the GRB will be surrounded by such opaque lines of sight. We interpret our results in the context of more sophisticated models and of different dominant Lyα emitting regions. We also compare LAE-LGRBs to LAE Lyman continuum (LyC) leakers in the literature in terms of properties identified as possible indirect indicators of LyC leakage. [Abridged]

authors: Dougal Dobie, Tara Murphy, David L. Kaplan, Kenta Hotokezaka, Juan Pablo Bonilla Ataides, Elizabeth K. Mahony, Elaine M. Sadler
topic: The detection of gravitational waves from a neutron star merger, GW170817, marked the dawn of a new era in time-domain astronomy. Monitoring of the radio emission produced by the merger, including high-resolution radio imaging, enabled measurements of merger properties including the energetics and inclination angle. In this work we compare the capabilities of current and future gravitational wave facilities to the sensitivity of radio facilities to quantify the prospects for detecting the radio afterglows of gravitational wave events. We consider three observing strategies to identify future mergers -- widefield follow-up, targeting galaxies within the merger localisation and deep monitoring of known counterparts. We find that while planned radio facilities like the Square Kilometre Array will be capable of detecting mergers at gigaparsec distances, no facilities are sufficiently sensitive to detect mergers at the range of proposed third-generation gravitational wave detectors that would operate starting in the 2030s.

title: Moving-mesh radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of wind-reprocessed transients
authors: Diego Calderón, Ondřej Pejcha, Paul C. Duffell
topic: Motivated by recent theoretical work on tidal disruption events and other peculiar transients, we present moving-mesh radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of radiative luminosity emitted by a central source being reprocessed by a wind-like outflow. We couple the moving-mesh hydrodynamic code JET with our newly-developed radiation module based on mixed-frame grey flux-limited diffusion with implicit timestep update. This allows us to study the self-consistent multi-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic evolution over more than ten orders of magnitude in both space and time in a single run. We simulate an optically-thick spherical wind with constant or evolving mass-loss rate, which is irradiated by a central isotropic or angularly-dependent radiation source. Our spherically-symmetric simulations confirm previous analytic results by identifying different stages of radiation reprocessing: radiation trapped in the wind, diffusing out through the wind, and reaching constant maximum attenuation. We find that confining the central radiation source in a cone with moderate opening angles decreases significantly the early flux along sightlines oriented away from the direction of radiation injection but that the reprocessed radiation becomes isotropic roughly after one lateral diffusion time through the ejecta. We discuss further applications and guidelines for the use of our novel radiation-hydrodynamics tool in the context of transient modelling.

authors: Peter T. H. Pang, Ingo Tews, Michael W. Coughlin, Mattia Bulla, Chris Van Den Broeck, Tim Dietrich
topic: In the past few years, new observations of neutron stars and neutron-star mergers have provided a wealth of data that allow one to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter at densities above nuclear saturation density. However, most observations were based on neutron stars with masses of about 1.4 solar masses, probing densities up to ∼ 3-4 times the nuclear saturation density. Even higher densities are probed inside massive neutron stars such as PSR J0740+6620. Very recently, new radio observations provided an update to the mass estimate for PSR J0740+6620 and X-ray observations by the NICER and XMM telescopes constrained its radius. Based on these new measurements, we revisit our previous nuclear-physics multi-messenger astrophysics constraints and derive updated constraints on the equation of state describing the neutron-star interior. By combining astrophysical observations of two radio pulsars, two NICER measurements, the two gravitational-wave detections GW170817 and GW190425, detailed modeling of the kilonova AT2017gfo, as well as the gamma-ray burst GRB170817A, we are able to estimate the radius of a typical 1.4-solar mass neutron star to be 11.94+0.76−0.87km at 90\% confidence. Our analysis allows us to revisit the upper bound on the maximum mass of neutron stars and disfavours the presence of a strong first-order phase transition from nuclear matter to exotic forms of matter, such as quark matter, inside neutron stars.

authors: S. Blinnikov, D. Nadyozhin, N. Kramarev, A. Yudin
topic: This paper provides an overview of the current state of the stripping model for short gamma-ray bursts. After the historical joint detection of the gravitational wave event GW170817 and the accompanying gamma-ray burst GRB170817A, the relation between short gamma-ray bursts and neutron star mergers has been reliably confirmed. We show that many properties of GRB170817A, which turned out to be peculiar in comparison with other short gamma-ray bursts, are naturally explained in the context of the stripping model, specifically, the time (1.7 s) between the peak of the gravitational wave signal and the detection of the gamma-ray burst, its total isotropic energy, and the parameters of the red and blue components of the accompanying kilonova.

authors: Marko Ristic (1), Elizabeth Champion (1), Richard O'Shaughnessy (1), Ryan Wollaeger (2), Oleg Korobkin (2), Eve A. Chase (2 and 3), Christopher L. Fryer 
topic: Detailed radiative transfer simulations of kilonovae are difficult to apply directly to observations; they only sparsely cover simulation parameters, such as the mass, velocity, morphology, and composition of the ejecta. On the other hand, semianalytic models for kilonovae can be evaluated continuously over model parameters, but neglect important physical details which are not incorporated in the simulations, thus introducing systematic bias. Starting with a grid of 2D anisotropic simulations of kilonova light curves covering a wide range of ejecta properties, we apply adaptive-learning techniques to iteratively choose new simulations and produce high-fidelity surrogate models for those simulations. These surrogate models allow for continuous evaluation across model parameters while retaining the microphysical details about the ejecta. Using a new code for multimessenger inference, we demonstrate how to use our interpolated models to infer kilonova parameters. Comparing to inferences using simplified analytic models, we recover different ejecta properties. We discuss the implications of this analysis which is qualitatively consistent with similar previous work using detailed ejecta opacity calculations and which illustrates systematic challenges for kilonova modeling. An associated data and code release provides our interpolated light-curve models, interpolation implementation which can be applied to reproduce our work or extend to new models, and our multimessenger parameter inference engine.

title: Constraints on the dense matter equation of state and neutron star properties from NICER's mass-radius estimate of PSR J0740+6620 and multimessenger observations
authors: G. Raaijmakers, S. K. Greif, K. Hebeler, T. Hinderer, S. Nissanke, A. Schwenk, T. E. Riley, A. L. Watts, J. M. Lattimer, W. C. G. Ho
topic: In recent years our understanding of the dense matter equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars has significantly improved by analyzing multimessenger data from radio/X-ray pulsars, gravitational wave events, and from nuclear physics constraints. Here we study the additional impact on the EOS from the jointly estimated mass and radius of PSR J0740+6620, presented in Riley et al. (2021) by analyzing a combined dataset from X-ray telescopes NICER and XMM-Newton. We employ two different high-density EOS parameterizations: a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model and a model based on the speed of sound in a neutron star (CS). At nuclear densities these are connected to microscopic calculations of neutron matter based on chiral effective field theory interactions. In addition to the new NICER data for this heavy neutron star, we separately study constraints from the radio timing mass measurement of PSR J0740+6620, the gravitational wave events of binary neutron stars GW190425 and GW170817, and for the latter the associated kilonova AT2017gfo. By combining all these, and the NICER mass-radius estimate of PSR J0030+0451 we find the radius of a 1.4 solar mass neutron star to be constrained to the 95\% credible ranges 12.33+0.76-0.81 km (PP model) and 12.18+0.56-0.79 km (CS model). In addition, we explore different chiral effective field theory calculations and show that the new NICER results provide tight constraints for the pressure of neutron star matter at around twice saturation density, which shows the power of these observations to constrain dense matter interactions at intermediate densities.

title: A NICER View of the Massive Pulsar PSR J0740+6620 Informed by Radio Timing and XMM-Newton Spectroscopy
authors: Thomas E. Riley, Anna L. Watts, Paul S. Ray et al
topic: We report on Bayesian estimation of the radius, mass, and hot surface regions of the massive millisecond pulsar PSR J0740+6620, conditional on pulse-profile modeling of Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer X-ray Timing Instrument (NICER XTI) event data. We condition on informative pulsar mass, distance, and orbital inclination priors derived from the joint NANOGrav and CHIME/Pulsar wideband radio timing measurements of arXiv:2104.00880. We use XMM European Photon Imaging Camera spectroscopic event data to inform our X-ray likelihood function. The prior support of the pulsar radius is truncated at 16 km to ensure coverage of current dense matter models. We assume conservative priors on instrument calibration uncertainty. We constrain the equatorial radius and mass of PSR J0740+6620 to be 12.39+1.30−0.98 km and 2.072+0.067−0.066 M⊙ respectively, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the 16% and 84% quantiles, conditional on surface hot regions that are non-overlapping spherical caps of fully-ionized hydrogen atmosphere with uniform effective temperature; a posteriori, the temperature is log10(T [K])=5.99+0.05−0.06 for each hot region. All software for the X-ray modeling framework is open-source and all data, model, and sample information is publicly available, including analysis notebooks and model modules in the Python language. Our marginal likelihood function of mass and equatorial radius is proportional to the marginal joint posterior density of those parameters (within the prior support) and can thus be computed from the posterior samples.

title: The Radius of PSR J0740+6620 from NICER and XMM-Newton Data
authors: M. C. Miller, F. K. Lamb, A. J. Dittmann, S. Bogdanov, et al 
topic: PSR J0740+6620 has a gravitational mass of 2.08pm0.07 Msun, which is the highest reliably determined mass of any neutron star. As a result, a measurement of its radius will provide unique insight into the properties of neutron star core matter at high densities. Here we report a radius measurement based on fits of rotating hot spot patterns to Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) X-ray observations. We find that the equatorial circumferential radius of PSR J0740+6620 is 13.7+2.6−1.5 km (68\%). We apply our measurement, combined with the previous NICER mass and radius measurement of PSR J0030+0451, the masses of two other 2 Msun pulsars, and the tidal deformability constraints from two gravitational wave events, to three different frameworks for equation of state modeling, and find consistent results at 1.5−3 times nuclear saturation density. For a given framework, when all measurements are included the radius of a 1.4 Msun neutron star is known to 4\% (68\% credibility) and the radius of a 2.08 Msun neutron star is known to 5\%. The full radius range that spans the 1σ credible intervals of all the radius estimates in the three frameworks is 12.45pm0.65 km for a 1.4 Msun neutron star and 12.35pm0.75 km for a 2.08 Msun neutron star.

topic: We report the detection of X-ray pulsations from the rotation-powered millisecond-period pulsars PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J1614-2230, two of the most massive neutron stars known, using observations with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We also analyze X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton) data for both pulsars to obtain their time-averaged fluxes and study their respective X-ray fields. PSR J0740+6620 exhibits a broad double-peaked profile with a separation of 0.4 in phase. PSR J1614-2230, on the other hand, has a broad single-peak profile. The broad modulations with soft X-ray spectra of both pulsars are indicative of thermal radiation from one or more small regions of the stellar surface. We show the NICER detections of X-ray pulsations for both pulsars and also discuss the phase relationship to their radio pulsations. In the case of PSR J0740+6620, this paper documents the data reduction performed to obtain the pulsation detection and prepare for pulse profile modeling analysis.

title: Photospheric Prompt Emission From Long Gamma Ray Burst Simulations -- I. Optical Emission
authors: Tyler Parsotan, Davide Lazzati
topic: A complete understanding of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) has been difficult to achieve due to our incomplete knowledge of the radiation mechanism that is responsible for producing the prompt emission. This emission, which is detected in the first tens of seconds of the GRB, is typically dominated by hard X-ray and gamma ray photons although, there have also been a few dozen prompt optical detections. These optical detections have the potential to discriminate between plausible prompt emission models, such as the photospheric and synchrotron shock models. In this work we use an improved MCRaT code, which includes cyclo-synchrotron emission and absorption, to conduct radiative transfer calculations from optical to gamma ray energies under the photospheric model. The calculations are conducted using a set of two dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic long GRB jet simulations, consisting of a constant and variable jet. We find that correlations between the optical and gamma ray light curves can provide insight into the observer viewer angle as well as the variability of GRB jets. Furthermore, we find that there should be optical prompt precursors that precedes the main gamma ray emission for observers located far from the jet axis. Additionally, the detected optical emission originates from dense regions of the outflow such as shock interfaces and the jet-cocoon interface. These results show the importance of conducting global radiative transfer simulations using hydrodynamically calculated jet structures as well as the potential information that optical prompt detections can provide on GRB jets under the photospheric model.

title: Modelling neutron star mountains in relativity
authors: F. Gittins, N. Andersson
topic: Rapidly spinning, deformed neutron stars have long been considered potential gravitational-wave emitters. However, so far only upper limits on the size of the involved quadrupole deformations have been obtained. For this reason, it is pertinent to ask how large a mountain can be before the neutron star crust fractures. This is the question we consider in this paper, which describes how mountains can be calculated in relativistic gravity. Formally, such a calculation requires a fiducial force to source the mountain. Therefore, we consider three simple examples and increase their deforming amplitudes until the crust yields. We demonstrate how the derived mountains depend on the equation of state by considering a range of models obtained from chiral effective field theory. We find that the largest mountains depend sensitively on both the mechanism that sources them and the nuclear-matter equation of state.

title: Advances in Machine and Deep Learning for Modeling and Real-time Detection of Multi-Messenger Sources
authors: E. A. Huerta, Zhizhen Zhao
topic: We live in momentous times. The science community is empowered with an arsenal of cosmic messengers to study the Universe in unprecedented detail. Gravitational waves, electromagnetic waves, neutrinos and cosmic rays cover a wide range of wavelengths and time scales. Combining and processing these datasets that vary in volume, speed and dimensionality requires new modes of instrument coordination, funding and international collaboration with a specialized human and technological infrastructure. In tandem with the advent of large-scale scientific facilities, the last decade has experienced an unprecedented transformation in computing and signal processing algorithms. The combination of graphics processing units, deep learning, and the availability of open source, high-quality datasets, have powered the rise of artificial intelligence. This digital revolution now powers a multi-billion dollar industry, with far-reaching implications in technology and society. In this chapter we describe pioneering efforts to adapt artificial intelligence algorithms to address computational grand challenges in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics. We review the rapid evolution of these disruptive algorithms, from the first class of algorithms introduced in early 2017, to the sophisticated algorithms that now incorporate domain expertise in their architectural design and optimization schemes. We discuss the importance of scientific visualization and extreme-scale computing in reducing time-to-insight and obtaining new knowledge from the interplay between models and data.

title: Jets and spectral states with three-components of accretion flow around a black hole
authors: Rajiv Kumar, Ye-Fei Yuan
topic: It is generally believed that high energy radiation (power-law components) can be mostly produced by a hot corona gas in the accreting black holes. There is a very popular hybrid disk radial coupling model that the inner part of cool Keplerian disk (or Shakura-Sunyaev disk) can produce advection-dominated accretion flow or corona-like structure, which can also generate outflows/jets. Here we argue that this simple coupling model cannot explain the whole hardness-intensity diagram of the spectral states and their transitions, and associated jets of a X−ray binary. Based on recent theoretical works on advective disk structures around a black hole, as well as many observational behaviors of a source, we conclude that there should be a third component of hot accretion flow with the radial coupling model, which can successfully explain all the spectral states and transitions. Interestingly, this model also provides a new scenario for the jet generation, launching, and evolution during the states with help of created barrier of the inner flow. We have also find out the jet kinetic power expression with our new jet generation scenario.

title: Binary neutron star merger in common envelope jet supernovae
authors: Noam Soker (Technion, Israel)
topic: I explore a triple-star scenario where a tight neutron star (NS) - NS binary system enters the envelope of a red supergiant (RSG) star and spirals-in towards its core. The two NSs accrete mass through accretion disks and launch jets that power a very luminous and long transient event, a common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) event. Dynamical friction brings the two NSs to merge either in the RSG envelope or core. The total energy of the event, radiation and kinetic, is 10^{52}erg. The light curve stays luminous for months to years and a signal of gravitational waves might be detected. The ejecta contains freshly synthesized r-process elements not only from the NS-NS merger as in kilonova events, but possibly also from the pre-merger jets that the NSs launch inside the core, as in the r-process CEJSN scenario. This scenario shortens the time to NS-NS merger compared with that of kilonovae, and might somewhat ease the problem of the NS-NS r-process scenario to account for r-process nucleosynthesis in the early Universe. I estimate the ratio of NS-NS merger in CEJSN events to core collapse supernova (CCSN) events to be 10^{-6}-2x10^{-5}. However, because they are much more luminous I expect their detection fraction to that of CCSNe to be much larger than this number. This study calls for considering this and similar CEJSN scenarios in binary and in triple star systems when explaining peculiar and puzzling super luminous supernovae.

title: Jeffrey M. Berryman, Susan Gardner
authors: Jeffrey M. Berryman, Susan Gardner
topic: The discovery of non-diffuse sources of gravitational waves through compact-object mergers opens new prospects for the study of physics beyond the Standard Model. In this Letter, we consider the implications of the observation of GW190814, involving a coalescence of a black hole with a ∼2.6 Msun compact object, which may be too massive to be a neutron star, given our current knowledge of the nuclear matter equation of state. We consider the possibility of a new force between quarks, suggested in other contexts, that modifies the neutron star equation of state, particularly at supranuclear densities. We evaluate how this modification can impact a neutron star's mass and radius to make the observed heavy compact object more probably a neutron star, rather than a black hole, and suggest that further such objects may yet be found. We note the terrestrial and astrophysical measurements that could confirm our picture.

title: Supernova luminosity powered by magnetar-disk system
authors: Weili Lin, Xiaofeng Wang, Lingjun Wang, Zigao Dai
topic: Magnetars are one of the potential power sources for some energetic supernova explosions such as type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe I) and broad-lined type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL). In order to explore the possible link between these two subclasses of supernovae (SNe), we study the effect of fallback accretion disk on magnetar evolution and magnetar-powered SNe. In this scenario, the interaction between a magnetar and a fallback accretion disk would accelerate the spin of the magnetar in the accretion regime but could result in substantial spin-down of the magnetars in the propeller regime. Thus, the initial rotation of the magnetar plays a less significant role in the spin evolution. Such a magnetar-disk interaction scenario can explain well the light curves of both SNe Ic-BL and SLSNe I, for which the observed differences are sensitive to the initial magnetic field of the magnetar and the fallback mass and timescale for the disk. Compared to the magnetars powering the SNe Ic-BL, those accounting for more luminous SNe usually maintain faster rotation and have relatively lower effective magnetic fields around peak time. In addition, the association between SLSNe I and long gamma-ray bursts, if observed in the future, could be explained in the context of magnetar-disk system.

title: r-Process Radioisotopes from Near-Earth Supernovae and Kilonovae
authors: Xilu Wang, Adam M. Clark, John Ellis, Adrienne F. Ertel, Brian D. Fields, Zhenghai Liu, Jesse A. Miller, Rebecca Surman
topic: The astrophysical sites where r-process elements are synthesized remain mysterious: it is clear that neutron-star mergers (kilonovae, KNe) contribute, and some classes of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are also likely sources of at least the lighter r-process species. The discovery of the live isotope Fe60 on the Earth and Moon implies that one or more astrophysical explosions occurred near the Earth within the last few Myr, probably a SN. Intriguingly, several groups have reported evidence for deposits of Pu244, some overlapping with the Fe60 pulse. However, the putative Pu244 flux appears to extend to at least 12 Myr ago, pointing to a different origin. Motivated by this observation, we propose that ejecta from a KN enriched the giant molecular cloud that gave rise to the Local Bubble in which the Sun resides. Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) measurements of Pu244 and searches for other live isotopes could probe the origins of the r-process and the history of the solar neighborhood, including triggers for mass extinctions, e.g., at the end of the Devonian epoch, motivating the calculations of the abundances of live r-process radioisotopes produced in SNe and KNe that we present here. Given the presence of Pu244, other r-process species such as Zr93, Pd107, I129, Cs135, Hf182, U236, Np237 and Cm247 should be present. Their abundances could distinguish between SN and KN scenarios, and we discuss prospects for their detection in deep-ocean deposits and the lunar regolith. We show that AMS I129 measurements in Fe-Mn crusts already constrain a possible nearby KN scenario.

title: Multimessenger constraints for ultra-dense matter
authors: Eemeli Annala, Tyler Gorda, Evangelia Katerini, Aleksi Kurkela, Joonas Nättilä, Vasileios Paschalidis, Aleksi Vuorinen
topic: Recent rapid progress in multimessenger observations of neutron stars (NSs) offers great potential to constrain the properties of strongly interacting matter under the most extreme conditions. In order to fully exploit the current observational inputs and to study the impact of future observations, we analyze a large ensemble of randomly generated model-independent equations of state (EoSs) and the corresponding rotating stellar structures without the use of quasi-universal relations. We discuss the compatibility and the impact on the EoS of various hypotheses and measurements, including those involving the merger product in GW170817, the binary merger components in GW190814, and radius measurements of PSR J0740+6620. We obtain an upper limit for the dimensionless spin of a rigidly rotating NS, |chi| < 0.84, and find that the conservative hypothesis that the remnant in GW170817 ultimately collapsed to a black hole strongly constrains the EoS and the maximal mass of NSs, implying M_TOV < 2.53M_sol (or M_TOV < 2.19M_sol if we assume that a hypermassive NS was created). Furthermore, we find that radius measurements of massive NSs stars can dramatically limit the EoS, with strict lower limits around 12 km and above offering particularly efficient constraints. Finally, we find that radius values for a two-solar mass NS around 11-13 km would be completely compatible with the presence of quark matter inside massive NSs.

topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the brightest and most energetic events in the universe. The duration and hardness distribution of GRBs has two clusters, now understood to reflect (at least) two different progenitors. Short-hard GRBs (SGRBs; T90 <2 s) arise from compact binary mergers, while long-soft GRBs (LGRBs; T90 >2 s) have been attributed to the collapse of peculiar massive stars (collapsars). The discovery of SN 1998bw/GRB 980425 marked the first association of a LGRB with a collapsar and AT 2017gfo/GRB 170817A/GW170817 marked the first association of a SGRB with a binary neutron star merger, producing also gravitational wave (GW). Here, we present the discovery of ZTF20abwysqy (AT2020scz), a fast-fading optical transient in the Fermi Satellite and the InterPlanetary Network (IPN) localization regions of GRB 200826A; X-ray and radio emission further confirm that this is the afterglow. Follow-up imaging (at rest-frame 16.5 days) reveals excess emission above the afterglow that cannot be explained as an underlying kilonova (KN), but is consistent with being the supernova (SN). Despite the GRB duration being short (rest-frame T90 of 0.65 s), our panchromatic follow-up data confirms a collapsar origin. GRB 200826A is the shortest LGRB found with an associated collapsar; it appears to sit on the brink between a successful and a failed collapsar. Our discovery is consistent with the hypothesis that most collapsars fail to produce ultra-relativistic jets.

topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been phenomenologically classified into long and short populations based on the observed bimodal distribution of duration. Multi-wavelength and multi-messenger observations in recent years have revealed that in general long GRBs originate from massive star core collapse events, whereas short GRBs originate from binary neutron star mergers. It has been known that the duration criterion is sometimes unreliable, and multi-wavelength criteria are needed to identify the physical origin of a particular GRB. Some apparently long GRBs have been suggested to have a neutron star merger origin, whereas some apparently short GRBs have been attributed to genuinely long GRBs whose short, bright emission is slightly above the detector's sensitivity threshold. Here we report the comprehensive analysis of the multi-wavelength data of a bright short GRB 200826A. Characterized by a sharp pulse, this burst shows a duration of 1 second and no evidence of an underlying longer-duration event. Its other observational properties such as its spectral behaviors, total energy, and host galaxy offset, are, however, inconsistent with those of other short GRBs believed to originate from binary neutron star mergers. Rather, these properties resemble those of long GRBs. This burst confirms the existence of short duration GRBs with stellar core-collapse origin, and presents some challenges to the existing models.

title: Modeling the Linear Polarization of GRB Afterglows Across the Electromagnetic Spectrum
authors: Gal Birenbaum, Omer Bromberg
topic: Linear polarization measurements in the optical band show polarization degrees of a few percent at late times. Recently, polarization at sub-percent level was also detected in radio by ALMA, opening the window for multi-wavelength polarimetry and stressing the importance of properly modeling polarization in GRB afterglows across the EM spectrum. We introduce a numerical tool that can calculate the polarization from relativistically moving surfaces by discretizing them to small patches of uniform magnetic field, calculating the polarized emission from each cell assuming synchrotron radiation and summing it to obtain the total degree of polarization. We apply this tool to afterglow shocks with random magnetic fields confined to the shock plane, considering electron radiative cooling. We analyze the observed polarization curves in several wavelengths above the cooling frequency and below the minimal synchrotron frequency and point to the characteristic differences between them. We present a method to constrain the jet opening angle and the viewing angle within the context of our model. Applying it to GRB 021004 we obtain angles of 10 and 8 degrees respectively and conclude that a non-negligible component of radial magnetic field is required to explain the 1% polarization level observed 3.5 days after the burst.

title: Simulating the dynamics and synchrotron emission from relativistic jets II. Evolution of non-thermal electrons
authors: Dipanjan Mukherjee, Gianluigi Bodo, Paola Rossi, Andrea Mignone, Bhargav Vaidya
topic: We have simulated the evolution of non-thermal cosmic ray electrons (CREs) in 3D relativistic magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) jets evolved up to a height of 9 kpc. The CREs have been evolved in space and in energy concurrently with the relativistic jet fluid, duly accounting for radiative losses and acceleration at shocks. We show that jets stable to MHD instabilities show expected trends of regular flow of CREs in the jet spine and acceleration at a hotspot followed by a settling backflow. However, unstable jets create complex shock structures at the jet-head (kink instability), the jet spine-cocoon interface and the cocoon itself (Kelvin-Helmholtz modes). CREs after exiting jet-head undergo further shock crossings in such scenarios and are re-accelerated in the cocoon. CREs with different trajectories in turbulent cocoons have different evolutionary history with different spectral parameters. Thus at the same spatial location, there is mixing of different CRE populations, resulting in a complex total CRE spectrum when averaged over a given area. Cocoons of unstable jets can have an excess build up of energetic electrons due to re-acceleration at turbulence driven shocks and slowed expansion of the decelerated jet. This will add to the non-thermal energy budget of the cocoon.

title: The Polarized Image of a Synchrotron Emitting Ring of Gas Orbiting a Black Hole
authors: Ramesh Narayan, Daniel C. M. Palumbo, Michael D. Johnson et al
topic: Synchrotron radiation from hot gas near a black hole results in a polarized image. The image polarization is determined by effects including the orientation of the magnetic field in the emitting region, relativistic motion of the gas, strong gravitational lensing by the black hole, and parallel transport in the curved spacetime. We explore these effects using a simple model of an axisymmetric, equatorial accretion disk around a Schwarzschild black hole. By using an approximate expression for the null geodesics derived by Beloborodov (2002) and conservation of the Walker-Penrose constant, we provide analytic estimates for the image polarization. We test this model using currently favored general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of M87star, using ring parameters given by the simulations. For a subset of these with modest Faraday effects, we show that the ring model broadly reproduces the polarimetric image morphology. Our model also predicts the polarization evolution for compact flaring regions, such as those observed from Sgr A.star with GRAVITY. With suitably chosen parameters, our simple model can reproduce the EVPA pattern and relative polarized intensity in Event Horizon Telescope images of M87star. Under the physically motivated assumption that the magnetic field trails the fluid velocity, this comparison is consistent with the clockwise rotation inferred from total intensity images.

title: Late-time radio observations of the short GRB200522A: constraints on the magnetar model
authors: G. Bruni, B. O'Connor, T. Matsumoto, E. Troja, T. Piran, L. Piro, R. Ricci
topic: GRB200522A is a short duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) at redshift z=0.554 characterized by a bright infrared counterpart. A possible, although not unambiguous, interpretation of the observed emission is the onset of a luminous kilonova powered by a rapidly rotating and highly-magnetized neutron star, known as magnetar. A bright radio flare, arising from the interaction of the kilonova ejecta with the surrounding medium, is a prediction of this model. Whereas the available dataset remains open to multiple interpretations (e.g. afterglow, r-process kilonova, magnetar-powered kilonova), long-term radio monitoring of this burst may be key to discriminate between models. We present our late-time upper limit on the radio emission of GRB200522A, carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 288 days after the burst. For kilonova ejecta with energy Eej≈1053erg, as expected for a long-lived magnetar remnant, we can already rule out ejecta masses Mej \leq 0.03Msun for the most likely range of circumburst densities n\geq 10-3 cm-3. Observations on timescales of 3-10 yr after the merger will probe larger ejecta masses up to Mej∼0.1Msun, providing a robust test to the magnetar scenario.

authors: U. Geppert, R. Basu, D. Mitra, G. Melikidze, M.Szkudlarek
topic: The radio emission in many pulsars show sudden changes, usually within a period, that cannot be related to the steady state processes within the inner acceleration region (IAR) above the polar cap. These changes are often quasi-periodic in nature, where regular transitions between two or more stable emission states are seen. The durations of these states show a wide variety ranging from several seconds to hours at a time. There are strong, small scale magnetic field structures and huge temperature gradients present at the polar cap surface. We have considered several processes that can cause temporal modifications of the local magnetic field structure and strength at the surface of the polar cap. Using different magnetic field strengths and scales, and also assuming realistic scales of the temperature gradients, the evolutionary timescales of different phenomena affecting the surface magnetic field was estimated. We find that the Hall drift results in faster changes in comparison to both Ohmic decay and thermoelectric effects. A mechanism based on the Partially Screened Gap (PSG) model of the IAR has been proposed, where the Hall and thermoelectric oscillations perturb the polar cap magnetic field to alter the sparking process in the PSG. This is likely to affect the observed radio emission resulting in the observed state changes

title: The role of jet-cocoon mixing, magnetization and shock breakout in neutrino and cosmic-ray emission from short GRBs
authors: Ore Gottlieb, Noemie Globus
topic: We perform GRMHD and RMHD simulations of weakly and highly magnetized gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets propagating in binary neutron star (BNS) merger ejecta. Using the simulations, we first find that mixing between the jet and cocoon, which is present in all types of jets, inhibits the formation of subphotospheric collisionless shocks. However, we show that a mild magnetization may lead to the formation of collisionless subshocks which allow efficient proton acceleration. We consider shear acceleration and diffusive shock acceleration at collimation shocks, internal shocks, shock breakout, and external shocks, to provide the first self-consistent estimate for neutrino and cosmic-ray (CR) signals from GRBs in BNS mergers. We find that short GRBs do not produce detectable neutrino signals with current-day facilities. Shock breakout yields 10 PeV neutrinos at viewing angles 20deg, independent of the jet magnetization. However, a neutrino signal from shock breakout is well below detection limits of current detectors. Such a signal would allow a coincident neutrino-γ−ray detection, providing a testable prediction for shock breakout as a neutrino production site. Using the numerical modeling that fits GW170817 afterglow emission, we find that blast waves in BNS mergers can account for 5%\-10\% of the Galactic CR luminosity in the PeV-EeV energy range. Based on these estimates, the observed level of CR anisotropy places a constraint on the distance of the latest Galactic binary neutron star merger to ≲3 kiloparsecs.

title: Magnetic angle evolution in accreting neutron stars
authors: Anton Biryukov, Pavel Abolmasov
topic: The rotation of a magnetised accreting neutron star (NS) in a binary system is described by its spin period and two angles: spin inclination alpha with respect to the orbital momentum and magnetic angle chi between the spin and the magnetic moment. Magnetospheric accretion spins the NS up and adjusts its rotation axis, decreasing alpha to nearly perfect alignment. Its effect upon the magnetic angle is more subtle and relatively unstudied. In this work, we model the magnetic angle evolution of a rigid spherical accreting NS. We find that the torque spinning the NS up may affect the magnetic angle while both alpha and chi significantly deviate from zero, and the spin-up torque varies with the phase of the spin period. As the rotation axis of the NS is being aligned with the spin-up torque, the magnetic axis becomes misaligned with the rotation axis. Under favourable conditions, magnetic angle may increase by 20 percent. This orthogonalisation may be an important factor in the evolution of millisecond pulsars, as it partially compensates the chi decrease potentially caused by pulsar torques. If the direction of the spin-up torque changes randomly with time, as in wind-fed high-mass X-ray binaries, both the rotation axis of the NS and its magnetic axis become involved in a non-linear random-walk evolution. The ultimate attractor of this process is a bimodal distribution in chi peaking.

title: X-ray Emission from Isolated Neutron Stars revisited: 3D magnetothermal simulations
authors: Davide De Grandis, Roberto Taverna, Roberto Turolla, Andrea Gnarini, Sergei B. Popov, Silvia Zane, Toby S. Wood
topic: X-ray emission from the surface of isolated neutron stars (NSs) has been now observed in a variety of sources. The ubiquitous presence of pulsations clearly indicates that thermal photons either come from a limited area, possibly heated by some external mechanism, or from the entire (cooling) surface but with an inhomogeneous temperature distribution. In a NS the thermal map is shaped by the magnetic field topology, since heat flows in the crust mostly along the magnetic field lines. Self-consistent surface thermal maps can hence be produced by simulating the coupled magnetic and thermal evolution of the star. We compute the evolution of the neutron star crust in three dimensions for different initial configurations of the magnetic field and use the ensuing thermal surface maps to derive the spectrum and the pulse profile as seen by an observer at infinity, accounting for general-relativistic effects. In particular, we compare cases with a high degree of symmetry with inherently 3D ones, obtained by adding a quadrupole to the initial dipolar field. Axially symmetric fields result in rather small pulsed fractions, while more complex configurations produce higher pulsed fractions, up to 25%. We find that the spectral properties of our axisymmetric model are close to those of the bright isolated NS RX J1856.5-3754 at an evolutionary time comparable with the inferred dynamical age of the source.

title: Three-dimensional core-collapse supernovae with complex magnetic structures: I. Explosion dynamics
authors: Matteo Bugli, Jérôme Guilet, Martin Obergaulinger
topic: Magnetic fields can play a major role in the dynamics of outstanding explosions associated to violent events such as GRBs and hypernovae, since they provide a natural mechanism to harness the rotational energy of the central proto-neutron star and power relativistic jets through the stellar progenitor. As the structure of such fields is quite uncertain, most numerical models of MHD-driven core-collapse supernovae consider an aligned dipole as initial magnetic field, while the field's morphology can actually be much more complex. We present three-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae with more realistic magnetic structures, such as quadrupolar fields and, for the first time, a tilted dipolar field. Configurations other than an aligned dipole produce weaker explosions and less collimated outflows, but can at the same time be more efficient in extracting the rotational energy from the PNS. This energy is then stored in the surroundings of the PNS, rather than powering the polar jets. A significant axial dipolar component is also produced by models starting with a quadrupolar field, pointing to an effective dynamo mechanism operating in proximity of the PNS surface.

title: Imprints of Gravitational Microlensing on the Light Curve of Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Zeinab Kalantari, Alaa Ibrahim, Mohammad Reza Rahimi Tabar, Sohrab Rahvar
topic: In this work, we search for signatures of gravitational microlensing in Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) in which the source-lens-observer geometry produces two images that manifest in the GRB light curve as superimposed peaks with identical temporal variability (or echoes), separated by the time delay between the two images. We consider microlensing events due to point mass lenses in the range of 105−107Msun at lens redshift about half that of the GRB, with a time delay in the order of 10 seconds. Current GRB observatories are capable of resolving and constraining this lensing scenario if the above conditions are met. We investigated the Fermi/GBM GRB archive during 2008 to 2020 using the autocorrelation technique and we found one microlensed GRB candidate out of 2965 GRBs searched, which we use to estimate the optical depth of microlensed GRBs by performing a Monte-Carlo simulation to find the efficiency of our detection method. Considering a point mass model for the gravitational lens, where the lens is a supermassive black hole, we show that the density parameter of black holes (ΩBH) with mass \sim 106M⊙ is about 8x10-4. Our result is consist with a previous work in a lower mass range (102−103M⊙), which gave a density parameter ΩBH≈5×10−4, and a recent work in the mass range of 102-107Msun that reported. If this black hole is considered to be a primordial black hole, we can estimate the fraction of dark matter contribution to the primordial black holes as/

title: GRBs luminosity function synthesized from \textit{Swift/BAT}, \textit{Fermi/GBM} and \textit{Konus-Wind} data
authors: Hannachi Zitouni, Nidhal Guessoum, Walid Jamel Azzam, Yassine Benturki
topic: We study the luminosity function of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) using the peak flux obtained from three LGRB samples with known redshifts: (a) a sample of 251 LGRBs from the \textit{Swift/BAT} satellite/instrument; (b) a sample of 37 LGRBs from the \textit{Fermi/GBM} telescope; (c) a sample of 152 GRBs from the \textit{Konus-Wind} instrument. For the \textit{Swift/BAT} and \textit{Fermi/GBM} samples, we use data available on the Swift Burst Analyser websites (\url{this http URL}; \citep{Evans:2010}) and (\url{this http URL}) and on the Fermi website (\url{this https URL}\url{W3Browse /fermi /fermigbrst.html}; \citep{{Gruber_2014}, {von_Kienlin_2014}, {Bhat_2016}}) to calculate the luminosity at the peak of the flux by using a cut-off power-law spectrum (CPL). For the \textit{Konus-Wind} sample, we use the Yonetoku correlation relationship \citep{Yonetoku:2010} to determine the isotropic luminosity from the energy at the peak of the flux measured in the source frame \citep{Minaev:2019}. With these three samples (totalling 439 GRBs), we use the Monte Carlo method to synthesize 10,000 "artificial" GRBs similar to each real GRB by considering that each physical quantity observed obeys a normal distribution, where the tabulated value and uncertainty represent the mean and the 3σ error. The results obtained for the luminosity function from our data samples are consistent with those published in previous works.

title: The missing link in gravitational-wave astronomy: A summary of discoveries waiting in the decihertz range
authors: Manuel Arca Sedda, Christopher P L Berry, Karan Jani, Pau Amaro-Seoane, Pierre Auclair, et al
topic: Since 2015 the gravitational-wave observations of LIGO and Virgo have transformed our understanding of compact-object binaries. In the years to come, ground-based gravitational-wave observatories such as LIGO, Virgo, and their successors will increase in sensitivity, discovering thousands of stellar-mass binaries. In the 2030s, the space-based LISA will provide gravitational-wave observations of massive black holes binaries. Between the 10-103 Hz band of ground-based observatories and the 10−4-10-1 Hz band of LISA lies the uncharted decihertz gravitational-wave band. We propose a Decihertz Observatory to study this frequency range, and to complement observations made by other detectors. Decihertz observatories are well suited to observation of intermediate-mass (102-104Msun) black holes; they will be able to detect stellar-mass binaries days to years before they merge, providing early warning of nearby binary neutron star mergers and measurements of the eccentricity of binary black holes, and they will enable new tests of general relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. Here we summarise how a Decihertz Observatory could provide unique insights into how black holes form and evolve across cosmic time, improve prospects for both multimessenger astronomy and multiband gravitational-wave astronomy, and enable new probes of gravity, particle physics and cosmology.

title: Late Afterglow Bump/Plateau around the Jet Break: Signature of a free-to-shocked wind Environment in Gamma-ray Burst
authors: Xiao-Yan Li, Da-Bin Lin, Jia Ren, Shu-Jin Hou, Yu-Fei Li, Xiang-Gao Wang, En-Wei Liang
topic: A number of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibit the late simultaneous bumps in their optical and Xray afterglows around the jet break. Its origin is unclear. Based on the following two facts, we suggest that this feature may sound a transition of circum-burst environment from a free-wind medium to a homogeneous medium. (I) The late bump followed by a steep decay is strongly reminiscent of the afterglows of GRB 170817A, which is attributed to an off-axis observed external-forward shock (eFS) propagating in an interstellar medium. (II) Observations seem to feature a long shallow decay before the late optical bump, which is different from the afterglow of GRB 170817A. In this paper, we study the emission of an eFS propagating in a free-to-shocked wind for on/off-axis observers, where the mass density in the shocked-wind is almost constant. The late simultaneous bumps/plateaux in the optical and X-ray afterglows are really found around the jet break for high-viewing-angle observers. Moreover, there is a long plateau or shallow decay before the late bump in the theoretical light-curves, which is formed during the eFS propagating in the free-wind. For low-viewing-angle observers, the above bumps appear only in the situation that the structured jet has a low characteristic angle and the deceleration radius of the on-axis jet flow is at around or beyond the free-wind boundary. As examples, the X-ray and optical afterglows of GRBs 120326A, 120404A, and 100814A are fitted. We find that an off-axis observed eFS in a free-to-shocked wind can well explain the afterglows in these bursts.

title: Models of binary neutron star remnants with tabulated equations of state
authors: Panagiotis Iosif, Nikolaos Stergioulas
topic: The emergence of novel differential rotation laws that can reproduce the rotational profile of binary neutron star merger remnants has opened the way for the construction of equilibrium models with properties that resemble those of remnants in numerical simulations. We construct models of merger remnants, using the 4-parameter differential rotation law by Uryu et al. (2017) and three tabulated, zero-temperature equations of state. The models have angular momenta that are determined by empirical relations, constructed through numerical simulations. After a systematic exploration of the parameter space of merger remnant equilibrium sequences, which includes the determination of turning points along constant-angular-momentum sequences, we find that a particular rotation law can reproduce the threshold mass to prompt collapse to a black hole with a relative difference of only 1% with respect to numerical simulations, in all cases considered. Furthermore, our results indicate a possible correlation between the compactness of equilibrium models of remnants at the threshold mass and the compactness of maximum-mass nonrotating models. Another key prediction of binary neutron star merger simulations is a relatively slowly rotating inner region, where the angular velocity (as measured by an observer at infinity) is mostly due to the frame dragging angular velocity. In our investigation of the parameter space of the Uryu+ rotation law, we naturally find quasi-spherical (Type A) remnant models with this property. Our investigation clarifies the impact of the differential rotation law and of the equation of state on key properties of binary neutron star remnants and lays the groundwork for including thermal effects in future studies.

title: Impact of massive neutron star radii on the nature of phase transitions in dense matter
authors: Rahul Somasundaram, Jérôme Margueron
topic: The last few years have seen tremendous progress in the observation of the global properties of neutron stars (NSs), e.g. masses, radii and tidal deformabilities. Such properties provide information about possible phase transitions in the inner cores of NSs, provided the connection between observed masses and radii and the equation of state (EoS) is well understood. We focus the present study on first-order phase transitions, which often softens the EoS and consequently reduces the maximum mass as well as the radii of NSs. Here, we challenge this conventional expectation by constructing explicit examples of EoSs undergoing a first-order phase transition, but which are much stiffer that their purely hadronic counterparts. We also provide comparisons with the recently proposed quarkyonic EoS which suggests a strong repulsion in the core of NSs, and we show that their stiffness can be realistically masqueraded by first-order phase transitions to exotic matter.

authors: E. Troja, B. O'Connor, G. Ryan, L. Piro, R. Ricci, B. Zhang, T. Piran, G. Bruni, S. B. Cenko, H. van Eerten
topic: X-ray emission from the gravitational wave transient GW170817 is well described as non-thermal afterglow radiation produced by a structured relativistic jet viewed off-axis. We show that the X-ray counterpart continues to be detected at 3.3 years after the merger. Such long-lasting signal is not a prediction of the earlier jet models characterized by a narrow jet core and a viewing angle of about 20 deg, and is spurring a renewed interest in the origin of the X-ray emission. We present a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray dataset aimed at clarifying existing discrepancies in the literature, and in particular the presence of an X-ray rebrightening at late times. Our analysis does not find evidence for an increase in the X-ray flux, but confirms a growing tension between the observations and the jet model. Further observations at radio and X-ray wavelengths would be critical to break the degeneracy between models.

authors: A. Rios, A. Pastore, C. Diget, A. M. Romero, K. Leech, P. Stokoe
topic: We introduce two simple online activities to explore the physics of neutron stars. These provide an introduction to the basic properties of compact objects, like their masses and radii, for secondary school students. The first activity explores the idea of the minimum mass of a neutron star. It is directly linked to the concept of binding energy and follows on from our previous activities. The second activity focuses on the maximum mass of neutron stars using a solvable model of the neutron star interior. The activities are based on spreadsheets, provided as Supplementary Material, and can be easily adapted to different levels, age groups and discussion topics. In particular, these activities can naturally lead towards discussions on extrapolations and limits of theoretical models.

title: Short gamma-ray burst jet propagation in binary neutron star merger environments
authors: Andrea Pavan, Riccardo Ciolfi, Jay Vijay Kalinani, Andrea Mignone
topic: The multimessenger event GW170817/GRB 170817A confirmed that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can produce short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) jets. This evidence promoted new investigations on the mechanisms through which a BNS merger remnant can launch such a powerful relativistic outflow and on the propagation of the latter across the surrounding post-merger environment. In particular, great strides have been made in jet propagation models, establishing connections between the initial jet launching conditions, including the incipient jet launching time (with respect to merger) and the injection parameters, and the observable SGRB prompt and afterglow emission. However, present semi-analytical models and numerical simulations (with one notable exception) adopt simple hand-made prescriptions to account for the post-merger environment, lacking a direct association with any specific merging BNS system. Here, we present the first three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of incipient SGRB jets propagating through a post-merger environment that is directly imported from the outcome of a previous general relativistic BNS merger simulation. Our results show that the evolution and final properties of the jet can be largely affected by the anisotropies and the deviations from axisymmetry and homologous expansion characterizing more realistic BNS merger environments. In addition, we find that the inclusion of the gravitational pull from the central compact object, often overlooked, can have a major impact. Finally, we consider different jet launching times referred to the same BNS merger model and discuss the consequences for the ultimate jet properties.

title: Multi-messenger Detection Rates and distributions of Binary Neutron Star Mergers and Their Cosmological Implications
authors: Jiming Yu, Haoran Song, Shunke Ai, He Gao, Fayin Wang, Yu Wang, Youjun Lu, Wenjuan Fang, Wen Zhao
topic: The gravitational-wave (GW) events, produced by the coalescence of binary neutron-stars (BNS), can be treated as the standard sirens to probe the expansion history of the Universe, if their redshifts could be determined from the electromagnetic observations. For the high-redshift events, the short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) and the afterglows are always considered as the primary electromagnetic counterparts. In this paper, by investigating various models of sGRBs and afterglows, we discuss the rates and distributions of BNS mergers' multi-messenger observations with GW detectors in second-generation (2G), 2.5G, 3G era with the detectable sGRBs and the afterglows. For instance, for Cosmic Explorer GW detector, the rate is about (300-3500) per year with GECAM-like detector for gamma-ray emissions and LSST/WFST detector for optical afterglows. In addition, we find these events have the redshifts small and the inclination angles. These results justify the rough estimation in previous works. Considering these events as standard sirens to constrain the equation-of-state parameters of dark energy and wa, we obtain the potential constraints of

title: Estimating the propagation of a uniformly accelerated jet
authors: J.I. Castorena, A.C. Raga, A. Esquivel, A. Rodríguez-González, L. Hernández-Martínez, J. Cantó, F. Clever
topic: We study the problem of a Herbig-Haro jet with a uniformly accelerating ejection velocity, travelling into a uniform environment. For the ejection density we consider two cases: a time-independent density, and a time-independent mass loss rate. For these two cases, we obtain analytic solutions for the motion of the jet head using a ram-pressure balance and a center of mass equation of motion. We also compute axisymmetric numerical simulations of the same flow, and compare the time-dependent positions of the leading working surface shocks with the predictions of the two analytic models. We find that if the jet is over-dense and over-pressured (with respect to the environment) during its evolution, a good agreement is obtained with the analytic models, with the flow initially following the center of mass analytic solution, and (for the constant ejection density case) at later times approaching the ram-pressure balance solution.

title: Spectral-temporal features of repeating ( one-off ) FRBs and Axion Star
authors: Aiichi Iwazaki
topic: The fast radio bursts ( FRBs ) are energetic radio bursts with millisecond duration only observed at radio frequencies. The generation mechanism is still mysterious. We have proposed a generation mechanism of both repeating and one-off FRBs. They arise from the axion star collision with neutron star or magnetized accretion disk of galactic black hole. Once we accept the existence of the axions, we find that the mechanism well explain previously observed spectral-temporal features. In this paper we show that it also explains recently observed phenomena such as downward drifting in the repeating FRBs, etc.. Analysis of the downward drifting based on Doppler effects has been presented in recent papers, in which a superradiance system of molecular or atom has been proposed as a source of FRBs. We apply the analysis to our mechanism and find that it well explains the relation between the downward drifting rate and the duration of the repeating FRBs. The Doppler effects lead to the fact that the duration of radio burst with higher center frequency is shorter than that of radio burst with lower center frequency in the repeating FRBs. Our generation mechanism naturally explain polarization angle swing observed in the repeating FRB180301 and one-off FRBs. We also discuss the association between the FRB200428 and magnetar SGR J1935+2154. The X ray burst observed just after the observation of the FRB could be triggered by the axion star collision with the magnetar. We also explain the consistency of our generation mechanism with observed spectral-temporal differences in the repeating and one-off FRBs, e.g. longer duration ( smaller flux density ) of repeating FRBs than duration ( flux density ) of one-off FRBs.

title: Black Hole Magnetic Fields and Their Imprint on Circular Polarization Images
authors: Angelo Ricarte, Richard Qiu, Ramesh Narayan
topic: The circular polarization of black hole accretion flows can encode properties of the underlying magnetic field structure. Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations, we study the imprint of magnetic field geometry on circular polarization images potentially observable by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). We decompose images into the different mechanisms that generate circular polarization in these models, which are sensitive to both the line of sight direction and twist of the magnetic field. In these models, a stable sign of the circular polarization over time, as observed for several sources, can be attributed to a stability of these properties. We illustrate how different aspects of a generic helical magnetic field geometry become imprinted on a circular polarization image. We also identify novel effects of light bending that affect the circular polarization image on event horizon scales. One consequence is the sign flipping of successive photon rings in face-on systems, which if observable and uncorrupted by Faraday rotation, can directly encode the handedness of the approaching magnetic field.

title: Nonlinear evolution of fast neutrino flavor conversion in the preshock region of core-collapse supernovae
authors: Masamichi Zaizen, Taiki Morinaga
topic: In environments with high dense neutrino gases, such as in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), the neutrinos can experience collective neutrino oscillation due to their self-interactions. In particular, fast flavor conversion driven by the crossings in the neutrino angular distribution can affect explosion mechanism, nucleosynthesis, and neutrino observation. We perform the numerical computation of nonlinear flavor evolution on the neutrino angular distribution with tiny crossings expected to be generated in the preshock region. We demonstrate that the fast instability is triggered and a cascade develops under a realistic three-flavor model considering muon production and weak magnetism in the SN dynamics. The tiny crossing excites specific spatial modes, and then the flavor instability propagates into other modes which otherwise remain stable due to the nonlinear effects. Our results indicate that fast flavor conversion can rise in the preshock region and have a sufficient impact on the flavor contents.

title: GRB jet structure and the jet break
authors: Gavin P Lamb, D. Alexander Kann, Joseph John Fernández, Ilya Mandel, Andrew J. Levan, Nial R. Tanvir
topic: We investigate the shape of the jet break in within-beam gamma-ray burst (GRB) optical afterglows for various lateral jet structure profiles. We consider cases with and without lateral spreading and a range of inclinations within the jet core half-opening angle, theta_c. We fit model and observed afterglow lightcurves with a smoothly-broken power-law function with a free-parameter Kappa that describes the sharpness of the break. We find that the jet break is sharper (kappa is greater) when lateral spreading is included than in the absence of lateral spreading. For profiles with a sharp-edged core, the sharpness parameter has a broad range of [0.1<κ<4.6], whereas profiles with a smooth-edged core have a narrower range of [0.1<κ<2.2] when models both with and without lateral spreading are included. For sharp-edged jets, the jet break sharpness depends strongly on the inclination of the system within theta core, whereas for smooth-edged jets, kappa is more strongly dependent on the size of theta c. Using a sample of 20 GRBs we find nine candidate smooth-edged jet structures and eight candidate sharp-edged jet structures, while the remaining three are consistent with either. The shape of the jet break, as measured by the sharpness parameter κ, can be used as an initial check for the presence of lateral structure in within-beam GRBs where the afterglow is well-sampled at and around the jet-break time.

In order to understand the phenomenon that emits these pulses, targeted and untargeted searches have been performed for multi-wavelength counterparts, including the optical. The objective of this work is to search for optical transients at the position of 8 well-localized FRBs, after the arrival of the burst on different time-scales (typically at one day, several months, and one year after FRB detection) in order to compare with known transient optical light curves. We used the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT), which allows us to promptly take images owing to its network of twenty-three telescopes working around the world. We used a template subtraction technique on all the images we collected at different epochs. We have divided the subtractions into two groups, in one group we use the image of the last epoch as a template and in the other group we use the image of the first epoch as a template. We have searched for bright optical transients at the localizations of the FRBs [<1 arcsec] in the template subtracted images. We have found no optical transients, so we have set limiting magnitudes of optical counterparts. Typical limiting magnitudes in apparent (absolute) magnitudes for our LCOGT data are ~22 (-19) mag in the r-band. We have compared our limiting magnitudes with light curves of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), type Ia supernovae (SNe), supernovae associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRB SNe), a kilonova, and tidal disruption events (TDEs). We rule out that FRBs are associated with SLSN at a confidence of ~99.9%. We can also rule out the brightest sub-types of type Ia SNe, GRB SNe and TDEs (under some conditions) at similar confidence, though we cannot exclude scenarios where FRBs are associated with the faintest sub-type of each of these transient classes.

title: Multi-Messenger Astrophysics with THESEUS in the 2030s
authors: Riccardo Ciolfi, Giulia Stratta, Marica Branchesi, Bruce Gendre, et al
topic: Multi-messenger astrophysics is becoming a major avenue to explore the Universe, with the potential to span a vast range of redshifts. The growing synergies between different probes is opening new frontiers, which promise profound insights into several aspects of fundamental physics and cosmology. In this context, THESEUS will play a central role during the 2030s in detecting and localizing the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave and neutrino sources that the unprecedented sensitivity of next generation detectors will discover at much higher rates than the present. Here, we review the most important target signals from multi-messenger sources that THESEUS will be able to detect and characterize, discussing detection rate expectations and scientific impact.

title: Rapid model comparison of equations of state from gravitational wave observation of binary neutron star coalescences
authors: Shaon Ghosh, Xiaoshu Liu, Jolien Creighton, Wolfgang Kastaun, Geraint Pratten, Ignacio Magana Hernandez
topic: The discovery of the coalescence of binary neutron star GW170817 was a watershed moment in the field of gravitational wave astronomy. Among the rich variety of information that we were able to uncover from this discovery was the first non-electromagnetic measurement of the neutron star radius, and the cold nuclear equation of state. It also led to a large equation of state model-selection study from gravitational-wave data. In those studies Bayesian nested sampling runs were conducted for each candidate equation of state model to compute their evidence in the gravitational-wave data. Such studies, though invaluable, are computationally expensive and require repeated, redundant, computation for any new models. We present a novel technique to conduct model-selection of equation of state in an extremely rapid fashion (minutes) on any arbitrary model. We test this technique against the results of a nested-sampling model-selection technique published earlier by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration, and show that the results are in good agreement with a median fractional error in Bayes factor of about 10%, where we assume that the true Bayes factor is calculated in the aforementioned nested sampling runs. We found that the highest fractional error occurs for equation of state models that have very little support in the posterior distribution, thus resulting in large statistical uncertainty. We then used this method to combine multiple binary neutron star mergers to compute a joint-Bayes factor between equation of state models. This is achieved by stacking the evidence of the individual events and computing the Bayes factor from these stacked evidences for each pairs of equation of state.

title: GAMMA: a new method for modeling relativistic hydrodynamics and non-thermal emission on a moving mesh
authors: Eliot H. Ayache, Hendrik J. van Eerten, Rupert W. Eardley
topic: In recent years, dynamical relativistic jet simulation techniques have progressed to a point where it is becoming possible to fully numerically resolve gamma-ray burst (GRB) blast-wave evolution across scales. However, the modeling of emission is currently lagging behind and limits our efforts to fully interpret the physics of GRBs. In this work we combine recent developments in moving-mesh relativistic dynamics with a local treatment of non-thermal emission in a new code: GAMMA. The code involves an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach only in the dominant direction of fluid motion which avoids mesh entanglement and associated computational costs. Shock detection, particle injection and local calculation of their evolution including radiative cooling are done at runtime. Even though GAMMA has been designed with GRB physics applications in mind, it is modular such that new solvers and geometries can be implemented easily with a wide range of potential applications. In this paper, we demonstrate the validity of our approach and compute accurate broadband GRB afterglow radiation from early to late times. Our results show that the spectral cooling break shifts by a factor of ~ 40 compared to existing methods. Its temporal behavior also significantly changes from the previously calculated temporary steep increase after the jet break. Instead, we find that the cooling break does not shift with time between the relativistic and Newtonian asymptotes when computed from our local algorithm.

title: Light Curves of Partial Tidal Disruption Events
authors: Jin-Hong Chen, Rong-Feng Shen
topic: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) can uncover the quiescent black holes (BHs) at the center of galaxies and also offer a promising method to study them. In a partial TDE (PTDE), the BH's tidal force cannot fully disrupt the star, so the stellar core survives and only a varied portion of the stellar mass is bound to the BH and feeds it. We calculate the event rate of PTDEs and full TDEs (FTDEs). In general, the event rate of PTDEs is higher than that of FTDEs, especially for the larger BHs. And the detection rate of PTDEs is about dozens per year by Zwicky Transient Factory (ZTF). During the circularization process of the debris stream in PTDEs, no outflow can be launched due to the efficient radiative diffusion. The circularized debris ring then experiences viscous evolution and forms an accretion disk. We calculate the light curves of PTDEs contributed by these two processes, along with their radiation temperature evolution. The light curves have double peaks and the spectra peak in UV. Without obscuration or reprocessing of the radiation by an outflow, PTDEs provide a clean environment to study the circularization and transient disk formation in TDEs.

title: Intermittency of Fast MHD Modes and Regions of Anomalous Gradient Orientation in Low-beta Plasmas
authors: Ka Wai Ho, Alex Lazarian
topic: The strong alignment of small-scale turbulent Alfvenic motions with the direction of the magnetic field that percolates the small-scale eddies and imprints the direction of the magnetic field is a property that follows from the MHD theory and the theory of turbulent reconnection. The Alfvenic eddies mix magnetic fields perpendicular to the direction of the local magnetic field, and this type of motion is used to trace magnetic fields with the velocity gradient technique (VGT). The other type of turbulent motion, fast modes, induces anisotropies orthogonal to Alfvenic eddies and interferes with the tracing of the magnetic field with the VGT. We report a new effect, i.e., in a magnetically dominated low-\beta subsonic medium, fast modes are very intermittent, and in a volume, with a small filling factor the fast modes dominate other turbulent motions. We identify these localized regions as the cause of the occasional change of direction of gradients in our synthetic observations. We show that the new technique of measuring the gradients of gradient amplitudes suppresses the contribution from the fast-mode-dominated regions, improving the magnetic field tracing. In addition, we show that the distortion of the gradient measurements by fast modes is also applicable to the synchrotron intensity gradients, but the effect is reduced compared to the VGT.

title: Magnetohydrodynamic stability of magnetars in the ultrastrong field regime I: The core
authors: Peter B. Rau, Ira Wasserman
topic: We study magnetohydrodynamic stability of neutron star core matter composed of neutrons, protons and leptons threaded by a magnetar-strength magnetic field 1014--1017 G, where quantum electrodynamical effects and Landau quantization of fermions are important. Stability is determined using the Friedman--Schutz formalism for the canonical energy of fluid perturbations, which we calculate for a magnetizable fluid with H≠B. Using this and the Euler--Heisenberg--Fermi--Dirac Lagrangian for a strongly magnetized fluid of Landau-quantized charged fermions, we calculate the local stability criteria for a fluid slab as a stand-in for a segment of a neutron star core, accounting for magnetic and composition gradient buoyancy. The slab is threaded by a field orthogonal to the gravitational field, the Cartesian analogy to a toroidal field. We find that, for sufficiently strong fields B≳1015 G, the magnetized fluid is unstable to a magnetosonic-type instability with growth times of order 10-3 s. The instability is triggered by sharp changes in the second-order field derivative of the Euler--Heisenberg--Fermi--Dirac Lagrangian which occur where additional Landau levels start being populated. These sharp changes are divergent at zero temperature, but are finite for nonzero temperature, so realistic neutron star core temperatures 5x107 [K-T5x108] K are used. We conjecture that this mechanism could promote the formation of magnetic domains as predicted by Blandford and Hernquist (1982) and Suh and Mathews (2010).

title: Accelerating parameter estimation of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence using adaptive frequency resolutions
authors: Soichiro Morisaki
topic: Bayesian parameter estimation of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence (CBC) typically requires more than millions of evaluations of computationally expensive template waveforms. We propose a technique to reduce the cost of waveform generation by exploiting the chirping behavior of CBC signal. Our technique does not require waveforms at all frequencies in the frequency range used in the analysis, and does not suffer from the fixed cost due to the upsampling of waveforms. Our technique speeds up the parameter estimation of typical binary neutron star signal by a factor of (10) for the low-frequency cutoff of 20Hz, and (102) for 5Hz. It does not require any offline preparations or accurate estimates of source parameters provided by detection pipelines.

title: Analytical study of light ray trajectories in Kerr spacetime in the presence of an inhomogeneous anisotropic plasma
authors: Mohsen Fathi, Marco Olivares, J.R. Villanueva
topic: We calculate the exact solutions to the equations of motion that govern the light ray trajectories as they travel in a Kerr black hole's exterior that is considered to be filled with an inhomogeneous and anisotropic plasmic medium. This is approached by characterizing the plasma through conceiving a radial and an angular structure function, which are let to be constant. The description of the motion is carried out by using the Hamilton-Jacobi method, that allows defining two effective potentials, characterizing the evolution of the polar coordinates. The (hyper-)elliptic integrals of motion are then solved analytically, and the evolution of coordinates is expressed in terms of the Mino time. This way, the three-dimensional demonstrations of the light ray trajectories are given respectively.

title: Quasinormal-modes of the Kerr-Newman black hole: GW150914 and fundamental physics implications
authors: Hai-Tian Wang, Shao-Peng Tang, Peng-Cheng Li, Yi-Zhong Fan
topic: We develop an analytical approach, verified by the nice agreement with the numerical relativity simulation results, to calculate the quasinormal mode spectrum of the Kerr-Newman black hole. Then we analyze the gravitational wave data with the ringdown waveform model including both the fundamental mode and the overtone modes, and find that it can efficiently constrain the charge of the source. For GW150914, the charge-to-mass ratio of the remnant black hole is constrained to be 0.38 at 90% credibility. Our waveform model can be widely applied to other GW150914 like events. With the sole ringdown data, it is capable of constraining the electric, magnetic, or other U(1) dark charges carried by black holes, as well as the deviation parameter (α) of the scalar-tensor-vector gravity. Indeed, a constraint of 0.17 is achieved with the ringdown data alone for the first time.

title: Particle acceleration in strong MHD turbulence
authors: Martin Lemoine 
topic: The non-thermal acceleration of particles in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence plays a central role in a wide variety of astrophysical sites. This physics is addressed here in the context of a strong turbulence, composed of coherent structures rather than waves, outside the realm of quasilinear theory. The present description tracks the momentum of the particle along its history through a sequence of (non-inertial) frames in which the electric field vanishes, in the spirit of the original Fermi scenario. It thus connects the sources of energy gain (or loss) to the gradients of the velocity of the magnetic field lines, in particular the acceleration and the shear of their velocity flow projected along the field line direction, as well as their compression in the transverse plane. Momentum diffusion coefficients associated to these different contributions are expressed as a function of the power spectrum of those velocity fluctuations. Importantly, those velocity gradients are subject to intermittency: they are spatially localized and their strengths obey powerlaw distributions, as demonstrated through direct measurements in the incompressible MHD simulation of the Johns Hopkins University database. This intermittency impacts the acceleration process in a significant way, which opens up prospects for a rich phenomenology, in particular non-thermal spectra with extended powerlaw tails. Those findings generally agree with recent kinetic numerical simulations. Extensions to this description and possible avenues of exploration are discussed.

title: Magneto-thermal evolution of neutron stars with coupled Ohmic, Hall and ambipolar effects via accurate finite-volume simulations
authors: Daniele Viganò, Alberto García-García, José A. Pons, Clara Dehman, Vanessa Graber
topic: Simulating the long-term evolution of temperature and magnetic fields in neutron stars is a major effort in astrophysics, having significant impact in several topics. A detailed evolutionary model requires, at the same time, the numerical solution of the heat diffusion equation, the use of appropriate numerical methods to control non-linear terms in the induction equation, and the local calculation of realistic microphysics coefficients. Here we present the latest extension of the magneto-thermal 2D code in which we have coupled the crustal evolution to the core evolution, including ambipolar diffusion. It has also gained in modularity, accuracy, and efficiency. We revise the most suitable numerical methods to accurately simulate magnetar-like magnetic fields, reproducing the Hall-driven magnetic discontinuities. From the point of view of computational performance, most of the load falls on the calculation of microphysics coefficients. To a lesser extent, the thermal evolution part is also computationally expensive because it requires large matrix inversions due to the use of an implicit method. We show two representative case studies: (i) a non-trivial multipolar configuration confined to the crust, displaying long-lived small-scale structures and discontinuities; and (ii) a preliminary study of ambipolar diffusion in normal matter. The latter acts on timescales that are too long to have relevant effects on the timescales of interest but sets the stage for future works where superfluid and superconductivity need to be included.

title: Mixing matters
authors: Douglas Rennehan
topic: All hydrodynamical simulations of turbulent astrophysical phenomena require sub-grid scale models to properly treat energy dissipation and metal mixing. We present the first implementation and application of an anisotropic eddy viscosity and metal mixing model in Lagrangian astrophysical simulations, including a dynamic procedure for the model parameter. We compare these two models directly to the common Smagorinsky and dynamic variant. Using the mesh-free finite mass method as an example, we show that the anisotropic model is best able to reproduce the proper Kolmogorov inertial range scaling in homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. Additionally, we provide a method to calibrate the metal mixing rate that ensures numerical convergence. In our first application to cosmological simulations, we find that all models strongly impact the early evolution of galaxies leading to differences in enrichment and thermodynamic histories. The anisotropic model has the strongest impact, with little difference between the dynamic and the constant-coefficient variant. We also find that the metal distribution functions in the circumgalactic gas are significantly tighter at all redshifts, with the anisotropic model providing the tightest distributions. This is contrary to a recent study that found metal mixing to be relatively unimportant on cosmological scales. In all of our experiments the constant-coefficient Smagorinsky and anisotropic models rivaled their dynamic counterparts, suggesting that the computationally inexpensive constant-coefficient models are viable alternatives in cosmological contexts.

title: Tidal deformability of strange stars and the GW170817 event
authors: Odilon Lourenço, César H. Lenzi, Mariana Dutra, Efrain J. Ferrer, Vivian de la Incera, Laura Paulucci, J. E. Horvath
topic: In this work we consider strange stars formed by quark matter in the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase of color superconductivity. The CFL phase is described by a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with four-fermion vector and diquark interaction channels. The effect of the color superconducting medium on the gluons are incorporated into the model by including the gluon self-energy in the thermodynamic potential. We construct parametrizations of the model by varying the vector coupling GV and comparing the results to the data on tidal deformability from the GW170817 event, the observational data on maximum masses from massive pulsars such as the MSP J0740+6620, and the mass/radius fits to NICER data for PSR J003+0451. Our results points out to windows for the GV parameter space of the model, with and without gluon effects included, that are compatible with all these astrophysical constraints, namely, [0.21\l GV/GS\l 0.4], and [0.02 \l GV/GS \l 0.1], respectively. We also observe a strong correlation between the tidal deformabilites of the GW170817 event and GV. Our results indicate that strange stars cannot be ruled out in collisions of compact binaries from the structural point of view.

title: Poking Holes: Looking for Gaps in LIGO/Virgo's Black Hole Population
authors: Bruce Edelman, Zoheyr Doctor, Ben Farr
topic: Stellar evolution models predict the existence of a gap in the black hole mass spectrum from 55-120Msun due to pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). We investigate the possible existence of such an "upper" mass gap in the second gravitational wave transient catalog (GWTC-2) by hierarchically modeling the astrophysical distribution of black hole masses. We extend the Truncated and Powerlaw+Peak mass distribution families to allow for an explicit gap in the mass distribution, and apply the extended models to GWTC-2. We find that with the Truncated model there is mild evidence favoring an upper mass gap with log Bayes Factor 2.79, inferring the lower and upper bounds at 56.12+7.54-4.38Msun, and 103.74+17.01−6.32Msun respectively. When using the Powerlaw+Peak model, we find no preference for the gap. When imposing tighter priors on the gap bounds centered on the expected PISN gap bounds, the log Bayes factors in favor of a gap mildly increase. These results are however contingent on the parameter inference for the most massive binary, GW190521, for which follow up analyses showed the source may be an intermediate mass ratio merger that has component masses straddling the gap. Using the GW190521 posterior samples from the analysis in Nitz & Capano (2021), we find an increase in Bayes factors in favor of the gap. However, the overall conclusions are unchanged: There is no preference for a gap when using the Powerlaw+Peak model. This work paves the way for constraining the physics of pair-instability and pulsational pair-instability supernovae and high-mass black hole formation.

title: Gyroresonance and free-free radio emissions from multi-thermal multi-component plasma
authors: Gregory D. Fleishman, Alexey A. Kuznetsov, Enrico Landi
topic: Thermal plasma of solar atmosphere includes a wide range of temperatures. This plasma is often quantified, both in observations and models, by a differential emission measure (DEM). DEM is a distribution of the thermal electron density square over temperature. In observations, the DEM is computed along a line of sight, while in the modeling -- over an elementary volume element (voxel). This description of the multi-thermal plasma is convenient and widely used in the analysis and modeling of extreme ultraviolet emission (EUV), which has an optically thin character. However, there is no corresponding treatment in the radio domain, where optical depth of emission can be large, more than one emission mechanism are involved, and plasma effects are important. Here, we extend the theory of the thermal gyroresonance and free-free radio emissions in the classical mono-temperature Maxwellian plasma to the case of a multi-temperature plasma. The free-free component is computed using the DEM and temperature-dependent ionization states of coronal ions, contributions from collisions of electrons with neutral atoms, exact Gaunt factor, and the magnetic field effect. For the gyroresonant component, another measure of the multi-temperature plasma is used which describes the distribution of the thermal electron density over temperature. We give representative examples demonstrating important changes in the emission intensity and polarization due to considered effects. The theory is implemented in available computer code.

title: Supernova Fallback as Origin of Neutron Star Spins and Spin-kick Alignment
authors: H.-Thomas Janka (1), Annop Wongwathanarat (1), Michael Kramer (2,3) 
topic: Natal kicks and spins are characteristic properties of neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). Both offer valuable clues to dynamical processes during stellar core collapse and explosion. Moreover, they influence the evolution of stellar multiple systems and the gravitational-wave signals from their inspiral and merger. Observational evidence of possibly generic spin-kick alignment has been interpreted as indication that NS spins are either induced with the NS kicks or inherited from progenitor rotation, which thus might play a dynamically important role during stellar collapse. Current three-dimensional supernova simulations suggest that NS kicks are transferred in the first seconds of the explosion, mainly by anisotropic mass ejection and, on a secondary level, anisotropic neutrino emission. In contrast, the NS spins are only determined minutes to hours later by angular momentum associated with fallback of matter that does not become gravitationally unbound in the supernova. Here, we propose a novel scenario to explain spin-kick alignment as a consequence of tangential vortex flows in the fallback matter that is accreted mostly from the direction of the NS's motion. For this effect the initial NS kick is crucial, because it produces a growing offset of the NS away from the explosion center, thus promoting onesided accretion. In this new scenario conclusions based on traditional concepts are reversed. For example, pre-kick NS spins are not required, and rapid progenitor-core rotation can hamper spin-kick alignment. We also discuss implications for natal BH kicks and the possibility of tossing the BH's spin axis during its formation.

title: Realistic Finite-Temperature Effects in Neutron Star Merger Simulations
authors: Carolyn Raithel, Vasileios Paschalidis, Feryal Özel
topic: Binary neutron star mergers provide a unique probe of the dense-matter equation of state (EoS) across a wide range of parameter space, from the zero-temperature EoS during the inspiral to the high-temperature EoS following the merger. In this paper, we implement a new model for calculating parametrized finite-temperature EoS effects into numerical relativity simulations. This "M* model" is based on a two-parameter approximation of the particle effective mass and includes the leading-order effects of degeneracy in the thermal pressure and energy. We test our numerical implementation by performing evolutions of rotating single stars with zero- and non-zero temperature gradients, as well as evolutions of binary neutron star mergers. We find that our new finite-temperature EoS implementation can support stable stars over many dynamical timescales. We also perform a first parameter study to explore the role of the M* parameters in binary neutron star merger simulations. All simulations start from identical initial data with identical cold EoSs, and differ only in the thermal part of the EoS. We find that both the thermal profile of the remnant and the post-merger gravitational wave signal depend on the choice of M* parameters, but that the total merger ejecta depends only weakly on the finite-temperature part of the EoS across a wide range of parameters. Our simulations provide a first step toward understanding how the finite-temperature properties of dense matter may affect future observations of binary neutron star mergers.

title: The Jet-Disk Boundary Layer in Black Hole Accretion
authors: George N. Wong, Yufeng Du, Ben S. Prather, Charles F. Gammie
topic: Magnetic fields lines are trapped in black hole event horizons by accreting plasma. If the trapped field lines are lightly loaded with plasma, then their motion is controlled by their footpoints on the horizon and thus by the spin of the black hole. In this paper, we investigate the boundary layer between lightly loaded polar field lines and a dense, equatorial accretion flow. We present an analytic model for aligned prograde and retrograde accretion systems and argue that there is significant shear across this "jet-disk boundary" at most radii for all black hole spins. Specializing to retrograde aligned accretion, where the model predicts the strongest shear, we show numerically that the jet-disk boundary is unstable. The resulting mixing layer episodically loads plasma onto trapped field lines where it is heated, forced to rotate with the hole, and permitted to escape outward into the jet. In one case we follow the mass loading in detail using Lagrangian tracer particles and find a time-averaged mass-loading rate ~ 0.01 Mdot.

title: A New Fast Monte Carlo Code for Solving Radiative Transfer Equations based on Neumann Solution
authors: Xiao-lin Yang, Jian-cheng Wang, Chu-yuan Yang
topic: In this paper, we proposed a new Monte Carlo radiative transport (MCRT) scheme, which is based completely on the Neumann series solution of Fredholm integral equation. This scheme indicates that the essence of MCRT is the calculation of infinite terms of multiple integrals in Neumann solution simultaneously. Under this perspective we redescribed MCRT procedure systematically, in which the main work amounts to choose an associated probability distribution function (PDF) for a set of random variables and the corresponding unbiased estimation functions. We can select a relatively optimal estimation procedure that has a lower variance from an infinite possible choices, such as the term by term estimation. In this scheme, MCRT can be regarded as a pure problem of integral evaluation, rather than as the tracing of random walking photons. Keeping this in mind, one can avert some subtle intuitive mistakes. In addition the Sigma-functions in these integrals can be eliminated in advance by integrating them out directly. This fact together with the optimal chosen random variables can remarkably improve the Monte Carlo (MC) computational efficiency and accuracy, especially in systems with axial or spherical symmetry. An MCRT code, Lemon (Linear Integral Equations' Monte Carlo Solver Based on the Neumann solution), has been developed completely based on this scheme. Finally, we intend to verify the validation of Lemon, a suite of test problems mainly restricted to flat spacetime have been reproduced and the corresponding results are illustrated in detail.

title: Numerical-relativity simulations of the quasi-circular inspiral and merger of non-spinning, charged black holes: methods and comparison with approximate approaches
authors: Gabriele Bozzola, Vasileios Paschalidis
topic: We present fully general relativistic simulations of the quasi-circular inspiral and merger of charged, non-spinning, binary black holes with charge-to-mass ratio lambda \leq 0.3. We discuss the key features that enabled long term and stable evolutions of these binaries. We also present a formalism for computing the angular momentum carried away by electromagnetic waves, and the electromagnetic contribution to black-hole horizon properties. We implement our formalism and present the results for the first time in numerical-relativity simulations. In addition, we compare our full non-linear solutions with existing approximate models for the inspiral and ringdown phases. We show that Newtonian models based on the quadrupole approximation have errors of 20 % - 100 % in key gauge-invariant quantities. On the other hand, for the systems considered, we find that estimates of the remnant black hole spin based on the motion of test particles in Kerr-Newman spacetimes agree with our non-linear calculations to within a few percent. Finally, we discuss the prospects for detecting black hole charge by future gravitational-wave detectors using either the inspiral-merger-ringdown signal or the ringdown signal alone.

title: Constraining the Neutron Star Mass--Radius Relation and Dense Matter Equation of State with NICER. III. Model Description and Verification of Parameter Estimation Codes
authors: Slavko Bogdanov, Alexander J. Dittmann et al
topic: We describe the X-ray pulse profile models we use, and how we use them, to analyze Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars to obtain information about the mass-radius relation of neutron stars and the equation of state of the dense matter in their cores. Here we detail our modeling of the observed profile of PSR J0030+0451 that we analyzed in Miller et al. (2019) and Riley et al. (2019) and describe a cross-verification of computations of the pulse profiles of a star with R/M 3, in case stars this compact need to be considered in future analyses. We also present our early cross-verification efforts of the parameter estimation procedures used by Miller et al. (2019) and Riley et al. (2019) by analyzing two distinct synthetic data sets. Both codes yielded credible regions in the mass-radius plane that are statistically consistent with one another and both gave posterior distributions for model parameter values consistent with the values that were used to generate the data. We also summarize the additional tests of the parameter estimation procedure of Miller et al. (2019) that used synthetic pulse profiles and the NICER pulse profile of PSR J0030+0451. We then illustrate how the precision of mass and radius estimates depends on the pulsar's spin rate and the size of its hot spot by analyzing four different synthetic pulse profiles. Finally, we assess possible sources of systematic error in these estimates made using this technique, some of which may warrant further investigation.

title: X-ray emission from magnetized neutron star atmospheres at low mass accretion rates. I. Phase-averaged spectrum
authors: E. Sokolova-Lapa, M. Gornostaev et al
topic: Recent observations of X-ray pulsars at low luminosities allow, for the first time, to compare theoretical models for the emission from highly magnetized neutron star atmospheres at low mass accretion rates (M \leq 10 to 15 g s−1) with the broadband X-ray data. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the spectral formation in the neutron star atmosphere at low Mdot and to conduct a parameter study of physical properties of the emitting region. We obtain the structure of the static atmosphere, assuming that Coulomb collisions are the dominant deceleration process. The upper part of the atmosphere is strongly heated by the braking plasma, reaching temperatures of 30-40 keV, while its denser isothermal interior is much cooler (2 keV). We numerically solve the polarized radiative transfer in the atmosphere with magnetic Compton scattering, free-free processes, and non-thermal cyclotron emission due to possible collisional excitations of electrons. The strongly polarized emitted spectrum has a double-hump shape that is observed in low-luminosity X-ray pulsars. A low-energy "thermal" component is dominated by extraordinary photons that can leave the atmosphere from deeper layers due to their long mean free path at soft energies. We find that a high-energy component is formed due to resonant Comptonization in the heated non-isothermal part of the atmosphere even in the absence of collisional excitations. The latter, however, affect the ratio of the two components. A strong cyclotron line originates from the optically thin, uppermost zone. A fit of the model to NuSTAR and Swift/XRT observations of GX 304-1 provides an accurate description of the data with reasonable parameters. The model can thus reproduce the characteristic double-hump spectrum observed in low-luminosity X-ray pulsars and provides insights into spectral formation.

title: Detecting and reconstructing gravitational waves from the next Galactic core-collapse supernova in the Advanced Detector Era
authors: Marek Szczepanczyk, Javier Antelis et al
topic: We performed a detailed analysis of the detectability of a wide range of gravitational waves derived from core-collapse supernova simulations using gravitational-wave detector noise scaled to the sensitivity of the upcoming fourth and fifth observing runs of the Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA. We use the coherent WaveBurst algorithm, which was used in the previous observing runs to search for gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae. As coherent WaveBurst makes minimal assumptions on the morphology of a gravitational-wave signal, it can play an important role in the first detection of gravitational waves from an event in the Milky Way. We predict that signals from neutrino-driven explosions could be detected up to an average distance of 10 kpc, and distances of over 100 kpc can be reached for explosions of rapidly rotating progenitor stars. An estimated minimum signal-to-noise ratio of 10-25 is needed for the signals to be detected. We quantify the accuracy of the waveforms reconstructed with coherent WaveBurst and we determine that the most challenging signals to reconstruct are those produced in long-duration neutrino-driven explosions and models that form black holes a few seconds after the core bounce.

title: A Mechanical Model for Magnetized Relativistic Blastwaves
authors: Shunke Ai, Bing Zhang
topic: The evolution of a relativistic blastwave is usually delineated under the assumption of pressure balance between forward- and reverse-shocked regions. However, such a treatment usually violates the energy conservation law. A mechanical model of non-magnetized blastwaves was proposed in previous works to solve the problem. In this paper, we generalize the mechanical model to the case of a blastwave driven by an ejecta with an arbitrary magnetization parameter Sigma ej. We test our modified mechanical model by considering a long-lasting magnetized ejecta and found that it is much better in terms of energy conservation than the pressure-balance treatment. For a constant luminosity Lej=1047erg s−1 and [Sigma ej<10], the deviation from energy conservation is negligibly small at small radii, but only reaches less than 25% even at 10 to 19cm from the central engine. Assuming a finite lifetime of the central engine, the reverse shock crosses the magnetized ejecta earlier for the ejecta wiith a higher Sigma ej. After shock crossing, all the ejecta energy is injected into the blastwave.

title: Ultra-compact binary pulsars as continuous dual-line gravitational wave sources
authors: Wen-Cong Chen
topic: Binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are detached binary systems consisting of a MSP and a He white dwarf. If the initial orbital periods of binary MSPs are less than 0.3 day, they would evolve toward ultra-compact binary pulsars due to the rapid orbital shrinkage by the gravitational wave (GW) radiation. During the orbital decay, the MSP with an ellipticity would spin down by the GW radiation and the magnetic dipole radiation. Our calculations indicate that the angular momentum loss is dominated by the GW radiation when the ellipticities of the neutron stars (NSs) are in the range of (1−50)x10-7, and the frequencies of high-frequency GW signals from the rotating NSs are 10-100 Hz when the binary pulsars can be visible as low-frequency GW sources. These high-frequency GW signals are possible to be detected by the aLIGO and the third-generation GW detectors such as Einstein Telescope, depending on the frequencies and the distances. Therefore, some ultra-compact binary pulsars have an opportunity to become intriguing dual-line GW sources. By detecting the low-frequency GW signals, the NS mass can be accurately derived. A dual-line detection of two band GW signals could provide a constraint on the moment of inertia and the ellipticity of the NS. Thus the dual-line GW sources can be potentially applied to constrain the equation of state of the NS.

title: kuibit: Analyzing Einstein Toolkit simulations with Python
authors: Gabriele Bozzola
topic: In the era of gravitational-wave astronomy, general-relativistic simulations of compact objects play a role of paramount importance. These calculations can be performed with the Einstein Toolkit, an open-source and community-supported software for numerical-relativity and relativistic astrophysics. The code comes with multiple solvers for Einstein's equations and for the equations of general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics, along with a series of useful diagnostics. However, analyzing the output of the Einstein Toolkit can be a challenging task. Usually, the process involves a series of technical obstacles, like combining data from different restarts or working with HDF5 files. Here, we present kuibit, a Python library that takes care of all these low-level details (and many other more) and that provides high-level, intuitive, representations of the data. Kuibit ships with a wide range of features that include full support for 1-3D ASCII and HDF5 grid data, time and frequency series, gravitational waves, and apparent horizons. With kuibit, users can inspect most of the content of a simulation with just a few lines of code. Importantly, kuibit is designed to be a code for the community: it is user-friendly and does not require any proprietary software to run, it has documentation and examples, and it is openly developed with emphasis on extensibility and maintainability.

title: Fast-transient Searches in Real Time with ZTFReST: Identification of Three Optically-discovered Gamma-ray Burst Afterglows and New Constraints on the Kilonova Rate
authors: Igor Andreoni, Michael W. Coughlin, ...  Tim Dietrich ... et al
topic: While optical surveys regularly discover slow transients like supernovae on their own, the most common way to discover extragalactic fast transients, fading away in a few nights, is via follow-up observations of gamma-ray burst and gravitational-wave triggers. However, wide-field surveys have the potential to also identify rapidly fading transients independently of such external triggers. The volumetric survey speed of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) makes it sensitive to faint and fast-fading objects as kilonovae, the optical counterparts to binary neutron stars and neutron star-black hole mergers, out to almost 200Mpc. We introduce an open-source software infrastructure, the ZTF REaltime Search and Triggering, ZTFReST, designed to identify kilonovae and fast optical transients in ZTF data. Using the ZTF alert stream combined with forced photometry, we have implemented automated candidate ranking based on their photometric evolution and fitting to kilonova models. Automated triggering of follow-up systems, such as Las Cumbres Observatory, has also been implemented. In 13 months of science validation, we found several extragalactic fast transients independent of any external trigger (though some counterparts were identified later), including at least one supernova with post-shock cooling emission, two known afterglows with an associated gamma-ray burst, two known afterglows without any known gamma-ray counterpart, and three new fast-declining sources (ZTF20abtxwfx, ZTF20acozryr, and ZTF21aagwbjr) that are likely associated with GRB200817A, GRB201103B, and GRB210204A. However, we have not found any objects which appear to be kilonovae; therefore, we constrain the rate of GW170817-like kilonovae to R 900Gpc-3yr-1. A framework such as ZTFReST could become a prime tool for kilonova and fast transient discovery with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

title: A unified model of tidal destruction events in the disc-dominated phase
authors: Andrew Mummery
topic: We develop a unification scheme which explains the varied observed properties of TDEs in terms of simple disc physics. The unification scheme postulates that the different observed properties of TDEs are controlled by the peak Eddington ratio of the accretion discs which form following a stellar disruption. Our primary result is that the TDE population can be split into four subpopulations, which are (in order of decreasing peak Eddington ratio): "obscured" UV-bright and X-ray dim TDEs; X-ray bright soft-state TDEs; UV-bright and X-ray dim "cool" TDEs; and X-ray bright hard-state TDEs. These 4 subpopulations of TDEs will occur around black holes of well defined masses, and our unification scheme is therefore directly testable with observations. As an initial test, we model the X-ray and UV light curves of six TDEs taken from three of the four subpopulations: ASASSN-14ae, ASASSN-15oi, ASASSN-18pg, AT2019dsg, XMMSL1 J0740 & XMMSL2 J1446. We show that all six TDEs, spanning a wide range of observed properties, are well modelled by evolving relativistic thin discs. The peak Eddington ratio's of the six best-fitting disc solutions lie exactly as predicted by the unified model. The mean stellar mass of the six sources is ⟨Mstar⟩ 0.24Msun. The so-called missing energy problem is resolved by demonstrating that only 1% of the radiated accretion disc energy is observed at X-ray and UV frequencies. Finally, we present an empirical, approximately linear, relationship between the total radiated energy of the accretion disc and the total radiated energy of an early-time, rapidly-decaying, UV component, seen in all TDEs.

title: Super-Eddington Emission from Accreting, Highly Magnetised Neutron Stars with a Multipolar Magnetic Field
authors: Nabil Brice, Silvia Zane, Roberto Turolla, Kinwah Wu
topic: Pulsating ultra-luminous X-ray sources (PULXs) are characterised by an extremely large luminosity (>1040erg s−1). While there is a general consensus that they host an accreting, magnetized neutron star (NS), the problem of how to produce luminosities >100 times the Eddington limit, LE, of a solar mass object is still debated. A promising explanation relies on the reduction of the opacities in the presence of a strong magnetic field, which allows for the local flux to be much larger than the Eddington flux. However, avoiding the onset of the propeller effect may be a serious problem. Here, we reconsider the problem of column accretion onto a highly magnetized NS, extending previously published calculations by relaxing the assumption of a pure dipolar field and allowing for more complex magnetic field topologies. We find that the maximum luminosity is determined primarily by the magnetic field strength near the NS surface. We also investigate other factors determining the accretion column geometry and the emergent luminosity, such as the assumptions on the parameters governing the accretion flow at the disk-magnetosphere boundary. We conclude that a strongly magnetized NS with a dipole component of ~1013G, octupole component of ~1014G and spin period ~1s can produce a luminosity of ~1041erg s−1 while avoiding the propeller regime. We apply our model to two PULXs, NGC 5907 ULX-1 and NGC 7793 P13, and discuss how their luminosity and spin period rate can be explained in terms of different configurations, either with or without multipolar magnetic components.

title: Fallback Accretion Halted by R-process Heating in Neutron Star Mergers and Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Wataru Ishizaki, Kenta Kiuchi, Kunihito Ioka, Shinya Wanajo
topic: The gravitational wave event GW170817 with a macronova/kilonova shows that a merger of two neutron stars ejects matter with radioactivity including r-process nucleosynthesis. A part of the ejecta inevitably falls back to the central object, possibly powering long-lasting activities of a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB), such as extended and plateau emissions. We investigate the fallback accretion with the r-process heating by performing one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and developing a semi-analytical model. We show that the usual fallback rate dM/dt prop to t -5/3 is halted by the heating because pressure gradients accelerate ejecta beyond an escape velocity. The suppression is steeper than Chevalier's power-law model through Bondi accretion within a turn-around radius. The characteristic halting timescale is  105--109 sec for the GW170817-like r-process heating, which is long enough to continue the long-lasting emission of sGRBs. The halting timescale is sensitive to the uncertainty of the r-process. Future observation of fallback halting could constrain the r-process heating on the year scale.

title: Fallback Accretion Model for the Years-to-Decades X-ray Counterpart to GW170817
authors: Wataru Ishizaki, Kunihito Ioka, Kenta Kiuchi
topic: A new component was reported in the X-ray counterpart to the binary neutron-star merger and gravitational wave event GW170817, exceeding the afterglow emission from an off-axis structured jet. The afterglow emission from the kilonova/macronova ejecta may explain the X-ray excess but exceeds the radio observations if the spectrum is the same. We propose a fallback accretion model that a part of ejecta from the neutron star merger falls back and forms a disk around the central compact object. In the super-Eddington accretion phase, the X-ray luminosity stays near the Eddington limit of a few solar masses and the radio is weak, as observed. This will be followed by a power law decay with index −5/3. The duration of the constant luminosity phase conveys the initial fallback timescale t0 in the past. The current multi-year duration requires t0>3--30 sec, suggesting that the disk wind rather than the dynamical ejecta falls back after the jet launch. Future observations in the next decades will probe the timescale of t0∼10--104 sec, around the time of extended emission in short gamma-ray bursts. The fallback accretion has not been halted by the {\it r}-process heating, implying that fission is weak on the year scale. We predict that the X-ray counterpart will disappear in a few decades due to the {\it r}-process halting.

title: A search for radio emission from double-neutron star merger GW190425 using Apertif
authors: Olivér Boersma, Joeri van Leeuwen, Elizabeth A. K. Adams et al
topic: Detection of the electromagnetic emission from coalescing binary neutron stars (BNS) is important for understanding the merger and afterglow. We present a search for a radio counterpart to the gravitational-wave source GW190425, a BNS merger, using Apertif on the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). We observe a field of high probability in the associated localisation region for 3 epochs at 68, 90 and 109 days post merger. We identify all sources that exhibit flux variations consistent with the expected afterglow emission of GW190425. We also look for possible transients. These are sources which are only present in one epoch. In addition, we quantify our ability to search for radio afterglows in fourth and future observing runs of the gravitational-wave detector network using Monte Carlo simulations. We found 25 afterglow candidates based on their variability. None of these could be associated with a possible host galaxy at the luminosity distance of GW190425. We also found 55 transient afterglow candidates that were only detected in one epoch. All turned out to be image artefacts. In the fourth observing run, we predict that up to three afterglows will be detectable by Apertif. While we did not find a source related to the afterglow emission of GW190425, the search validates our methods for future searches of radio afterglows.

title: Constraints on ultra-low-frequency gravitational waves from an eccentric supermassive black hole binary
authors: Tomonosuke Kikunaga, Tomonosuke Kikunaga, Hiroki Kumamoto, Keitaro Takahashi
topic: Milli-second pulsars with highly stable periods can be considered as very precise clocks and can be used for pulsar timing array (PTA) which attempts to detect nanoheltz gravitational waves (GWs) directly. Main sources of nanoheltz GWs are supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries which have sub-pc-scale orbits. On the other hand, a SMBH binary which is in an earlier phase and has pc-scale orbit emits ultra-low-frequency ([\l 10−9Hz]) GWs cannot be detected with the conventional methodology of PTA. Such binaries tend to obtain high eccentricity, possibly  0.9. In this paper, we develop a formalism for extending constraints on GW amplitudes from single sources obtained by PTA toward ultra-low frequencies considering the waveform expected from an eccentric SMBH binary. GWs from an eccentric binaries are contributed from higher harmonics and, therefore, have a different waveform those from a circular binary. Furthermore, we apply our formalism to several hypothetical SMBH binaries at the center of nearby galaxies, including M87, using the constraints from NANOGrav's 11-year data set. For a hypothetical SMBH binary at the center of M87, the typical upper limit on the mass ratio is 0.16 for eccentricity of 0.9 and semi-major axis of a=1 pc, assuming the binary phase to be the pericenter.

title: Transients from ONe White-Dwarf - Neutron-Star/Black-Hole Mergers
authors: Alexey Bobrick, Yossef Zenati, Hagai B. Perets, Melvyn B. Davies, Ross Church
topic: We conduct the first 3D hydrodynamic simulations of oxygen-neon white-dwarf-neutron star/black hole mergers (ONe WD-NS/BH mergers). Such mergers constitute a significant fraction, and may even dominate, the inspiral rates of all WD-NS binaries. We post-process our simulations to obtain the nuclear evolution of these systems and couple the results to a supernova spectral synthesis code to obtain the first light curves and spectra for these transients. We find that the amount of 56Ni synthesised in these mergers grows as a strong function of the WD mass, reaching typically 0.05 and up to 0.1Msun per merger. Photodisintegration leads to similar amounts of 4He and about a ten times smaller amount of 1H. The nuclear yields from these mergers, in particular those of 55Mn, may contribute significantly to Galactic chemical evolution. The transients expected from ONe WD-NS mergers are dominantly red/infrared, evolve on month-long timescales and reach bolometric magnitudes of up to -16.5. The current surveys must have already detected these transients or are, alternatively, putting strong constraints on merger scenarios. The properties of the expected transients from WD-NS mergers best agree with faint type Iax supernovae. The Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST) will be detecting up to hundreds of merging ONe WD-NS systems per year. We simulate a subset of our models with 2D axisymmetric FLASH code to investigate why they have been challenging for previous studies. We find that the likely main challenge has been effectively modelling the nuclear statistical equilibrium regime in such mergers.

title: Tidal-heating/viscous dissipation correspondence in black holes and viscous compact objects
authors: Yotam Sherf
topic: The effect of energy absorption during the binary evolution of Exotic-compact-objects (ECOs) is extensively studied. We review the underlying mechanism that provides the energy dissipation in material objects - tidal friction. We show that unlike typical astrophysical objects, where absorption due to viscosity is negligible, in ECOs, absorption could potentially mimic the analogous effect of black-holes (BHs) - tidal heating. We stand for their differences and similarities in the context of energy dissipation during the inspiral. Inspired by the membrane paradigm and recent studies, we demonstrate how viscosity is a defining feature that quantifies how close is the ECO absorption to that of a classical BH absorption. We show that for ECOs, viscosity can induce significant modifications to the GW waveform, which in some favorable scenarios of super-massive binaries of equal mass and spin, enables the measurement of the ECO absorption in the future precision gravitational-wave (GW) observations. Finally, we discuss the implications on the ECO reflection coefficient and the relation to the universal viscosity to volume entropy bound.

title: Generalized Approach to Matched Filtering using Neural Networks
authors: Jingkai Yan, Mariam Avagyan, Robert E. Colgan, Doğa Veske, Imre Bartos, John Wright, Zsuzsa Márka, Szabolcs Márka
topic: Gravitational wave science is a pioneering field with rapidly evolving data analysis methodology currently assimilating and inventing deep learning techniques. The bulk of the sophisticated flagship searches of the field rely on the time-tested matched filtering principle within their core. In this paper, we make a key observation on the relationship between the emerging deep learning and the traditional techniques: matched filtering is formally equivalent to a particular neural network. This means that a neural network can be constructed analytically to exactly implement matched filtering, and can be further trained on data or boosted with additional complexity for improved performance. This fundamental equivalence allows us to define a "complexity standard candle" allowing us to characterize the relative complexity of the different approaches to gravitational wave signals in a common framework. Additionally it also provides a glimpse of an intriguing symmetry that could provide clues on how neural networks approach the problem of finding signals in overwhelming noise. Moreover, we show that the proposed neural network architecture can outperform matched filtering, both with or without knowledge of a prior on the parameter distribution. When a prior is given, the proposed neural network can approach the statistically optimal performance. We also propose and investigate two different neural network architectures MNet-Shallow and MNet-Deep, both of which implement matched filtering at initialization and can be trained on data. MNet-Shallow has simpler structure, while MNet-Deep is more flexible and can deal with a wider range of distributions. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by experiments using real LIGO data and synthetic injections. Finally, our results suggest new perspectives on the role of deep learning in gravitational wave detection.

title: Unbiased likelihood-free inference of the Hubble constant from light standard sirens
authors: Francesca Gerardi, Stephen M. Feeney, Justin Alsing
topic: Multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers offer a promising path towards resolution of the Hubble constant (H0) tension, provided their constraints are shown to be free from systematics such as the Malmquist bias. In the traditional Bayesian framework, accounting for selection effects in the likelihood requires calculation of the expected number (or fraction) of detections as a function of the parameters describing the population and cosmology; a potentially costly and/or inaccurate process. This calculation can, however, be bypassed completely by performing the inference in a framework in which the likelihood is never explicitly calculated, but instead fit using forward simulations of the data, which naturally include the selection. This is Likelihood-Free Inference (LFI). Here, we use density-estimation LFI, coupled to neural-network-based data compression, to infer H0 from mock catalogues of binary neutron star mergers, given noisy redshift, distance and peculiar velocity estimates for each object. We demonstrate that LFI yields statistically unbiased estimates of H0 in the presence of selection effects, with precision matching that of sampling the full Bayesian hierarchical model. Marginalizing over the bias increases the H0 uncertainty by only 6% for training sets consisting of O(104) populations. The resulting LFI framework is applicable to population-level inference problems with selection effects across astrophysics.

Using Bayesian techniques, we establish that our mass function fits a new catalog of black hole masses approximately as well as the pre-existing phenomenological mass functions. We also remark on the implications of these results for constraining or discovering new phenomena in nuclear and particle physics.

topic: We analyze the LIGO/Virgo GWTC-2 catalog to study the primary mass distribution of the merging black holes. We perform hierarchical Bayesian analysis, and examine whether the mass distribution has a sharp cutoff for primary black hole masses below 65Msun, as predicted in pulsational pair instability supernova model. We construct two empirical mass functions. One is a piece-wise function with two power-law segments jointed by a sudden drop. The other consists of a main truncated power-law component, a Gaussian component, and a third very massive component. Both models can reasonably fit the data and a sharp drop of the mass distribution is found at ~50Msun, suggesting that the majority of the observed black holes can be explained by the stellar evolution scenarios in which the pulsational pair-instability process takes place. On the other hand, the very massive sub-population, which accounts for at most several percents of the total, may be formed through hierarchical mergers or other processes.

title: Magnetohydrodynamic convection in accretion discs
authors: Loren E. Held, Henrik N. Latter
topic: Convection has been discussed in the field of accretion discs for several decades, both as a means of angular momentum transport and also because of its role in controlling discs' vertical structure via heat transport. If the gas is sufficiently ionized and threaded by a weak magnetic field, convection might interact in non-trivial ways with the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Recently, vertically stratified local simulations of the MRI have reported considerable variation in the angular momentum transport, as measured by the stress to thermal pressure ratio alpha, when convection is thought to be present. Although MRI turbulence can act as a heat source for convection, it is not clear how the instabilities will interact dynamically. Here we aim to investigate the interplay between the two instabilities in controlled numerical experiments, and thus isolate the generic features of their interaction. We perform vertically stratified, 3D MHD shearing box simulations with a perfect gas equation of state with the conservative, finite-volume code PLUTO. We find two characteristic outcomes of the interaction between the two instabilities: straight MRI and MRI/convective cycles, with the latter exhibiting alternating phases of convection-dominated flow (during which the turbulent transport is weak) and MRI-dominated flow. During the latter phase we find that alpha is enhanced by nearly an order of magnitude, reaching peak values of ~0.08. In addition, we find that convection in the non-linear phase takes the form of large-scale and oscillatory convective cells. Convection can also help the MRI persist to lower Rm than it would otherwise do. Finally we discuss how our results help interpret simulations of Dwarf Novae.

title: Probing supermassive stars and massive black hole seeds through gravitational wave inspirals
authors: Yael Raveh, Yonadav Barry Ginat, Hagai B. Perets, Tyrone E. Woods
topic: We propose a novel source of gravitational wave emission: the inspirals of compact fragments inside primordial supermassive stars (SMSs). Such systems are thought to be an essential channel in the as-yet little understood formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). One model suggests that high accretion rates of 0.1-1 Msun/yr attainable in atomically-cooled primordial halos can lead to the formation of a nuclear-burning SMS. This will ultimately undergo collapse through a relativistic instability, leaving a massive BH remnant. Recent simulations suggest that supermassive stars rarely form in isolation, and that companion stars and even black holes formed may be captured/accreted and inspiral to the SMS core due to gas dynamical friction. Here, we explore the GW emission produced from such inspirals, which could probe the formation and evolution of SMS and seeds of the first supermassive black holes. We use a semi-analytic gas-dynamical friction model of the inspirals in the SMS to characterize their properties. We find such sources could potentially be observable by upcoming space-born GW-detectors at their formation redshifts with the benefit of gravitational lensing. Mergers within closely-related quasi-stars may produce a much stronger signal, though disambiguating such events from other high-z events may prove challenging.

title: Black Holes merging with Low Mass Gap Objects inside Globular Clusters
authors: Konstantinos Kritos, Ilias Cholis
topic: Recently, the LIGO-Virgo collaborations have reported the coalescence of a binary involving a black hole and a low-mass gap object (LMGO) with mass in the range ~2.5−5Msun. Such detections, challenge our understanding of the black hole and neutron star mass spectrum, as well as how such binaries evolve especially if isolated. In this work we study the dynamical formation of compact object pairs, via multiple binary-single exchanges that occur at the cores of globular clusters. We start with a population of binary star systems, which interact with single compact objects as first generation black holes and LMGOs. We evaluate the rate of exchange interactions leading to the formation of compact object binaries. Our calculations include all possible types of binary-single exchange interactions and also the interactions of individual stars with compact object binaries that can evolve their orbital properties, leading to their eventual merger. We perform our calculations for the full range of the observed Milky Way globular cluster environments. We find that the exchanges are efficient in forming hard compact object binaries at the cores of dense astrophysical stellar environments. Furthermore, if the population size of the LMGOs is related to that of neutron stars, the inferred merger rate density of black hole-LMGO binaries inside globular clusters in the local Universe is estimated to be about 0.1Gpc-3yr−1.

title: The emergence of a new source of X-rays from the binary neutron star merger GW170817
authors: A. Hajela, R. Margutti, J. S. Bright, K. D. Alexander, B. D. Metzger, V. Nedora et al
topic: The binary neutron-star (BNS) merger GW170817 is the first celestial object from which both gravitational waves (GWs) and light have been detected enabling critical insight on the pre-merger (GWs) and post-merger (light) physical properties of these phenomena. For the first ~3 years after the merger the detected radio and X-ray radiation has been dominated by emission from a structured relativistic jet initially pointing ~15−25 degrees away from our line of sight and propagating into a low-density medium. Here we report on observational evidence for the emergence of a new X-ray emission component at delta t>900 days after the merger. The new component has luminosity Lx=5x1038ergs-1 at 1234 days, and represents a ~3.5σ - 4.3σ excess compared to the expectations from the off-axis jet model that best fits the multi-wavelength afterglow of GW170817 at earlier times. A lack of detectable radio emission at 3 GHz around the same time suggests a harder broadband spectrum than the jet afterglow. These properties are consistent with synchrotron emission from a mildly relativistic shock generated by the expanding merger ejecta, i.e. a kilonova afterglow. In this context our simulations show that the X-ray excess supports the presence of a high-velocity tail in the merger ejecta, and argues against the prompt collapse of the merger remnant into a black hole. However, radiation from accretion processes on the compact-object remnant represents a viable alternative to the kilonova afterglow. Neither a kilonova afterglow nor accretion-powered emission have been observed before.

title: Fast radio bursts and their high-energy counterpart from magnetar magnetospheres
authors: Yuan-Pei Yang, Bing Zhang
topic: The recent discovery of a Galactic fast radio burst (FRB) occurring simultaneously with an X-ray burst (XRB) from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 implies that at least some FRBs arise from magnetar activities. We propose that FRBs are triggered by crust fracturing of magnetars, with the burst event rate depending on the magnetic field strength in the crust. Crust fracturing produces Alfvén waves, forming a charge starved region in the magnetosphere and leading to non-stationary pair plasma discharges. An FRB is produced by coherent plasma emission due to nonuniform pair production across magnetic field lines. Meanwhile, the FRB-associated XRB is produced by the rapid relaxation of the external magnetic field lines. In this picture, the sharp-peak hard X-ray component in association with FRB 200428 is from a region between adjacent trapped fireballs, and its spectrum with a high cutoff energy is attributed to resonant Compton scattering. The persistent X-ray emission is from a hot spot heated by the magnetospheric activities, and its temperature evolution is dominated by magnetar surface cooling. Within this picture, magnetars with stronger fields tend to produce brighter and more frequent repeated bursts.

title: Survival times of supramassive neutron stars resulting from binary neutron star mergers
authors: Paz Beniamini, Wenbin Lu
topic: A binary neutron star (BNS) merger can lead to various outcomes, from indefinitely stable neutron stars, through supramassive (SMNS) or hypermassive (HMNS) neutron stars supported only temporarily against gravity, to black holes formed promptly after the merger. Up-to-date constraints on the BNS total mass and the neutron star equation of state suggest that a long-lived SMNS may form in ~0.45−0.9 of BNS mergers. We find that a SMNS typically needs to lose ~3−6×1052 erg of it's rotational energy before it collapses, on a fraction of the spin-down timescale. A SMNS formation imprints on the electromagnetic counterparts to the BNS merger. However, a comparison with observations reveals tensions. First, the distribution of collapse times is too wide and that of released energies too narrow (and the energy itself too large) to explain the observed distributions of internal X-ray plateaus, invoked as evidence for SMNS-powered energy injection. Secondly, the immense energy injection into the blastwave should lead to extremely bright radio transients which previous studies found to be inconsistent with deep radio observations of short gamma-ray bursts. Furthermore, we show that upcoming all-sky radio surveys will enable to constrain the distribution of extracted energies, independently of a GRB jet formation. Our results can be self-consistently understood, provided that BNS merger remnants collapse shortly after their formation (even if their masses are low enough to allow for SMNS formation). We briefly outline how this collapse may be achieved. Future simulations will be needed to test this hypothesis.

title: Equation of State table with hyperon and antikaon for supernova and neutron star merger
authors: Tuhin Malik, Sarmistha Banik, Debades Bandyopadhyay
topic: We develop a new equation of state (EoS) table involving thermal (anti)kaons, Bose-Einstein condensate of K- mesons and Lambda-hyperons for core-collapse supernova and neutron star merger simulations. This EoS table is based on a finite temperature density-dependent relativistic hadron field theory where baryon-baryon interaction is mediated by scalar Sigma, vector Omega and Rhi mesons, using the parameter set DD2 for nucleons. The repulsive hyperon-hyperon interaction is mediated by an additional strange Phi meson. The EoS for the K- condensed matter is also calculated within the framework of relativistic mean field model, whereas the low-density, inhomogeneous matter is calculated in the extended Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium model (NSE). The EoS table is generated for a wide range of values of three parameters - baryon density (10-12 to ~ 1 fm−3), positive charge fraction(0.01 to 0.60) and temperature(0.1 to 158.48 MeV).

title: Modeling the Galactic Neutron Star Population for Use in Continuous Gravitational Wave Searches
authors: Brendan T. Reed, Alex Deibel, C. J. Horowitz
topic: Searches for continuous gravitational waves from unknown Galactic neutron stars provide limits on the shapes of neutron stars. A rotating neutron star will produce gravitational waves if asymmetric deformations exist in its structure that are characterized by the star's ellipticity. In this study, we use a simple model of the spatial and spin distribution of Galactic neutron stars to estimate the total number of neutron stars probed, using gravitational waves, to a given upper limit on the ellipticity. This may help optimize future searches with improved sensitivity. The improved sensitivity of third-generation gravitational wave detectors may increase the number of neutron stars probed, to a given ellipticity, by factors of 100 to 1000.

title: Accretion induced black hole spin up revised by numerical GR MHD simulations
authors: Dominika Ł. Król, Agnieszka Janiuk
topic: We investigate the accretion induced spin up of the black hole via numerical simulations. Our method is based on general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics of the slowly-rotating flows in the Kerr metric, where possibly transonic shock fronts may form. We account for the changing black hole mass and spin during accretion which enforces dynamical evolution of the space-time metric. We first study non-magnetized flows with shocks, and we also include magnetic field endowed in the gas. The aim of this study is to verify whether the high mass black holes may be produced with large spins, even though at birth the collapsars might have contained slowly, or moderately spinning cores. In this way, we put constraints on the content of angular momentum in the collapsing massive stars. Our studies are also showing that shock fronts and magnetic fields may halt accretion and limit the black hole spin-up in the exploding supernovae.

topic: Considering the finite IR behavior of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) running coupling constant in some experiments, we intend to investigate different models presenting running coupling with finite values in the IR region. Using analytic and background perturbation theories, we obtain some equation of states (EoSs) of strange quark matter which satisfy necessary conditions of suitable EoSs. Then we evaluate the properties of strange quark stars in general relativity. Our results for maximum gravitational mass is comparable with the recent LIGO data for the compact binary merger, GW190425.

title: An energy-conserving dynamical model of GRB afterglows from magnetized forward and reverse shocks
authors: Qiang Chen, Xue-Wen Liu
topic: In the dynamical models of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, the uniform assumption of the shocked region is known as provoking total energy conservation problem. In this work we consider shocks originating from magnetized ejecta, extend the energy-conserving hydrodynamical model of Yan et al. (2007) to the MHD limit by applying the magnetized jump conditions from Zhang & Kobayashi (2005). Compared with the non-conservative models, our Lorentz factor of the whole shocked region is larger by a factor (less 1.3). The total pressure of the forward shocked region is higher than the reversed shocked region, in the relativistic regime with a factor of about 3 in our interstellar medium (ISM) cases while ejecta magnetization degree [sigm < 1], and a factor of about 2.4 in the wind cases. For [sig < 1], the non-conservative model loses 32-42% of its total energy for ISM cases, and for wind cases 25-38%, which happens specifically in the forward shocked region, making the shock synchrotron emission from the forward shock less luminous than expected. Once the energy conservation problem is fixed, the late time light curves from the forward shock become nearly independent of the ejecta magnetization. The reverse shocked region doesn't suffer from the energy conservation problem since the changes of the Lorentz factor are recompensed by the changes of the shocked particle number density. The early light curves from the reverse shock are sensitive to the magnetization of the ejecta, thus are an important probe of the magnetization degree.

title: Multimessenger signal from phase transition of neutron star to quark star
authors: Debojoti Kuzur, Ritam Mallick, Prasad R, Shailendra Singh
topic: Aim: To study the multimessenger nature of the signal that can result from the phase transition of a neutron star to a quark star and their corresponding astrophysical observations. Methods: The phase transition process is initiated by the abrupt pressure and density changes at the star center, giving rise to a shock which deconfines matter followed by a weak front converting excess down to strange quarks to attain absolute stability. This process's effects are investigated by understanding how the energy escapes from the star in the form of neutrino-antineutrino annihilation. For such annihilation process, the corresponding energy deposition rate is calculated. Structural changes due to the energy loss have been investigated in the likes of misalignment angle evolution of the star and its astrophysical observation through gravitational waves. Results: The energy and time signature for the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation is compared with the observed isotropic energy for a short gamma-ray burst. The misalignment angle evolves to align the star's tilt axis, which can lead to the sudden increase or decrease of radio intensity from the pulsar. The corresponding gravitational wave emission, both continuous and burst, all lead towards multimessenger signals coming from the phase transition.

title: Measuring Masses and Radii of Neutron Stars in Low-Mass X-ray Binaries: Effects of Atmospheric Composition and Touchdown Radius
authors: Myungkuk Kim, Young-Min Kim, Kwang Hyun Sung, Chang-Hwan Lee, Kyujin Kwak
topic: Methods. We use both a Monte Carlo (MC) sampling and a Bayesian analysis to find the effects of the photospheric composition and the touchdown radius. We apply these two methods to six LMXBs that show PRE XRBs. In both methods, we solve the Eddington flux equation and the apparent angular area equation both of which include the correction terms. For the MC sampling, we have developed an iterative method in order to solve these two equations more efficiently. Results. We confirm that the effects of the photospheric composition and the touchdown radius are similar in the statistical and analytical estimation of mass and radius even when the correction terms are considered. Furthermore, in all of the six sources, we find that a H-poor photosphere and a large touchdown radius are favored statistically regardless of the statistical method. Our Bayesian analysis also hints that touchdown can occur farther from the neutron star surface when the photosphere is more H-poor. This correlation could be qualitatively understood with the Eddington flux equation. We propose a physical explanation for this correlation between the photospheric composition and the touchdown radius. Our results show that when accounting for the uncertainties of the photospheric composition and the touchdown radius, most likely radii of the neutron stars in these six LMXBs are less than 12.5 km, which is similar to the bounds for the neutron star radius placed with the tidal deformability measured from the gravitational wave signal.

title: Testing general relativity with gravitational-wave catalogs: the insidious nature of waveform systematics
authors: Christopher J. Moore, Eliot Finch, Riccardo Buscicchio, Davide Gerosa
topic: Gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes allow new tests of general relativity to be performed on strong, dynamical gravitational fields. These tests require accurate waveform models of the gravitational-wave signal, otherwise waveform errors can erroneously suggest evidence for new physics. Existing waveforms are generally thought to be accurate enough for current observations, and each of the events observed to date appears to be individually consistent with general relativity. In the near future, with larger gravitational-wave catalogs, it will be possible to perform more stringent tests of gravity by analyzing large numbers of events together. However, there is a danger that waveform errors can accumulate among events: even if the waveform model is accurate enough for each individual event, it can still yield erroneous evidence for new physics when applied to a large catalog. This paper presents a simple linearised analysis, in the style of a Fisher matrix calculation, that reveals the conditions under which the apparent evidence for new physics due to waveform errors grows as the catalog size increases. We estimate that, in the worst-case scenario, evidence for a deviation from general relativity might appear in some tests using a catalog containing as few as 10-30 events above a signal-to-noise ratio of 20. This is close to the size of current catalogs and highlights the need for caution when performing these sorts of experiments.

authors: Freek Roelofs, Christian M. Fromm, Yosuke Mizuno, Jordy Davelaar, Michael Janssen, Ziri Younsi, Luciano Rezzolla, Heino Falcke
topic: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has imaged the shadow of the supermassive black hole in M87. A library of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GMRHD) models was fit to the observational data, providing constraints on black hole parameters. We investigate how much better future experiments can realistically constrain these parameters and test theories of gravity. We generate realistic synthetic 230 GHz data from representative input models taken from a GRMHD image library for M87, using the 2017, 2021, and an expanded EHT array. The synthetic data are run through a data reduction pipeline used by the EHT. Additionally, we simulate observations at 230, 557, and 690 GHz with the Event Horizon Imager (EHI) Space VLBI concept. Using one of the EHT parameter estimation pipelines, we fit the GRMHD library images to the synthetic data and investigate how the black hole parameter estimations are affected by different arrays and repeated observations. Repeated observations play an important role in constraining black hole and accretion parameters as the varying source structure is averaged out. A modest expansion of the EHT already leads to stronger parameter constraints. High-frequency observations from space rule out all but ~15% of the GRMHD models in our library, strongly constraining the magnetic flux and black hole spin. The 1σ constraints on the black hole mass improve by a factor of five with repeated high-frequency space array observations as compared to observations with the current ground array. If the black hole spin, magnetization, and electron temperature distribution can be independently constrained, the shadow size for a given black hole mass can be tested to ~0.5% with the EHI, which allows tests of deviations from general relativity. High-precision tests of the Kerr metric become within reach from observations of the Galactic Center black hole Sagittarius A*.

title: Implementation of Monte-Carlo transport in the general relativistic SpEC code
authors: Francois Foucart, Matthew D. Duez, Francois Hebert, Lawrence E. Kidder, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel
topic: Neutrino transport and neutrino-matter interactions are known to play an important role in the evolution of neutron star mergers, and of their post-merger remnants. Neutrinos cool remnants, drive post-merger winds, and deposit energy in the low-density polar regions where relativistic jets may eventually form. Neutrinos also modify the composition of the ejected material, impacting the outcome of nucleosynthesis in merger outflows and the properties of the optical/infrared transients that they power (kilonovae). So far, merger simulations have largely relied on approximate treatments of the neutrinos (leakage, moments) that simplify the equations of radiation transport in a way that makes simulations more affordable, but also introduces unquantifiable errors in the results. To improve on these methods, we recently published a first simulation of neutron star mergers using a low-cost Monte-Carlo algorithm for neutrino radiation transport. Our transport code limits costs in optically thick regions by placing a hard ceiling on the value of the absorption opacity of the fluid, yet all approximations made within the code are designed to vanish in the limit of infinite numerical resolution. We provide here an in-depth description of this algorithm, of its implementation in the SpEC merger code, and of the expected impact of our approximations in optically thick regions. We argue that the latter is a subdominant source of error at the accuracy reached by current simulations, and for the interactions currently included in our code. We also provide tests of the most important features of this code.

title: Unified thermal model for photohadronic neutrino production in astrophysical sources
authors: Damiano F. G. Fiorillo, Arjen Van Vliet, Stefano Morisi, Walter Winter
topic: High-energy astrophysical neutrino fluxes are, for many applications, modeled as simple power laws as a function of energy. While this is reasonable in the case of neutrino production in hadronuclear pp sources, it typically does not capture the behavior in photohadronic p\gamma sources: in that case, the neutrino spectrum depends on the properties of the target photons the cosmic rays collide with and on possible magnetic-field effects on the secondary pions and muons. We show that the neutrino production from known photohadronic sources can be reproduced by a thermal (black-body) target-photon spectrum if one suitably adjusts the temperature, thanks to multi-pion production processes. This allows discussing neutrino production from most known pγ sources, such as gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events, in terms of a few parameters. We apply this thermal model to study the sensitivity of different classes of neutrino telescopes to photohadronic sources: we classify the model parameter space according to which experiment is most suitable for detection of a specific source class and demonstrate that different experiment classes, such as dense arrays, conventional neutrino telescopes, or radio-detection experiments, cover different parts of the parameter space. Since the model can also reproduce the flavor and neutrino-antineutrino composition, we study the impact on the track-to-shower ratio and the Glashow resonance.

title: Equation of state constraints from multi-messenger observations of neutron star mergers
authors: Andreas Bauswein
topic: The very first detection of gravitational waves from a neutron star binary merger, GW170817, exceeded all expectations. The event was relatively nearby, which may point to a relatively high merger rate. It was possible to extract finite-size effects from the gravitational-wave signal, which constrains the nuclear equation of state. Also, an electromagnetic counterpart was detected at many wavebands from radio to gamma rays marking the begin of a new multi-messenger era involving gravitational waves. We describe how multi-messenger observations of GW170817 are employed to constrain the nuclear equation of state. Combining the information from the optical emission and the mass measurement through gravitational waves leads to a lower limit on neutron star radii. According to this conservative analysis, which employs a minimum set of assumptions, the radii of neutron stars with typical masses should be larger than about 10.7~km. This implies a lower limit on the tidal deformability of about 210, while much stronger lower bounds are not supported by the data of GW170817. The multi-messenger interpretation of GW170817 rules out very soft nuclear matter and complements the upper bounds on NS radii which are derived from the measurement of finite-size effects during the pre-merger phase. We highlight the future potential of multi-messenger observations and of GW measurements of the postmerger phase for constraining the nuclear equation of state. Finally, we propose an observing strategy to maximize the scientific yield of future multi-messenger observations.

title: Do LIGO/Virgo black hole mergers produce AGN flares? The case of GW190521 and prospects for reaching a confident association
authors: Antonella Palmese, Maya Fishbach, Colin J. Burke, James T. Annis, Xin Liu
topic: The recent report of an association of the gravitational-wave (GW) binary black hole (BBH) merger GW190521 with a flare in the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) J124942.3+344929 has generated tremendous excitement. However, GW190521 has one of the largest localization volumes amongst all of the GW events detected so far. The 90\% localization volume likely contains 7,400 unobscured AGN brighter than g\leq 20.5 AB mag, and it results in a \geq 70\% probability of chance coincidence for an AGN flare consistent with the GW event. We present a Bayesian formalism to estimate the confidence of an AGN association by analyzing a population of BBH events with dedicated follow-up observations. Depending on the fraction of BBH arising from AGNs, counterpart searches of (1)−(100) GW events are needed to establish a confident association, and more than an order of magnitude more for searches without followup (i.e, using only the locations of AGNs and GW events). Follow-up campaigns of the top ~5% (based on volume localization and binary mass) of BBH events with total rest frame mass \leq 50 Msun are expected to establish a confident association during the next LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run (O4), as long as the true value of the fraction of BBH giving rise to AGN flares is [>0.1]. Our formalism allows us to jointly infer cosmological parameters from a sample of BBH events that include chance coincidence flares. Until the confidence of AGN associations is established, the probability of chance coincidence must be taken into account to avoid biasing astrophysical and cosmological constraints.

title: An Efficient Signal to Noise Approximation for Eccentric Inspiraling Binaries
authors: Lisa Randall, Alexandra Shelest, Zhong-Zhi Xianyu
topic: Eccentricity has emerged as a potentially useful tool for helping to identify the origin of black hole mergers. However, owing to the large number of harmonics required to compute the amplitude of an eccentric signal, eccentric templates can be computationally very expensive, making statistical analyses to distinguish distributions from different formation channels very challenging. In this paper, we outline a method for estimating the signal-to-noise ratio for inspiraling binaries at lower frequencies such as those proposed for LISA and DECIGO. Our approximation can be useful more generally for any quasi-periodic sources. We argue that surprisingly, the signal-to-noise ratio evaluated at or near the peak frequency (of the power) is well approximated by using a constant noise curve, even if in reality the noise strain has power law dependence. We furthermore improve this initial estimate over our previous calculation to allow for frequency-dependence in the noise to expand the range of eccentricity and frequency over which our approximation applies. We show how to apply this method to get an answer accurate to within a factor of two over almost the entire projected observable frequency range. We emphasize this method is not a replacement for detailed signal processing. The utility lies chiefly in identifying theoretically useful discriminators among different populations and providing fairly accurate estimates for how well they should work. This approximation can furthermore be useful for narrowing down parameter ranges in a computationally economical way when events are observed. We furthermore show a distinctive way to identify events with extremely high eccentricity where the signal is enhanced relative to naïve expectations on the high frequency end.

title: Gaseous Dynamical Friction: A Challenge to Modern Hydrodynamical Schemes
authors: Ben Morton, Sadegh Khochfar, Jose Oñorbe
topic: The process of momentum and energy transfer from a massive body moving through a background medium, known as dynamical friction (DF), is key to our understanding of many astrophysical systems. We present a series of high-resolution simulations of gaseous DF using Lagrangian hydrodynamics solvers, in the state-of-the-art multi-physics code, GIZMO. The numerical setup is chosen to allow direct comparison to analytic predictions for DF in the range of Mach [0.2 < M < 3]. We investigate, in detail, the DF drag force, the radial structure of the wake, and their time evolution. The subsonic forces are shown to be well resolved, except at Mach numbers close to M=1. The supersonic cases, close to M=1, significantly under-shoot the predicted force. We find that for scenarios with [0.7<M<2], between 10%-50% of the expected DF force is missing. The origin of this deficit is mostly related to the wake structure close to the perturber, where the density profile of the Mach cone face shows significant smoothing, which does not improve with time. The spherical expanding perturbation of the medium is captured well by the hydro scheme, but it is the sharp density structure, at the transition from Mach cone to average density, that introduces the mismatch. However, we find a general improvement of the force deficit with time, though significant differencesremain, in agreement with other studies. This is due to (1) the structure of the far field wake being reproduced well, and (2) the fraction of total drag from the far field wake increasing with time. Dark matter sub-haloes, in typical cosmological simulations, occupy parameters similar to those tested here, suggesting that the DF which these sub-haloes experience is significantly underestimated, and hence their merger rate. Dynamical friction is a relevant benchmark and should be included as one of the standard hydro tests for astrophysical simulations.

title: X-ray properties of TDEs
authors: R. Saxton, S. Komossa, K. Auchettl, P.G Jonker
topic: Observational astronomy of tidal disruption events (TDEs) began with the detection of X-ray flares from quiescent galaxies during the ROSAT all-sky survey of 1990-1991. The flares complied with theoretical expectations, having high peak luminosities (Lx up to \geq 4x1044 erg/s), a thermal spectrum with kT~ few x 105 K, and a decline on timescales of months to years, consistent with a diminishing return of stellar debris to a black hole of mass 106-8 solar masses. These measurements gave solid proof that the nuclei of quiescent galaxies are habitually populated by a super-massive black hole. Beginning in 2000, XMM-Newton, Chandra and Swift have discovered further TDEs which have been monitored closely at multiple wavelengths. A general picture has emerged of, initially near-Eddington accretion, powering outflows of highly-ionised material, giving way to a calmer sub-Eddington phase, where the flux decays monotonically, and finally a low accretion rate phase with a harder X-ray spectrum indicative of the formation of a disk corona. There are exceptions to this rule though which at the moment are not well understood. A few bright X-ray TDEs have been discovered in optical surveys but in general X-ray TDEs show little excess emission in the optical band, at least at times coincident with the X-ray flare. X-ray TDEs are powerful new probes of accretion physics down to the last stable orbit, revealing the conditions necessary for launching jets and winds. Finally we see that evidence is mounting for nuclear and non-nuclear intermediate mass black holes based on TDE flares which are relatively hot and/or fast.

title: Prevalence of Extra Power-Law Spectral Components in Short Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Qing-Wen Tang, Kai Wang, Liang Li, Ruo-Yu Liu
topic: Prompt extra power-law (PL) spectral component is discovered in some bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which usually dominates the spectral energy distribution below tens of keV or above ~10 MeV. However, its origin is still unclear. In this letter, we present a systematic analysis for 13 \textit{Fermi} short GRBs as of August 2020, with significant keV--MeV and GeV detections at the prompt emission phase. We find that the extra PL component is a ubiquitous spectral feature for short GRBs, showing up in all 13 analyzed GRBs. The PL indices are mostly harder than −2.0, which may be well reproduced by considering the electromagnetic cascade induced by ultra-relativistic protons or electrons accelerated in the prompt emission phase. The average flux of these extra PL components positively correlates with that of the main spectral components, which implies they may share the same physical origin.

title: Signatures of r-process elements in kilonova spectra
authors: Nanae Domoto, Masaomi Tanaka, Shinya Wanajo, Kyohei Kawaguchi
topic: Binary neutron star (NS) mergers have been expected to synthesize r-process elements and emit radioactively powered radiation, called kilonova. Although r-process nucleosynthesis was confirmed by the observations of GW170817/AT2017gfo, no trace of individual elements has been identified except for strontium. In this paper, we perform systematic calculations of line strength for bound-bound transitions and radiative transfer simulations in NS merger ejecta toward element identification in kilonova spectra. We find that Sr II triplet lines appear in the spectrum of a lanthanide-poor model, which is consistent with the absorption feature observed in GW170817/AT2017gfo. The synthetic spectrum also shows the strong Ca II triplet lines. This is natural because Ca and Sr are co-produced in the material with relatively high electron fraction and their ions have similar atomic structures with only one s-electron in the outermost shell. The line strength, however, highly depends on the abundance distribution and temperature in the ejecta. For our lanthanide-rich model, the spectra show the features of doubly ionized heavy elements, such as Ce, Tb and Th. Our results suggest that the line forming region of GW170817/AT2017gfo was lanthanide-poor. We show that the Sr II and Ca II lines can be used as a probe of physical conditions in NS merger ejecta. Absence of the Ca II line features in GW170817/AT2017gfo implies that the Ca/Sr ratio is < 0.002 in mass fraction, which is consistent with nucleosynthesis for electron fraction >= 0.40 and entropy per nucleon (in units of Boltzmann constant) >= 25.

The analysis is performed under the assumption that the hadron-quark phase transition is of first order, where the low-density hadronic matter described in a unified manner by the soft QMF or the stiff DD2 equation of state (EOS) transforms into a high-density phase of quark matter modeled by the generic "Constant-sound-speed" (CSS) parameterization. The mass distribution measured for the 2.14Msun pulsar, MSP J0740+6620, is used as the lower limit on MTOV. We find the most probable values of the hybrid star maximum mass are MTOV=2.36+0.49−0.26Msun (2.39+0.47−0.28Msun) for QMF (DD2), with an absolute upper bound around 2.85Msun, to the 90% posterior credible level. Such results appear robust with respect to the uncertainties in the hadronic EOS. We also discuss astrophysical implications of this result, especially on the post-merger product of GW170817, short gamma-ray bursts, and other likely binary neutron star mergers.

title: Magnetically Arrested Disks in Quiescent Black-Hole Binaries: Formation Scenario, Observable Signatures, and Potential PeVatrons
authors: Shigeo S. Kimura, Takahiro Sudoh, Kazumi Kashiyama, Norita Kawanaka
topic: We propose magnetically arrested disks (MADs) in quiescent black-hole (BH) binaries as the origin of the multiwavelength emission, and argue that this class of sources can dominate the cosmic-ray spectrum around the knee. X-ray luminosities of Galactic BH binaries in the quiescent state are far below the Eddington luminosity, and thus, radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs) are formed in the inner region. Strong thermal and turbulent pressures in RIAFs produce outflows, which can create large-scale poloidal magnetic fields. These fields are carried to the vicinity of the BH by the rapid inflow motion, forming a MAD. Inside the MAD, non-thermal protons and electrons are naturally accelerated by magnetic reconnections or stochastic acceleration by turbulence. Both thermal and non-thermal electrons emit broadband photons via synchrotron emission, which are broadly consistent with the optical and X-ray data of the quiescent BH X-ray binaries. Moreover, protons are accelerated up to PeV energies and diffusively escape from these MADs, which can account for the cosmic-ray intensity around the knee energy.

title: Binary black hole signatures in polarized light curves
authors: Massimo Dotti, Matteo Bonetti, Daniel J. D'Orazio, Zoltan Haiman, Luis C. Ho
topic: Variable active galactic nuclei showing periodic light curves have been proposed as massive black hole binary (MBHB) candidates. In such scenarios the periodicity can be due to relativistic Doppler-boosting of the emitted light. This hypothesis can be tested through the timing of scattered polarized light. Following the results of polarization studies in type I nuclei and of dynamical studies of MBHBs with circumbinary discs, we assume a coplanar equatorial scattering ring, whose elements contribute differently to the total polarized flux, due to different scattering angles, levels of Doppler boost, and line-of-sight time delays. We find that in the presence of a MBHB, both the degree of polarization and the polarization angle have periodic modulations. The minimum of the polarization degree approximately coincides with the peak of the light curve, regardless of the scattering ring size. The polarization angle oscillates around the semi-minor axis of the projected MBHB orbital ellipse, with a frequency equal either to the binary's orbital frequency (for large scattering screen radii), or twice this value (for smaller scattering structures). These distinctive features can be used to probe the nature of periodic MBHB candidates and to compile catalogs of the most promising sub-pc MBHBs. The identification of such polarization features in gravitational-wave detected MBHBs would enormously increase the amount of physical information about the sources, allowing the measurement of the individual masses of the binary components, and the orientation of the line of nodes on the sky, even for monochromatic gravitational wave signals.

title: Binary black holes mergers from hierarchical triples in open clusters
authors: Dylan Britt, Ben Johanson, Logan Wood, M. Coleman Miller, Erez Michaely
topic: A promising channel for producing binary black hole mergers is the Lidov-Kozai orbital resonance in hierarchical triple systems. While this mechanism has been studied in isolation, the distribution of such mergers in time and across star-forming environments is not well characterized. In this work, we explore Lidov-Kozai-induced black hole mergers in open clusters, combining semi-analytic and Monte Carlo methods to calculate merger rates and delay times for eight different population models. We predict a merger rate density of ~1--10\,Gpc−3\,yr−1 for the Lidov-Kozai channel in the local universe, and all models yield delay-time distributions in which a significant fraction of binary black hole mergers (e.g., ~20\%--50\% in our baseline model) occur during the open cluster phase. Our findings suggest that a substantial fraction of mergers from hierarchical triples occur within star-forming regions in spiral galaxies.

title: Equation-of-State Constraints on the Neutron-Star Binding Energy and Tests of Binary Formation Scenarios
authors: A. Miguel Holgado
topic: The second supernova that forms double-neutron-star systems is expected to occur in a progenitor that is ultra-stripped due to binary interactions. Thus, the secondary neutron star's mass as well as the post-supernova binary's orbital parameters will depend on the nature of the collapsing progenitor core. Since neutron stars are in the strong-gravity regime, their binding energy makes up a significant fraction of their total mass-energy budget. The second neutron star's binding energy may thus provide a unique insight as to whether its progenitor was a low-mass iron core or an oxygen-neon-magnesium core. I obtain relations for the baryonic mass and binding energy incorporating both a hadronic equation-of-state catalog as well as recent multi-messenger neutron-star observations. With these relations, I obtain the first tight constraints on the baryonic mass and binding energy of three neutron stars that are thought to have formed from an ultra-stripped progenitor. With these constraints, I test if each neutron star is consistent with forming from an ONeMg core that undergoes an electron-capture supernova. From these tests, I find that this scenario can be ruled out for one of three neutron stars. Neutron-star properties and the dense-matter equation of state can thus help distinguish binary formation scenarios.

title: Three-dimensional magnetic reconnection in particle-in-cell simulations of anisotropic plasma turbulence
authors: Jeffersson A. Agudelo Rueda, Daniel Verscharen, Robert T. Wicks, Christopher J. Owen, Georgios Nicolaou, Andrew P. Walsh, Ioannis Zouganelis, Kai Germaschewski, Santiago Vargas Domínguez
topic: We use 3D fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to study the occurrence of magnetic reconnection in a simulation of decaying turbulence created by anisotropic counter-propagating low-frequency Alfvén waves consistent with critical-balance theory. We observe the formation of small-scale current-density structures such as current filaments and current sheets as well as the formation of magnetic flux ropes as part of the turbulent cascade. The large magnetic structures present in the simulation domain retain the initial anisotropy while the small-scale structures produced by the turbulent cascade are less anisotropic. To quantify the occurrence of reconnection in our simulation domain, we develop a new set of indicators based on intensity thresholds to identify reconnection events in which both ions and electrons are heated and accelerated in 3D particle-in-cell simulations. According to the application of these indicators, we identify the occurrence of reconnection events in the simulation domain and analyse one of these events in detail. The event is related to the reconnection of two flux ropes, and the associated ion and electron exhausts exhibit a complex three-dimensional structure. We study the profiles of plasma and magnetic-field fluctuations recorded along artificial-spacecraft trajectories passing near and through the reconnection region. Our results suggest the presence of particle heating and acceleration related to small-scale reconnection events within magnetic flux ropes produced by the anisotropic Alfvénic turbulent cascade in the solar wind. These events are related to current structures of order a few ion inertial lengths in size.

title: Gravitational wave signature of proto-neutron star convection: I. MHD numerical simulations
authors: Raphaël Raynaud (CEA Saclay), Pablo Cerdá-Durán (Universitat de València), Jérôme Guilet (CEA Saclay) 
topic: Gravitational waves provide a unique and powerful opportunity to constrain the dynamics in the interior of proto-neutron stars during core collapse supernovae. Convective motions play an important role in generating neutron stars magnetic fields, which could explain magnetar formation in the presence of fast rotation. We compute the gravitational wave emission from proto-neutron star convection and its associated dynamo, by post-processing three-dimensional MHD simulations of a model restricted to the convective zone in the anelastic approximation. We consider two different proto-neutron star structures representative of early times (with a convective layer) and late times (when the star is almost entirely convective). In the slow rotation regime, the gravitational wave emission follows a broad spectrum peaking at about three times the turnover frequency. In this regime, the inclusion of magnetic fields slightly decreases the amplitude without changing the spectrum significantly compared to a non-magnetised simulation. Fast rotation changes both the amplitude and spectrum dramatically. The amplitude is increased by a factor of up to a few thousands. The spectrum is characterized by several peaks associated to inertial modes, whose frequency scales with the rotation frequency. Using simple physical arguments, we derive scalings that reproduce quantitatively several aspects of these numerical results. We also observe an excess of low-frequency gravitational waves, which appears at the transition to a strong field dynamo characterized by a strong axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field. This signature of dynamo action could be used to constrain the dynamo efficiency in a proto-neutron star with future gravitational wave detections.

title: Heat blanketing envelopes of neutron stars
authors: M. V. Beznogov, A. Y. Potekhin, D. G. Yakovlev
topic: Near the surface of any neutron star there is a thin heat blanketing envelope that produces substantial thermal insulation of warm neutron star interiors and that relates the internal temperature of the star to its effective surface temperature. Physical processes in the blanketing envelopes are reasonably clear but the chemical composition is not. The latter circumstance complicates inferring physical parameters of matter in the stellar interiors from observations of the thermal surface radiation of the stars and urges one to elaborate the models of blanketing envelopes. We outline physical properties of these envelopes, particularly, the equation of state, thermal conduction, ion diffusion and others. Various models of heat blankets are reviewed, such as composed of separate layers of different elements, or containing diffusive binary ion mixtures in or out of diffusion equilibrium. The effects of strong magnetic fields in the envelopes are outlined as well as the effects of high temperatures which induce strong neutrino emission in the envelopes themselves. Finally, we discuss how the properties of the heat blankets affect thermal evolution of neutron stars and the ability to infer important information on internal structure of neutron stars from observations.

title: A Deep Learning Approach for Active Anomaly Detection of Extragalactic Transients
authors: V. Ashley Villar, Miles Cranmer, Edo Berger, Gabriella Contardo, Shirley Ho, Griffin Hosseinzadeh, Joshua Yao-Yu Lin
topic: There is a shortage of multi-wavelength and spectroscopic followup capabilities given the number of transient and variable astrophysical events discovered through wide-field, optical surveys such as the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory. From the haystack of potential science targets, astronomers must allocate scarce resources to study a selection of needles in real time. Here we present a variational recurrent autoencoder neural network to encode simulated Rubin Observatory extragalactic transient events using 1% of the PLAsTiCC dataset to train the autoencoder. Our unsupervised method uniquely works with unlabeled, real time, multivariate and aperiodic data. We rank 1,129,184 events based on an anomaly score estimated using an isolation forest. We find that our pipeline successfully ranks rarer classes of transients as more anomalous. Using simple cuts in anomaly score and uncertainty, we identify a pure (~95% pure) sample of rare transients (i.e., transients other than Type Ia, Type II and Type Ibc supernovae) including superluminous and pair-instability supernovae. Finally, our algorithm is able to identify these transients as anomalous well before peak, enabling real-time follow up studies in the era of the Rubin Observatory.

title: The hydrodynamic evolution of binary black holes embedded within the vertically stratified disks of active galactic nuclei
authors: Nicholas Kaaz, Sophie Lund Schrøder, Jeff J. Andrews, Andrea Antoni, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
topic: Stellar-mass black holes can become embedded within the gaseous disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Afterwards, their interactions are mediated by their gaseous surroundings. In this work, we study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) embedded within AGN disks using a combination of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and analytic methods, focusing on environments in which the AGN disk scale height H is \geq the BBH sphere of influence. We model the local surroundings of the embedded BBHs using a wind tunnel formalism and characterize different accretion regimes based on the local properties of the disk, which range from wind-dominated to quasi-spherical. We use our simulations to develop prescriptions for mass accretion and drag for embedded BBHs. We use these prescriptions, along with AGN disk models that can represent the Toomre-unstable outer regions of AGN disks, to study the long-term evolution of the BBHs as they migrate through the disk. We find that BBHs typically merge within \leq 5−30Myr, increasing their mass significantly in the process, allowing BBHs to enter (or cross) the pair-instability supernova mass gap. The rate at which gas is supplied to these BBHs often exceeds the Eddington limit, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. We conclude that most embedded BBHs will merge before migrating significantly in the disk. Depending on the conditions of the ambient gas and the distance to the system, LISA can detect the transition between the gas-dominated and gravitational wave dominated regime for inspiraling BBHs that are formed sufficiently close to the AGN (\leq 0.1 pc). We also discuss possible electromagnetic signatures during and following the inspiral, finding that it is generally unlikely but not inconceivable for the bolometric luminosity of the BBH to exceed that of the host AGN.

title: Accretion-Induced Collapse of Neutron Stars in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei
authors: Rosalba Perna, Hiromichi Tagawa, Zoltan Haiman, Imre Bartos
topic: The disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have emerged as a rich environment for the evolution of stars and their compact remnants. The very dense medium favors rapid accretion, while torques and migration traps enhance binary formation and mergers. Both long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are hence expected. We show that AGN disks constitute an ideal environment for another interesting phenomenon: the accretion induced collapse (AIC) of neutron stars (NSs) to black holes (BHs). Rapid accretion in the dense disks can cause NSs to grow to the point of exceeding the maximum mass allowed by their equation of state. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations have shown that electromagnetic signatures are expected if the NS is surrounded by a mini-disk prior to collapse, which then rapidly accretes onto the BH, and/or if the NS is highly magnetized, from reconnection of the magnetosphere during collapse. Here we compute the rates of AICs and their locations within the disks for both isolated NSs, and for (initially stable) NSs formed from NS-NS mergers. We find that the global AIC rates are ~0.07−20~Gpc−3~yr−1, and we discuss their observable prospects and signatures as they emerge from the dense disk environments.

title: Millisecond Magnetars
authors: Simone Dall'Osso, Luigi Stella
topic: Two classes of X-ray/gamma-ray sources, the Soft Gamma Repeaters and the Anomalous X-ray Pulsars have been identified with isolated, slowly spinning magnetars, neutron stars whose emission draws energy from their extremely strong magnetic field (~1015−1016 G). Magnetars are believed to form with millisecond spin period and to represent an important fraction of the whole population of young neutron stars. Newborn magnetars can convert very quickly their rotational energy into electromagnetic and/or gravitational waves, by virtue of their strong magnetic fields and fast spins. This chapter provides a brief summary of astrophysical problems and scenarios in which millisecond magnetars are believed to play a key role: these include Gamma Ray Bursts, Supernovae, Gravitational Wave events and Fast Radio Bursts.

title: Binary black hole mergers from young massive and open clusters: comparison to GWTC-2 gravitational wave data
authors: Giacomo Fragione, Sambaran Banerjee
topic: Several astrophysical scenarios have been proposed to explain the origin of the of the population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected in gravitational waves (GWs) by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration. Among them, BBH mergers assembled dynamically in young massive and open clusters have been shown to produce merger rate densities consistent with LIGO/Virgo estimated rates. We use the results of a suite of direct, high-precision N-body evolutionary models of young massive and open clusters and build the population of BBH mergers, by accounting for both a cosmologically-motivated model for the formation of young massive and open clusters and the detection probability of LIGO/Virgo. We show that our models produce dynamically-paired BBH mergers that are well consistent with the observed masses, mass ratios, effective spin parameters, and final spins of the second Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-2).

title: Delta Baryons in Neutron-Star Matter under Strong Magnetic Fields
authors: Veronica Dexheimer, Kauan D. Marquez, Débora P. Menezes
topic: In this work, we study magnetic field effects on neutron star matter containing the baryon octet and additional heavier spin 3/2 baryons (the Delta's). We make use of two different relativistic hadronic models that contain an additional vector-isovector self interaction for the mesons: one version of a relativistic mean field (RMF) model and the Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model. We find that both the additional interaction and a strong magnetic field enhance the Δ baryon population in dense matter, while decreasing the relative density of hyperons. At the same time that the vector-isovector meson interaction modifies neutron-star masses very little (less 0.1 Msun), it decreases their radii considerably, allowing both models to be in better agreement with observations. Together, these features indicate that magnetic neutron stars are likely to contain Delta baryons in their interior

title: A superfluid perspective on neutron star dynamics
authors: N. Andersson
topic: As mature neutron stars are cold (on the relevant temperature scale), one has to carefully consider the state of matter in their interior. The outer kilometer or so is expected to freeze to form an elastic crust of increasingly neutron-rich nuclei, coexisting with a superfluid neutron component, while the star's fluid core contains a mixed superfluid/superconductor. The dynamics of the star depend heavily on the parameters associated with the different phases. The presence of superfluidity brings new degrees of freedom -- in essence we are dealing with a complex multi-fluid system -- and additional features: Bulk rotation is supported by a dense array of quantised vortices, which introduce dissipation via mutual friction, and the motion of the superfluid is affected by the so-called entrainment effect. This brief survey provides an introduction to -- along with a commentary on our current understanding of -- these dynamical aspects, paying particular attention to the role of entrainment, and outlines the impact of superfluidity on neutron-star seismology.

title: Magnetar-Driven Shock Breakout Revisited and Implications for Double-Peaked Type I Superluminous Supernovae
authors: Liang-Duan Liu, He Gao, Xiao-Feng Wang, Sheng Yang
topic: The discovery of early bumps in some type-I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) before the main peaks offers an important clue to their energy source mechanisms. In this paper, we updated an analytic magnetar-powered model for fitting the multi-band light curves of double-peaked SLSNe-I: the early bump is powered by magnetar-driven shock breakout thermal emission, and the main peak is powered by a radiative diffusion through the SN ejecta as in the standard magnetar-powered model. Generally, the diffusive luminosity is greater than the shock breakout luminosity at the early time, which makes the shock breakout bumps usually not clearly seen as observed. To obtain a clear double-peaked light curve, inefficient magnetar heating at early times is required. This model is applied to three well-observed double-peaked SLSNe-I (i.e., SN2006oz, LSQ14bdq, and DES14Xtaz). We find that a relative massive SN ejecta with Mej=10.2−18.1Ms and relative large kinetic energy of SN ejecta Esn=(3.8-6.5)x1051 erg are required, and the thermalization efficiency of the magnetar heating is suppressed before tdelay, which are in the range of =15−43 days. The model can well reproduce the observed light curves, with a reasonable and similar set of physical parameters for both the early bump and the main peak, strengthening support for magnetar-powered model. In the future, modeling of the double-peaked SLSNe-I will become more feasible as more events are discovered before the early bump.

title: Ultra-compact X-ray binaries as dual-line gravitational-wave sources
authors: Arthur G. Suvorov
topic: By virtue of their sub-hour orbital periods, ultra-compact X-ray binaries are promising sources for the space-borne gravitational-wave interferometers LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. Some of these systems contain a neutron star primary, whose spin period can be measured directly via pulse timing, or indirectly through rotational modulations of burst phenomena. It is pointed out here that since actively accreting stars, with spin frequencies in the hundreds of Hz, may continuously emit appreciable gravitational waves due to the presence of accretion-built mountains, toroidal magnetic fields, and/or r-mode oscillations, such binaries are also candidate sources for ground-based interferometers. Two Galactic systems (4U 1728-34 and 4U 1820-30) are identified as being potentially detectable by both LISA and aLIGO simultaneously: a dual-line detection of this sort could provide percent-level constraints on the mass, radius, and internal magnetic field strength of the neutron star. With the Einstein Telescope, we find that at least four of the known ultra-compact binaries become dual-line visible.

title: The Impact of Black Hole Formation on Population Averaged Supernova Yields
authors: Emily J. Griffith, Tuguldur Sukhbold, David H. Weinberg, Jennifer A. Johnson, James W. Johnson, Fiorenzo Vincenzo
topic: The landscape of black hole (BH) formation -- which massive stars explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) and which implode to BHs -- profoundly affects the IMF-averaged nucleosynthetic yields of a stellar population. Building on the work of Sukhbold et al. (2016), we compute IMF-averaged yields at solar metallicity for a wide range of assumptions, including neutrino-driven engine models with extensive BH formation, models with a simple mass threshold for BH formation, and a model in which all stars from 8-120Msun explode. For plausible choices, the overall yields of alpha-elements span a factor of three, but changes in relative yields are more subtle, typically 0.05-0.2 dex. For constraining the overall level of BH formation, ratios of C and N to O or Mg are promising diagnostics. For distinguishing complex, theoretically motivated landscapes from simple mass thresholds, abundance ratios involving Mn or Ni are promising because of their sensitivity to the core structure of the CCSN progenitors. We confirm previous findings of a substantial (factor 2.5-4) discrepancy between predicted O/Mg yield ratios and observationally inferred values, implying that models either overproduce O or underproduce Mg. No landscape choice achieves across-the-board agreement with observed abundance ratios; the discrepancies offer empirical clues to aspects of massive star evolution or explosion physics still missing from the models. We find qualitatively similar results using the massive star yields of Limongi & Chieffi (2018). We provide tables of IMF-integrated yields for several landscape scenarios, and more flexible user-designed models can be implemented through the publicly available Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE; this https URL).

authors: Gražina Tautvaišienė, Carlos Viscasillas Vázquez, Šarūnas Mikolaitis, Edita Stonkutė, Renata Minkevičiūtė, Arnas Drazdauskas, Vilius Bagdonas
topic: The aim of this work is to determine abundances of neutron-capture elements for thin- and thick-disc F, G, and K stars in several sky fields near the north ecliptic pole and to compare the results with the Galactic chemical evolution models, to explore elemental gradients according to stellar ages, mean galactocentric distances, and maximum heights above the Galactic plane. The observational data were obtained with the 1.65m telescope at the Moletai Astronomical Observatory and a fibre-fed high-resolution spectrograph. Elemental abundances were determined using a differential spectrum synthesis with the MARCS stellar model atmospheres and accounting for the hyperfine-structure effects. We determined abundances of Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu for 424 thin- and 82 thick-disc stars. The sample of thick-disc stars shows a clearly visible decrease in [Eu/Mg] with increasing [Fe/H] compared to the thin-disc stars, bringing more evidence of a different chemical evolution in these two Galactic components. Abundance correlation with age slopes for the investigated thin-disc stars are slightly negative for the majority of s-process dominated elements, while r-process dominated elements have positive correlations. Our sample of thin-disc stars with ages spanning from 0.1 to 9 Gyrs give the [Y/Mg]=0.022 (±0.015)-0.027 (±0.003)*age [Gyr] relation. For the thick-disc stars, when we also took data from other studies into account, we found that [Y/Mg] cannot serve as an age indicator. The radial [El/Fe] gradients in the thin disc are negligible for the s-process dominated elements and become positive for the r-process dominated elements. The vertical gradients are negative for the light s-process dominated elements and become positive for the r-process dominated elements. In the thick disc, the radial [El/Fe] slopes are negligible, and the vertical slopes are predominantly negative.

title: Partial tidal disruption events by stellar mass black holes: gravitational instability of stream and impact from remnant core
authors: Yi-Han Wang, Rosalba Perna, Philip J. Armitage
topic: In dense star clusters, such as globular and open clusters, dynamical interactions between stars and black holes (BHs) can be extremely frequent, leading to various astrophysical transients. Close encounters between a star and a stellar mass BH make it possible for the star to be tidally disrupted by the BH. Due to the relative low mass of the BH and the small cross section of the tidal disruption event (TDE) for cases with high penetration, disruptions caused by close encounters are usually partial disruptions. The existence of the remnant stellar core and its non-negligible mass compared to the stellar mass BH alters the accretion process significantly. We study this problem with SPH simulations using the code {\tt Phantom}, with the inclusion of radiation pressure, which is important for small mass BHs. Additionally, we develop a new, more general method of computing the fallback rate which does not rely on any approximation. Our study shows that the powerlaw slope of the fallback rate has a strong dependence on the mass of the BH in the stellar mass BH regime. Furthermore, in this regime, self-gravity of the fallback stream and local instabilities become more significant, and cause the disrupted material to collapse into small clumps before returning to the BH. This results in an abrupt increase of the fallback rate, which can significantly deviate from a powerlaw. Our results will help in the identification of TDEs by stellar mass BHs in dense clusters.

title: The afterglow emission from a stratified jet in GRB 170817A
authors: K.F. Cheng, X.H. Zhao, B.B. Zhang, J.M. Bai
topic: The afterglow of GRB 170817A has been detected for more than three years, but the origin of the multi-band afterglow light curves remains under debate. A classical top-hat jet model is faced with difficulties in producing a shallow rise of the afterglow light curves as observed (Fnu prop T0.8). Here we reconsider the model of stratified ejecta with energy profile of E(>Gamma beta =E0(Gamma beta)-k as the origin of the afterglow light curves of the burst, where Gamma and beta are the Lorentz factor and speed of the ejecta, respectively. k is the power-law slope of the energy profile. We consider the ejecta are collimated into jets. Two kinds of jet evolutions are investigated, including a lateral-spreading jet and a non-lateral-spreading jet. We fit the multi-band afterglow light curves, including the X-ray data at one thousand days post-burst, and find that both the models of the spreading and non-spreading jets can fit the light curves well, but the observed angular size of the source and the apparent velocity of the flux centroid for the spreading jet model are beyond the observation limits, while the non-spreading jet model meets the observation limits. Some of the best-fit parameters for the non-spreading jet model, such as the number density of the circumburst medium -10−2 cm−3 and the total jet -kinetic energy E-4.8×1051 erg, also appear plausible. The best-fit slope of the jet energy profile is k-7.1. Our results suggest that the afterglow of GRB 170817A may arise from the stratified jet and that the lateral spreading of the jet is not significant.

title: Multiwavelength observations of Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Luciano Nicastro, Cristiano Guidorzi, Eliana Palazzi, Luca Zampieri, Massimo Turatto, Angela Gardini
topic: The origin and phenomenology of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) remains unknown in spite of more than a decade of efforts (see arXiv:astro-ph.HE/1804.09092, arXiv:astro-ph.HE/1904.07947, arXiv:astro-ph.HE/1906.05878, arXiv:astro-ph.HE/2011.03500, arXiv:astro-ph.HE/2101.04907 for a review). Though several models have been proposed to explain the observed data, none is able to explain alone the variety of events so far recorded. The leading models consider magnetars as potential FRB sources. The recent detection of FRBs from the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 seems to support them. Still emission duration and energetic budget challenge all these models. Like for other classes of objects initially detected in a single band, it appeared clear that any solution to the FRB enigma could only come from a coordinated observational and theoretical effort in a as wider as possible energy band. In particular the detection and localisation of optical/NIR or/and high-energy counterparts seemed an unavoidable starting point that could shed light on the FRB physics. Multiwavelength (MWL) search campaigns were conducted for several FRBs, in particular for repeaters. Here we summarize the observational and theoretical results and the perspectives in view of the several new sources accurately localised that will likely be identified by various radio facilities worldwide. We conclude that more dedicated MWL campaigns sensitive to the millisecond--minute timescale transients are needed to address the various aspects involved in the identification of FRB counterparts. Dedicated instrumentation could be one of the key points in this respect. In the optical/NIR band, fast photometry looks to be the only viable strategy.

title: The Role of Adaptive Ray Tracing in Analyzing Black Hole Structure
authors: Z. Gelles, B.S. Prather, D.C.M. Palumbo, M.D. Johnson, G.N. Wong, B. Georgiev
topic: The recent advent of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has made direct imaging of supermassive black holes a reality. Simulated images of black holes produced via general relativistic ray tracing and radiative transfer provide a key counterpart to these observational efforts. Black hole images have a wide range of physically interesting image structures, ranging from extremely fine scales in their lensed "photon rings" to the very large scales in their relativistic jets. The multi-scale nature of the black hole system is therefore suitable for a multi-scale approach to generating simulated images that capture all key elements of the system. Here, we present a prescription for adaptive ray tracing, which enables efficient computation of extremely high resolution images of black holes. Using the polarized ray-tracing code ipole, we image a combination of semi-analytic and GRMHD models, and we show that images can be reproduced with mean squared error of less than 0.1% even after tracing 12x fewer rays. We then use adaptive ray tracing to explore properties of the photon ring. We illustrate the behavior of individual subrings in GRMHD simulations, and we explore their signatures in interferometric visibilities.

title: Riroriro: Simulating gravitational waves and evaluating their detectability in Python
authors: Wouter G. J. van Zeist, Héloïse F. Stevance, J. J. Eldridge
topic: Riroriro is a Python package to simulate the gravitational waveforms of binary mergers of black holes and/or neutron stars, and calculate several properties of these mergers and waveforms, specifically relating to their observability by gravitational wave detectors.
The gravitational waveform simulation of Riroriro is based upon the methods of Buskirk and Babiuc-Hamilton (2019), a paper which describes a computational implementation of an earlier theoretical gravitational waveform model by Huerta et al. (2017), using post-Newtonian expansions and an approximation called the implicit rotating source to simplify the Einstein field equations and simulate gravitational waves. Riroriro's calculation of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of gravitational wave events is based on the methods of Barrett et al. (2018), with the simpler gravitational wave model Findchirp (Allen et al. (2012)) being used for comparison and calibration in these calculations.

title: Radio Observations of an Ordinary Outflow from the Tidal Disruption Event AT2019dsg
authors: Y. Cendes, K. D. Alexander, E. Berger, T. Eftekhari, P. K. G. Williams, R. Chornock
topic: We present detailed radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019dsg, obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and spanning 55−560 days post-disruption. We find that the peak brightness of the radio emission increases until ~200 days and subsequently begins to decrease steadily. Using the standard equipartition analysis, including the effects of synchrotron cooling as determined by the joint VLA-ALMA spectral energy distributions, we find that the outflow powering the radio emission is in roughly free expansion with a velocity of =0.07c, while its kinetic energy increases by a factor of about 5 from 55 to 200 days and plateaus at... which is narrow even by the standards of GRB jets; a truly relativistic outflow requires an unphysically narrow jet. The outflow velocity and kinetic energy in AT2019dsg are typical of previous non-relativistic TDEs, and comparable to those from Type Ib/c supernovae, raising doubts about the claimed association with a high-energy neutrino event.

topic: Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accreting black holes, we show that a suitable subtraction of the linear polarization per pixel from total intensity images can enhance the photon ring features. We find that the photon ring is typically a factor of =2 less polarized than the rest of the image. This is due to a combination of plasma and general relativistic effects, as well as magnetic turbulence. When there are no other persistently depolarized image features, adding the subtracted residuals over time results in a sharp image of the photon ring. We show that the method works well for sample, viable GRMHD models of Sgr A* and M87*, where measurements of the photon ring properties would provide new measurements of black hole mass and spin, and potentially allow for tests of the "no-hair" theorem of general relativity.

topic: The Kerr geometry admits the Carter symmetry, which ensures that the geodesic equations are integrable. It is shown that gravitational waveforms associated with extreme-mass-ratio inspirals involving a non-integrable compact object display `glitch' phenomena, where the frequencies of gravitational waves increase abruptly, when the orbit crosses certain spacetime regions known as Birkhoff islands. The presence or absence of these features in data from upcoming space-borne detectors will therefore allow not only for tests of general relativity, but also of fundamental spacetime symmetries.

authors: Ming-Zhe Han, Jin-Liang Jiang, Shao-Peng Tang, Yi-Zhong Fan
topic: We develop a new nonparametric method to reconstruct the Equation of State (EoS) of Neutron Star with multimessenger data. As an universal function approximator, the Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) with one hidden layer and a sigmoidal activation function can approximately fit any continuous functions. We thus implement the FFNN to construct the EoSs, by fitting the theoretical EoSs and recovering the injected parameters, and find it perform well. Then we apply this nonparametric method to analyzing the real data, including mass-tidal deformability measurement from the Binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger Gravitational Wave (GW) event GW170817 and mass-radius measurement of PSR J0030+0451 by {\it NICER}. We take the publicly available samples to construct the likelihood and use the nested sampling to obtain the posteriors of the hyper parameters of FFNN according to the Bayesian theorem, which in turn can be translated to the posteriors of EoS parameters.

title: Observable gravitational waves from tidal disruption events and their electromagnetic counterpart
authors: Hugo Pfister, Martina Toscani, Thomas Hong Tsun Wong, Jane Lixin Dai, Giuseppe Lodato, Elena M. Rossi
topic: We estimate the rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs) that will be detectable with future space-based gravitational wave detectors as well as the most probable properties of these events. We find that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be able to detect up to few 10 events, but this number will strongly depend on our ability to disentangle the signal from the noise. The future number of (non-)observation will add additional constraints on the typical age of stars surrounding central black holes (BHs), however it will not constrain the unknown regimes of the BH mass function. Most probable events will involve 10 Msun stars around few 106 Msun BHs and will be detectable in the X-ray and optical part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which may open the multi-messenger era for TDEs. The generation of detectors following LISA will routinely detect gravitational waves from TDEs at cosmological distances.

title: Detectability of "Merger-nova" emission from long-lived magnetar in short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Yong Yuan, Hou-Jun Lü, Hao-Yu Yuan, Shuai-Bing Ma, Wei-Hua Lei, En-Wei Liang
topic: One possible progenitor of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is thought to be from double neutron star (NS) merger, and the remnant of such merger may be a supra-massive NS which supported by rigid rotation with surviving hundreds of seconds before collapsing into a black hole (BH). If this is the case, an optical/infrared transient (namely merger-nova) generated from the ejected materials and it powered by radioactive decay from r-process, spin-down energy from supra-massive NS, as well as the magnetic wind from new-born BH. In this paper, we systematically search for signature of supra-massive NS central engine by analysing the X-ray emission of short GRBs with internal plateau observed by {\em Swift}, and find that five candidates of short GRBs have such feature with redshift measurement. Then, we calculate the possible merger-nova emission from those candidates for given the typical model parameters by considering above three energy sources, and compare its brightness with the sensitivity of some optical telescopes. We find that the merger-nova emission of GRB 060801 in K-, r-, and U-band with variation of ... as well as Roman Space Telescope, except for the case of large ejecta mass ... However, it is very hopeful to detect the merger-nova emission of GRBs 090515, 100625A and 101219A by more sensitive instruments of Vera C. Rubin, Pan-STARRS, and Roman. Moreover, the merger-nova emission of GRB 160821B is bright enough to be detected in our calculations, and it is also consistent with current real observations of merger-nova emission.

authors: Arvind Balasubramanian, Alessandra Corsi, Kunal P. Mooley, Murray Brightman, Gregg Hallinan, Kenta Hotokezaka, David L. Kaplan, Davide Lazzati, Eric J. Murphy
topic: We present new radio observations of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very large Array (VLA) more than 3yrs after the merger. Our combined dataset is derived by co-adding more than ≈32hours of VLA time on-source, and as such provides the deepest combined observation (RMS sensitivity eq 0.99μJy) of the GW170817 field obtained to date at 3GHz. We find no evidence for a late-time radio re-brightening at a mean epoch of t≈1200d since merger, in contrast to a 2−3σ excess observed at X-ray wavelengths at the same mean epoch. Our measurements agree with expectations from the post-peak decay of the radio afterglow of the GW170817 structured jet. Using these results, we constrain the parameter space of models that predict a late-time radio re-brightening possibly arising from the high-velocity tail of the GW170817 kilonova ejecta, which would dominate the radio and X-ray emission years after the merger (once the structured jet afterglow fades below detection level). Our results point to a steep energy-speed distribution of the kilonova ejecta (with energy-velocity power law index α\geq 5). We suggest possible implications of our radio analysis, when combined with the recent tentative evidence for a late-time re-brightening in the X-rays, and highlight the need for continued radio-to-X-ray monitoring to test different scenarios.

title: Long characteristics vs. short characteristics in 3D radiative transfer simulations of polarized radiation
authors: A. de Vicente, T. del Pino Alemán, J. Trujillo Bueno
topic: We compare maps of scattering polarization signals obtained from three-dimensional (3D) radiation transfer calculations in a magneto-convection model of the solar atmosphere using formal solvers based on the "short characteristics" (SC) and the "long characteristics" (LC) methods. The SC method requires less computational work, but it is known to introduce spatial blurring in the emergent radiation for inclined lines of sight. For polarized radiation this effect is generally more severe due to it being a signed quantity and to the sensitivity of the scattering polarization to the model's inhomogeneities. We study the differences in the polarization signals of the emergent spectral line radiation calculated with such formal solvers. We take as a case study already published results of the scattering polarization in the Sr I 4607 Å line obtained with the SC method, demonstrating that in high-resolution grids it is accurate enough for that type of study. In general, the LC method is the preferred one for accurate calculations of the emergent radiation, reason why it is now one of the options in the public version of the 3D radiative transfer code PORTA.

title: Black Hole Leftovers: The Remnant Population from Binary Black Hole Mergers
authors: Zoheyr Doctor, Ben Farr, Daniel E. Holz
topic: The inspiral and merger of two black holes produces a remnant black hole with mass and spin determined by the properties of its parent black holes. Using the inferred population properties of component black holes from the first two and a half observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Virgo, we calculate the population properties of the leftover remnant black holes. By integrating their rate of formation over the age of the universe, we estimate the number density of remnant black holes today. Using simple prescriptions for the cosmic star formation rate and black hole inspiral delay times, we determine the number density of this leftover black hole population to be 660+440−240Mpc−3, corresponding to ~5000 black hole remnants per Milky-Way-equivalent galaxy. The mass spectrum of these remnants starts at ~10Msun and can be approximated by a decreasing exponential with characteristic length ~15Msun, the final spin distribution is sharply peaked at χf~0.7, and the kick velocities range from tens to thousands of km/s. These kick velocities suggest that globular clusters and nuclear star clusters may retain up to 3+3−2% and 46+17−15% of their remnant black holes, respectively, while young star clusters would only retain a few tenths of a percent. The estimates in this work assume that none of the remnants participate in subsequent hierarchical mergers. If hierarchical mergers occur, the overall number density would drop accordingly and the remnant mass distribution shape would evolve over time. This population of leftover black holes is an inescapable result from gravitational-wave observations of binary black-hole mergers.

title: Prospects for Multimessenger Observations of Thorne-Żytkow Objects
authors: Lindsay DeMarchi, J.R. Sanders, Emily M. Levesque
topic: Thorne-Żytkow objects (TŻOs) are a class of stellar object comprised of a neutron star core surrounded by a large and diffuse envelope. Their exterior appearance is identical to red supergiants; the distinctive electromagnetic signature of a TŻO is a suite of unusual chemical abundance patterns, including excesses of Li, Rb, Mo, and Ca. However, electromagnetic observations cannot unambiguously identify the presence of a neutron star core. Detection of continuous gravitational wave emission from a rotating neutron star core would provide strong supporting evidence for the existence of TŻOs. We present a model for gravitational wave detector confirmation of TŻOs and demonstrate that these objects should be detectable with Advanced LIGO. We also investigate possible targets for joint optical and gravitational searches, and comment on prospects for detectability in both current and future gravitational wave detector networks.

title: The response of the Convolutional Neural Network to the transient noise in Gravitational wave detection
authors: Chao Zhan, Mingzhen Jia, Cunliang Ma, Zhongliang Lu, Wenbin Lin
topic: In recent years, much work have studied the use of convolutional neural networks for gravitational-wave detection. However little work pay attention to whether the transient noise can trigger the CNN model or not. In this paper, we study the responses of the sine-Gaussian glitches, the Gaussian glitches and the ring-down glitches in the trained convolutional neural network classifier. We find that the network is robust to the sine-Gaussian and Gaussian glitches, whose false alarm probabilities are close to that of the LIGO-like noises, in contrast to the case of the ring-down glitches, in which the false alarm probability is far larger than that of the LIGO-like noises. We also investigate the responses of the glitches with different frequency. We find that when the frequency of the glitches falls in that of the trained GW signals, the false alarm probability of the glitches will be much larger than that of the LIGO-like noises, and the probability of the glitches being misjudged as the GW signals may even exceed 30%.

title: First and second-generation black hole and neutron star mergers in 2+2 quadruples: population statistics
authors: Adrian S. Hamers, Giacomo Fragione, Patrick Neunteufel, Bence Kocsis
topic: Recent detections of gravitational waves from mergers of neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) in the low and high-end mass gap regimes (with masses between ~2-5 MSun and exceeding ~50 MSun, respectively) pose a puzzle to standard stellar and binary evolution theory. Mass-gap mergers may originate from successive mergers in hierarchical systems such as quadruples. Here, we consider repeated mergers of NSs and BHs in stellar 2+2 quadruple systems. Under certain circumstances, secular evolution acts to accelerate the merger of one of the inner binaries. Subsequently, the merger remnant may interact with the companion binary, yielding a second-generation merger event. We model the initial stellar and binary evolution of the inner binaries as isolated systems. In the case of successful compact object formation, we subsequently follow the secular dynamical evolution of the quadruple system. When a merger occurs, we take into account merger recoil, and model subsequent evolution using direct N-body methods. With different assumptions on the initial binary properties, we find that the majority of first-generation mergers are not much affected by secular evolution, with their observational properties mostly consistent with isolated binaries. A small subset shows imprints of secular evolution through residual eccentricity in the LIGO band, and retrograde spin-orbit orientations. Second-generation mergers can be strongly affected by scattering (i.e., three-body interactions) induced by the first-generation merger. In particular, scattering can account for mergers within the low-end mass gap, although not the high-end mass gap. Also, scattering could explain highly eccentric LIGO sources and negative effective spin parameters.

title: Electromagnetic Signatures from the Tidal Tail of a Black Hole - Neutron Star Merger
authors: Siva Darbha, Daniel Kasen, Francois Foucart, Daniel J. Price
topic: Black hole - neutron star (BH-NS) mergers are a major target for ground-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories. A merger can also produce an electromagnetic counterpart (a kilonova) if it ejects neutron-rich matter that assembles into heavy elements through r-process nucleosynthesis. We study the kilonova signatures of the unbound dynamical ejecta of a BH-NS merger. We take as our initial state the results from a numerical relativity simulation, and then use a general relativistic hydrodynamics code to study the evolution of the ejecta with parameterized r-process heating models. The unbound dynamical ejecta is initially a flattened, directed tidal tail largely confined to a plane. Heating from the r-process inflates the ejecta into a more spherical shape and smooths its small-scale structure, though the ejecta retains its bulk directed motion. We calculate the electromagnetic signatures using a 3D radiative transfer code and a parameterized opacity model for lanthanide-rich matter. The light curve varies with viewing angle due to two effects: asphericity results in brighter emission for orientations with larger projected areas, while Doppler boosting results in brighter emission for viewing angles more aligned with the direction of bulk motion. For typical r-process heating rates, the peak bolometric luminosity varies by a factor of ~3 with orientation while the peak in the optical bands varies by ~3 magnitudes. The spectrum is blue-shifted at viewing angles along the bulk motion, which increases the V-band peak magnitude to ~−14 despite the lanthanide-rich composition.

title: Polarization Predictions in the GRB Prompt Phase with the Internal Shock Model
authors: Mi-Xiang Lan, Hao-Bing Wang, Siyao Xu, Siming Liu, Xue-Feng Wu
topic: As the standard gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt-emission model, the internal shock (IS) model can reproduce the fast-rise and slow-decay features of the pulses in the GRB light curve. The time- and energy-dependent polarization can deliver important physical information on the emission region and can be used to test models. Polarization predictions for the GRB prompt phase with the magnetized IS model should be investigated carefully. The magnetic field of the magnetized IS model is very likely to be mixed and decays with radius. The synchrotron emission in the presence of such a decaying magnetic field can recover the Band-like spectrum of the GRB prompt phase. We investigate the dependence of the polarization of GRB prompt emission on both time and energy in the framework of the magnetized IS model. Due to the large range of parameters, it is hard to distinguish the magnetized IS model and the magnetic-reconnection model through polarization degree (PD) curves. The energy-dependent PD could increase toward the high-energy band for the magnetized IS model, while it decreases to zero above the megaelectronvolt band for the dissipative photosphere model. Therefore, we conclude that the energy dependence of PD can be used to distinguish these two models for the GRB prompt emission. Finally, we find that, independent of the observational energy band, the profiles of the xi-B-PD curve for the time-integrated and time-resolved PDs are very similar, where ξB is the magnetic field strength ratio of the ordered component to the random component.

title: Neutrino Fast Flavor Conversions in Neutron-star Post-Merger Accretion Disks
authors: Xinyu Li, Daniel M. Siegel
topic: A compact accretion disk may be formed in the merger of two neutron stars or of a neutron star and a stellar-mass black hole. Outflows from such accretion disks have been identified as a major site of rapid neutron-capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis and as the source of 'red' kilonova emission following the first observed neutron-star merger GW170817. We present long-term general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a typical post-merger accretion disk at initial accretion rates of M~1Msun s−1 over 400ms post-merger. We include neutrino radiation transport that accounts for effects of neutrino fast flavor conversions dynamically. We find ubiquitous flavor oscillations that result in a significantly more neutron-rich outflow, providing lanthanide and 3rd-peak r-process abundances similar to solar abundances. This provides strong evidence that post-merger accretion disks are a major production site of heavy r-process elements. A similar flavor effect may allow for increased lanthanide production in collapsars. The formalism presented here may also be used in simulations of core-collapse supernovae to explore whether fast conversions strengthen or weaken the explosion.

topic: Mergers of black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binaries are expected to be observed by gravitational wave (GW) detectors in the coming years. Such observations will not only provide confirmation that these systems exist, but will also give unique insights into the death and lives of massive (binary) stars and their possible association with gamma-ray bursts, r-process enrichment, and kilonovae. Here we present binary population synthesis of isolated BHNS systems in order to predict their merger rate and characteristics for ground-based GW observatories. We present the results for 420 different model permutations that explore key uncertainties in our assumptions about massive binary star evolution (e.g., mass transfer, common-envelope evolution, supernovae), and in our assumptions for the metallicity-specific star formation rate density, and characterize their relative impacts on our predictions. We predict intrinsic local BHNS merger rates in the range [] and detected rates in the range []  for a GW network consisting of LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA at design sensitivity.

title: Outflow Bubbles from Compact Binary Mergers Embedded in Active Galactic Nuclei: Cavity Formation and the Impact on Electromagnetic Counterparts
authors: Shigeo S. Kimura, Kohta Murase, Imre Bartos
topic: We propose a novel scenario for possible electromagnetic (EM) emission by compact binary mergers in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Nuclear star clusters in AGNs are a plausible formation site of compact-stellar binaries (CSBs) whose coalescences can be detected through gravitational waves (GWs). We investigate the accretion onto and outflows from CSBs embedded in AGN disks. We show that these outflows are likely to create outflow "cavities" in the AGN disks before the binaries merge, which makes EM or neutrino counterparts much less common than would otherwise be expected. We discuss the necessary conditions for detectable EM counterparts to mergers inside the outflow cavities. If the merger remnant black hole experiences a high recoil velocity and can enter the AGN disk, it can accrete gas with a super-Eddington rate, newly forming a cavity-like structure. This bubble can break out of the disk within a day to a week after the merger. Such breakout emission can be bright enough to be detectable by current soft X-ray instruments, such as {\it Swift}-XRT and {\it Chandra}.

topic: The Advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave observatories detected a signal on 2019 August 14 during their third observing run, named GW190814. A large number of electromagnetic facilities conducted follow-up campaigns in the search for a possible counterpart to the gravitational wave event, which was made especially promising given the early source classification of a neutron star-black hole merger. We present the results of the GW follow-up campaign taken with the wide-field optical telescope MeerLICHT, located at the South African Astronomical Observatory Sutherland site. We use our results to constrain possible kilonova models. MeerLICHT observed more than 95% of the probability localisation each night for over a week in three optical bands (u,q,i) with our initial observations beginning almost 2 hours after the GW detection. We describe the search for new transients in MeerLICHT data and investigate how our limiting magnitudes can be used to constrain an AT2017gfo-like kilonova. A single new transient was found in our analysis of MeerLICHT data, which we exclude from being the electromagnetic counterpart to GW190814 due to the existence of a spatially unresolved source at the transient's coordinates in archival data. Using our limiting magnitudes, the confidence with which we can exclude the presence of an AT2017gfo-like kilonova at the distance of GW190814 was low.

topic: The many unusual properties of the enigmatic AT2018cow suggested that at least some subset of the empirical class of fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) represents a genuinely new astrophysical phenomenon. Unfortunately, the intrinsic rarity and fleeting nature of these events have made it difficult to identify additional examples early enough to acquire the observations necessary to constrain theoretical models. We present here the Zwicky Transient Facility discovery of AT2020xnd (ZTF20acigmel, the "Camel") at z=0.243, the first unambiguous AT2018cow analog to be found and confirmed in real time. AT2018cow and AT2020xnd share all key observational properties: a fast optical rise, sustained high photospheric temperature, absence of a second peak attributable to ejection of a radioactively-heated stellar envelope, extremely luminous radio, millimetre, and X-ray emission, and a dwarf-galaxy host. This supports the argument that AT2018cow-like events represent a distinct phenomenon from slower-evolving radio-quiet supernovae, likely requiring a different progenitor or a different central engine. The sample properties of the four known members of this class to date disfavour tidal disruption models but are consistent with the alternative model of an accretion powered jet following the direct collapse of a massive star to a black hole. Contextual filtering of alert streams combined with rapid photometric verification using multi-band imaging provides an efficient way to identify future members of this class, even at high redshift.

We calculate the neutrino emissivity of the direct Urca process, whereby a neutron converts to a proton, an electron and an antineutrino, or proton-electron pair converts to a neutron-electron pair. We solve exact wave functions for protons and electrons in the states described with Landau levels. We find that in the strong magnetic fields the direct Urca process can occur in density regions where this process could not normally occur in the absence of a magnetic field. This is because of the kinematical condition.

title: An early peak in the radio light curve of short-duration Gamma-Ray Burst 200826A
authors: Lauren Rhodes, Rob Fender, David R.A. Williams, Kunal Mooley
topic: We present the results of radio observations from the eMERLIN telescope combined with X-ray data from Swift for the short-duration Gamma-ray burst (GRB) 200826A, located at a redshift of 0.71. The radio light curve shows evidence of a sharp rise, a peak around 4-5 days post-burst, followed by a relatively steep decline. We provide two possible interpretations based on the time at which the light curve reached its peak. (1) If the light curve peaks earlier, the peak is produced by the synchrotron self-absorption frequency moving through the radio band, resulting from the forward shock propagating into a wind medium and (2) if the light curve peaks later, the turn over in the light curve is caused by a jet break. In the former case, we find a minimum equipartition energy of ~3x10^47 erg and bulk Lorentz factor of ~5, while in the latter case we estimate the jet opening angle of ~9-16 degrees. Due to the lack of data, it is impossible to determine which is the correct interpretation, however, due to its relative simplicity and consistency with other multi-wavelength observations which hint at the possibility that GRB 200826A is in fact a long GRB, we prefer scenario one over scenario two.

title: Perfect is the enemy of good enough: predicting electromagnetic counterparts using low-latency, gravitational-wave data products
authors: Cosmin Stachie, Michael W. Coughlin, Tim Dietrich, Sarah Antier, Mattia Bulla, Nelson Christensen, Reed Essick, Philippe Landry, Benoit Mours, Federico Schianchi, Andrew Toivonen
topic: Searches for gravitational-wave counterparts have been going in earnest since GW170817 and the discovery of AT2017gfo. Since then, the lack of detection of other optical counterparts connected to binary neutron star or black hole - neutron star candidates has highlighted the need for a better discrimination criterion to support this effort. At the moment, the low-latency gravitational-wave alerts contain preliminary information about the binary properties and, hence, on whether a detected binary might have an electromagnetic counterpart. The current alert method is a classifier that estimates the probability that there is a debris disk outside the black hole created during the merger as well as the probability of a signal being a binary neutron star, a black hole - neutron star, a binary black hole or of terrestrial origin. In this work, we expand upon this approach to predict both the ejecta properties and provide contours of potential lightcurves for these events in order to improve follow-up observation strategy. To validate the method, we test our approach on real events from the second and third Advanced LIGO-Virgo observing runs.

title: Numerical Inside View of Hypermassive Remnant Models for GW170817
authors: Wolfgang Kastaun, Frank Ohme
topic: The first multimessenger observation attributed to a merging neutron star binary provided an enormous amount of observational data. Unlocking the full potential of this data requires a better understanding of the merger process and the early post-merger phase, which are crucial for the later evolution that eventually leads to observable counterparts. In this work, we perform standard hydrodynamical numerical simulations of a system compatible with GW170817. We focus on a single equation of state (EOS) and two mass ratios, while neglecting magnetic fields and neutrino radiation. We then apply newly developed postprocessing and visualization techniques to the results obtained for this basic setting. The focus lies on understanding the three-dimensional structure of the remnant, most notably the fluid flow pattern, and its evolution until collapse. We investigate the evolution of mass and angular momentum distribution up to collapse, as well as the differential rotation along and perpendicular to the equatorial plane. For the cases that we studied, the remnant cannot be adequately modeled as a differentially rotating axisymetric NS. Further, the dominant aspect leading to collapse is the GW radiation and not internal redistribution of angular momentum. We relate features of the gravitational wave signal to the evolution of the merger remnant, and make the waveforms publicly available. Finally, we find that the three-dimensional vorticity field inside the disk is dominated by medium-scale perturbances and not the orbital velocity, with potential consequences for magnetic field amplification effects.

title: Observational properties of a general relativistic instability supernova from a primordial supermassive star
authors: Takashi J. Moriya, Ke-Jung Chen, Kimihiko Nakajima, Nozomu Tominaga, Sergei I. Blinnikov
topic: We present the expected observational properties of a general relativistic instability supernova (GRSN) from the 55,500 Msun primordial (Population III) star. Supermassive stars exceeding 1e4 Msun may exist in the early Universe. They are generally considered to collapse through the general relativistic instability to be seed black holes to form supermassive (~ 1e9 Msun) black holes observed as high-redshift quasars. Some of them, however, may explode as GRSNe if the explosive helium burning unbinds the supermassive stars following the collapse triggered by the general relativistic instability. We perform the radiation hydrodynamics simulation of the GRSN starting shortly before the shock breakout. We find that the GRSN is characterized by a long-lasting (550 d) luminous (1.5e44 erg/s) plateau phase with the photospheric temperature of around 5000 K in the rest frame. The plateau phase lasts for decades when it appears at high redshifts and it will likely be observed as a persistent source in the future deep near-infrared imaging surveys. Especially, the near-infrared images reaching 29 AB magnitude that can be obtained by Galaxy and Reionization EXplorer (G-REX) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to identify GRSNe up to z ~ 15. Deeper images enable us to discover GRSNe at even higher redshifts. Having extremely red color, they can be distinguished from other persistent sources such as high-redshift galaxies by using color information. We conclude that the deep near-infrared images are able to constrain the existence of GRSNe from the primordial supermassive stars in the Universe even without the time domain information.

title: Generating neutron-star magnetic fields: three phases of dynamo action
authors: S. K. Lander
topic: Young neutron stars (NSs) have exterior magnetic fields ranging over three or more orders of magnitude, up to around 1015 G. These fields are believed to be amplified to such high strengths by dynamo action, but neither the details of this, nor the resulting range of field strengths, is satisfactorily understood. Here we consider three possible eras in which a dynamo may operate. For the first, proto-NS, phase, we argue that generation of large-scale field is inefficient, inhibited by the relatively high fluid viscosity. Understanding dynamo action under these conditions calls for a revised theory of mean-field electrodynamics, potentially analogous to the equations for magnetic-field evolution in a type-II superconductor. In the second phase we propose a new dynamo mechanism, driven by precession. Such a dynamo would be effective even at relatively low rotation rates, and can produce the observed variation of exterior-field strengths from small differences in birth physics. It could also be a viable mechanism for long-term field generation in main-sequence stars. Finally, dynamo action in a cold NS is disfavoured, due to both a lack of suitable fluid motions and inhibition of magnetic reconnection by superconductivity.

title: Prospects for kilonova signals in the gravitational-wave era
authors: Robert Mochkovitch, Frédéric Daigne, Raphaël Duque, Hannachi Zitouni
topic: The binary neutron star merger gravitational-wave signal GW170817 was followed by three electromagnetic counter-parts, of which a kilonova arising from the radioactivity of freshly synthesized r-process elements in ejecta from the merger. Finding kilonovae after gravitational-wave triggers is crucial (i) to the search for further counterparts such as the afterglow, (ii) to probe the diversity of kilonovae and their dependence on the system's inclination angle (iii) to build a sample for multimessenger cosmology. During the third observing run of the gravitational-wave interferometer network, no kilonova counterpart was found. We aim to predict the expected population of detectable kilonova signals for the upcoming O4 and O5 observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra instruments. Using a a simplified criterion for gravitational-wave detection and a simple GW170817-calibrated model for the kilonova peak magnitude, we determine the rate of kilonovae in reach of follow-up campaigns and their distributions in magnitude for various bands. We briefly consider the case of GW190425, the only confirmed binary neutron star merger since GW170817, and obtain constraints on its inclination angle from the non-detection of its kilonova, assuming the source was below the follow-up thresholds. We also show that non gravitational-wave-triggered kilonovae can be a numerous class of sources in the future surveys and briefly discuss associations with short bright gamma-ray bursts. We finally discuss the detection of the jetted outflow afterglow in addition to the kilonova, and confirm former conclusions on the rareness of such counterparts in future observations.

title: Emission Mechanisms of Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Yuri Lyubarsky
topic: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are recently discovered mysterious single pulses of radio emission, mostly coming from cosmological distances (~1 Gpc). Their short duration, ~1 ms, and large luminosity evidence coherent emission. I review the basic physics of coherent emission mechanisms proposed for FRBs. In particular, I discuss the curvature emission of bunches, the synchrotron maser, and the emission of radio waves by variable currents in the course of magnetic reconnection. Special attention is paid to magnetar flares as the most promising sources of FRBs. Non-linear effects are outlined that could place bounds on the power of the outgoing radiation.

title: Bayesian analysis of multimessenger M-R data with interpolated hybrid EoS
authors: A. Ayriyan, D. Blaschke, A. G. Grunfeld, D. Alvarez-Castillo, H. Grigorian, V. Abgaryan
topic: We introduce a family of equations of state (EoS) for hybrid neutron star (NS) matter that is obtained by a two-zone parabolic interpolation between a soft hadronic EoS at low densities and a set of stiff quark matter EoS at high densities within a finite region of chemical potentials. Fixing the hadronic EoS as the APR one and chosing the color-superconductiong, nonlocal NJL model with two free parameters for the quark phase, we perform Bayesian analyses with this two-parameter family of hybrid EoS. Using three different sets of observational constraints that include the mass of PSR J0740+6620, the tidal deformability for GW170817 and the mass-radius relation for PSR J0030+0451 from NICER as obligatory (set 1), while set 2 uses the possible upper limit on the maximum mass from GW170817 as additional constraint and set 3 instead the possibility that the lighter object in the asymmetric binary merger GW190814 is a neutron star. We confirm that in any case the quark matter phase has to be color superconducting with the dimensionless diquark coupling approximately fulfilling the Fierz relation ηD=0.75 and the most probable solutions exhibiting a proportionality between ηD and ηV, the coupling of the repulsive vector interaction that is required for a sufficiently large maximum mass. We anticipate the outcome of the NICER radius measurement on PSR J0740+6220 as a fictitious constraint and find evidence for claiming that GW190814 was a binary black hole merger if the radius will be 11 km or less.

title: Fully General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Accretion Flows onto Spinning Massive Black Hole Binary Mergers
authors: Federico Cattorini, Bruno Giacomazzo, Francesco Haardt, Monica Colpi
topic: We perform the first suite of fully general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of spinning massive black hole binary mergers. We consider binary black holes with spins of different magnitudes aligned to the orbital angular momentum, which are immersed in a hot, magnetized gas cloud. We investigate the effect of the spin and degree of magnetization on the properties of the accretion flow. We find that magnetized accretion flows are characterized by more turbulent dynamics, as the magnetic field lines are twisted and compressed during the late inspiral. Post-merger, the polar regions around the spin axis of the remnant Kerr black hole are magnetically dominated, and the magnetic field strength is increased by a factor. The magnetized gas in the equatorial plane acquires higher angular momentum, and settles in a thin circular structure around the black hole. We find that mass accretion rates of magnetized configurations are generally smaller than in the unmagnetized cases by up to a factor ~3. Black hole spins have also a suppressing effect on the accretion rate, as large as ~48\%. As a potential driver for electromagnetic emission we follow the evolution of the Poynting luminosity, which increases after merger up to a factor ~2 with increasing spin, regardless of the initial level of magnetization of the fluid. Our results stress the importance of taking into account both spins and magnetic fields when studying accretion processes onto merging massive black holes.

title: Axions: From Magnetars and Neutron Star Mergers to Beam Dumps and BECs
authors: Jean-François Fortin, Huai-Ke Guo, Steven P. Harris, Doojin Kim, Kuver Sinha, Chen Sun
topic: We review topics in searches for axion-like-particles (ALPs), covering material that is complementary to other recent reviews. The first half of our review covers ALPs in the extreme environments of neutron star cores, the magnetospheres of highly magnetized neutron stars (magnetars), and in neutron star mergers. The focus is on possible signals of ALPs in the photon spectrum of neutron stars and gravitational wave/electromagnetic signals from neutron star mergers. We then review recent developments in laboratory-produced ALP searches, focusing mainly on accelerator-based facilities including beam-dump type experiments and collider experiments. We provide a general-purpose discussion of the ALP search pipeline from production to detection, in steps, and our discussion is straightforwardly applicable to most beam-dump type and reactor experiments. We end with a selective look at the rapidly developing field of ultralight dark matter, specifically the formation of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). We review the properties of BECs of ultralight dark matter and bridge these properties with developments in numerical simulations, and ultimately with their impact on experimental searches.

title: Survival of the Fittest: Numerical Modeling of Supernova 2014C
authors: Felipe Vargas, Fabio De Colle, Daniel Brethauer, Raffaella Margutti, Cristian G. Bernal
topic: Initially classified as a supernova (SN) type Ib, ~ 100 days after the explosion SN\,2014C made a transition to a SN type II, presenting a gradual increase in the Halpha emission. This has been interpreted as evidence of interaction between the supernova shock wave and a massive shell previously ejected from the progenitor star. In this paper, we present numerical simulations of the propagation of the SN shock through the progenitor star and its wind, as well as the interaction of the SN ejecta with the massive shell. To determine with high precision the structure and location of the shell, we couple a genetic algorithm to a hydrodynamic and a bremsstrahlung radiation transfer code. We iteratively modify the density stratification and location of the shell by minimizing the variance between X-ray observations and synthetic predictions computed from the numerical model. By assuming spherical symmetry, we found that the shell has a mass of 2.6 Msun, extends from 1.6 x1017 cm to 1.87x1017 cm, implying that it was ejected ~60/(vw/100kms-1) yrs before the SN explosion, and has a density stratification decaying as ~r-3. We found that the product of metallicity by the ionization fraction (due to photo-ionization by the post-shock X-ray emission) %and/or the SN UV radiation is ~ 0.5. Finally, we predict that, if the density stratification follows the same power-law behaviour, the SN will break out from the shell by mid 2022, i.e. 8.5 years after explosion.

title: Relativistic outflows from a GRMHD mean-field disk dynamo
authors: Christos Vourellis, Christian Fendt
topic: We present simulations of thin accretion disks around black holes investigating a mean-field disk dynamo in our resistive GRMHD code (Vourellis et al. 2019) that is able to produce a large scale magnetic flux. We consider a weak seed field in an initially thin disk, a background (turbulent) magnetic diffusivity and the dynamo action. A standard quenching mechanism is applied to mitigate the otherwise exponential increase of the magnetic field. Comparison simulations of an initial Fishbone-Moncrief torus suggest that reconnection may provide another quenching mechanism. The dynamo-generated magnetic flux expands from the disk interior into the disk corona, becomes advected by disk accretion, and fills the axial region of the domain. The dynamo leads to an initially rapid increase in magnetic energy and flux, while for later evolutionary stages the growth stabilizes. Accretion towards the black hole depends strongly on the magnetic field structure that develops. The radial field component supports extraction of angular momentum and thus accretion. It also sets the conditions for launching a disk wind, initially from inner disk area. When a strong field has engulfed the disk, strong winds are launched that are predominantly driven by the pressure gradient of the toroidal field. For rotating black holes we identify a Poynting flux-dominated jet, driven by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. This axial Poynting flux is advected from the disk and therefore accumulates at the expense of the flux carried by the disk wind, that is itself regenerated by the disk dynamo.

title: Frequency deviations in universal relations of isolated neutron stars and postmerger remnants
authors: Georgios Lioutas, Andreas Bauswein, Nikolaos Stergioulas
topic: We relate the fundamental quadrupolar fluid mode of isolated non-rotating NSs and the dominant oscillation frequency of neutron star merger remnants. Both frequencies individually are known to correlate with certain stellar parameters like radii or the tidal deformability, which we further investigate by constructing fit formulae and quantifying the scatter of the data points from those relations. Furthermore, we compare how individual data points deviate from the corresponding fit to all data points. Considering this point-to-point scatter we uncover a striking similarity between the frequency deviations of perturbative data for isolated NSs and of oscillation frequencies of rapidly rotating, hot, massive merger remnants. The correspondence of frequency deviations in these very different stellar systems points to an underlying mechanism and EoS information being encoded in the frequency deviation. We trace the frequency scatter back to deviations of the tidal Love number from an average tidal Love number for a given stellar compactness. Our results thus indicate a possibility to break the degeneracy between NS radii, tidal deformability and tidal Love number. We also relate frequency deviations to the derivative of the tidal deformability with respect to mass. Our findings generally highlight a possibility to improve GW asteroseismology relations where the systematic behavior of frequency deviations is employed to reduce the scatter in such relationships and consequently increase the measurement accuracy. In addition, we relate the f-mode frequency of static stars and the dominant GW frequency of merger remnants. We find an analytic mapping to connect the masses of both stellar systems, which yields particularly accurate mass-independent relations between both frequencies and between the postmerger frequency and the tidal deformability.

title: Can we observe the QCD phase transition-generated gravitational waves through pulsar timing arrays?
authors: Axel Brandenburg, Emma Clarke, Yutong He, Tina Kahniashvili
topic: We perform numerical simulations of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic turbulent sources that might have been present at cosmological quantum chromodynamic (QCD) phase transitions. For turbulent energies of about 4% of the radiation energy density, the typical scale of such motions may have been a sizable fraction of the Hubble scale at that time. The resulting GWs are found to have an energy fraction of about 10-9 of the critical energy density in the nHz range today and may already have been observed by the NANOGrav collaboration. This is further made possible by our findings of shallower spectra proportional to the square root of the frequency for nonhelical hydromagnetic turbulence. This implies more power at low frequencies than for the steeper spectra previously anticipated. The behavior toward higher frequencies depends strongly on the nature of the turbulence. For vortical hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic turbulence, there is a sharp drop of spectral GW energy by up to five orders of magnitude in the presence of helicity, and somewhat less in the absence of helicity. For acoustic hydrodynamic turbulence, the sharp drop is replaced by a power law decay, albeit with a rather steep slope. Our study supports earlier findings of a quadratic scaling of the GW energy with the magnetic energy of the turbulence and inverse quadratic scaling with the peak frequency, which leads to larger GW energies under QCD conditions.

title: Delayed Radio Flares from a Tidal Disruption Event
authors: Assaf Horesh, S. Bradley Cenko, Iair Arcavi
topic: Radio observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) - when a star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) - provide a unique laboratory for studying outflows in the vicinity of SMBHs and their connection to accretion onto the SMBH. Radio emission has been detected in only a handful of TDEs so far. Here, we report the detection of delayed radio flares from an optically-discovered TDE. Our prompt radio observations of the TDE ASASSN-15oi showed no radio emission until the detection of a flare six months later, followed by a second and brighter flare, years later. We find that the standard scenario, in which an outflow is launched briefly after the stellar disruption, is unable to explain the combined temporal and spectral properties of the delayed flare. We suggest that the flare is due to the delayed ejection of an outflow, perhaps following a transition in accretion states. Our discovery motivates observations of TDEs at various timescales and highlights a need for new models.

title: Supernova neutrino signals based on long-term axisymmetric simulations
authors: Hiroki Nagakura, Adam Burrows, David Vartanyan
topic: We study theoretical neutrino signals from core-collapse supernova (CCSN) computed using axisymmetric CCSN simulations that cover the post-bounce phase up to ~4~s. We provide basic quantities of the neutrino signals such as event rates, energy spectra, and cumulative number of events at some terrestrial neutrino detectors, and then we discuss some new features in the late phase that emerge in our models. Contrary to popular beliefs, neutrino emissions in the late phase are not always quiet, but rather have temporal fluctuations, the vigor of which hinges on the CCSN model and neutrino flavor. We find that the temporal variations are not primarily driven by proto-neutron star (PNS) convection, but by fallback accretion flows in explosion models. We assess the detectability of these temporal variations, and conclude that IceCube is the most promising detector with which to resolve them. We also update fitting formulae first proposed in our previous paper for which total neutrino energy (TONE) emitted at the CCSN source is estimated from the cumulative number of events at each detector. This will be very powerful in the data analysis of real observations, in particular for low-statistics data. As an interesting demonstration, we apply our fitting formulae to a real observation, that of SN 1987A at Kamiokande-II. The TONE is estimated as ~2x1053~erg. By combining the recent constraints on the equation-of-state, we further estimate the gravitational mass of PNS in the remnant of SN 1987A, which is

authors: Ch. Margaritis, P.S. Koliogiannis, Ch.C. Moustakidis
topic: The nuclear symmetry energy plays an important role in the description of the properties of finite nuclei as well as neutron stars. Especially, for low values of baryon density, the accurate description of the crust-core interface strongly depends on the symmetry energy. Usually, the well known parabolic approximation is employed for the definition of the symmetry energy without avoiding some drawbacks. In the present work, a class of nuclear models, suitable for the description of the inner and outer core of neutron stars, is applied in studying the effect of higher orders of the expansion of the energy on the location of the crust-core transition.

title: Nested Sampling with Normalising Flows for Gravitational-Wave Inference
authors: Michael J. Williams, John Veitch, Chris Messenger
topic: We present a novel method for sampling iso-likelihood contours in nested sampling using a type of machine learning algorithm known as normalising flows and incorporate it into our sampler nessai. Nessai is designed for problems where computing the likelihood is computationally expensive and therefore the cost of training a normalising flow is offset by the overall reduction in the number of likelihood evaluations. We validate our sampler on 128 simulated gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescence and show that it produces unbiased estimates of the system parameters. Subsequently, we compare our results to those obtained with dynesty and find good agreement between the computed log-evidences whilst requiring 2.32 times fewer likelihood evaluations. We also highlight how the likelihood evaluation can be parallelised in nessai without any modifications to the algorithm. Finally, we outline diagnostics included in nessai and how these can be used to tune the sampler's settings.

topic: We consider the Blandford-Znajek process of electromagnetic extraction of energy from a general axially symmetric asymptotically flat slowly rotating black hole. Using the general parametrization of the black-hole spacetime we construct formulas for the flux of the magnetic field and the rate of energy extraction, which are valid not only for the Kerr spacetime, but also for its arbitrary axially symmetric deformations. We show that in the dominant order these quantities depend only on a single deformation parameter, which relates the spin frequency of a black hole with its rotation parameter.

authors: Aurélien Sourie, Nicolas Chamel
topic: Our recent Newtonian treatment of the smooth-averaged mutual-friction force acting on the neutron superfluid and locally induced by the pinning of quantized neutron vortices to proton fluxoids in the outer core of superfluid neutron stars is here adapted to the general-relativistic framework. We show how the local nonrelativistic motion of individual vortices can be matched to the global dynamics of the star using the fully 4D covariant Newtonian formalism of Carter & Chamel (2004). We derive all the necessary dynamical equations for carrying out realistic simulations of superfluid rotating neutron stars in full general relativity, as required for the interpretation of pulsar frequency glitches. The role of vortex pinning on the global dynamics appears to be nontrivial.

title: General relativistic radiation transport: Implications for VLBI/EHT observations of AGN discs, winds and jets
authors: Bidisha Bandyopadhyay, Christian Fendt, Dominik R. G. Schleicher, Christos Vourellis
topic: In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) has published the first image of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) obtained via the Very Large Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) technique. In the future, it is expected that additional and more sensitive VLBI observations will be pursued for other nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), and it is therefore important to understand which possible features can be expected in such images. In this paper, we post-process General Relativistic Magneto-Hydrodynamical (GR-MHD) simulations which include resistivity, thus providing a self-consistent jet formation model (with resistive mass loading) launched from a thin disc. The ray-tracing is done using the General Relativistic Ray-Tracing code GRTRANS assuming synchrotron emission. We study the appearance of the black hole environment including the accretion disc, winds and jets under a large range of condition, varying black hole mass, accretion rate, spin, inclination angle, disc parameters and observed frequency. When we adopt M87-like parameters, we show that we can reproduce a ring-like feature (similar as observed by the EHT) for some of our simulations. The latter suggests that such thin disc models are thus likely consistent with the observed results. Depending on their masses, accretion rates, spin and other parameters, we note that other SMBHs may show additional features like winds and jets depending on the sensitivity that can be reached in the observations.

authors: V. P. Utrobin (1,2,3), A. Wongwathanarat (1), H.-Th. Janka (1), E. Mueller (1), T. Ertl (1), A. Menon (4), A. Heger
topic: Six binary-merger progenitors of Supernova 1987A (SN 1987A), whose properties are close to those of the blue supergiant Sanduleak -69 202, are exploded by neutrino heating in three-dimensions (3D), and light-curve calculations are performed in spherical symmetry, starting long after shock breakout. Our results confirm basic findings of previous works using single-star progenitors: (1) 3D neutrino-driven explosions with SN 1987A-like energies synthesize an amount of Ni-56 that is consistent with the radioactive tail of the light curve; (2) hydrodynamic models mix hydrogen inward to minimum velocities below 40 km/s as required by spectral observations of SN 1987A; and (3) for given explosion energy the efficiency of outward radioactive Ni-56 mixing depends mainly on high growth factors of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the (C+O)/He and He/H composition interfaces and a weak interaction of fast plumes with the reverse shock occurring below the He/H interface. All binary-merger models possess presupernova radii consistent with the photometric radius of Sanduleak -69 202 and a structure of the outer layers allowing them to reproduce the observed initial luminosity peak in the first about 7 days. The light curve shape of models that mix about 0.5 Msun of hydrogen into the helium shell and that exhibit strong outward mixing of Ni-56 with maximum velocities exceeding the 3000 km/s observed for the bulk of ejected Ni-56 is in very good agreement with the dome of the SN 1987A light curve. A comparative analysis of light-curve models of SN 1987A based on 3D neutrino-driven explosions of single-star and binary-merger progenitors shows that only one binary model matches all observational constraints with one exception.

title: Accretion onto a small black hole at the center of a neutron star
authors: Chloe B. Richards, Thomas W. Baumgarte, Stuart L. Shapiro
topic: We revisit the system consisting of a neutron star that harbors a small, possibly primordial, black hole at its center, focusing on a nonspinning black hole embedded in a nonrotating neutron star. Extending earlier treatments, we provide an analytical treatment describing the rate of secular accretion of the neutron star matter onto the black hole, adopting the relativistic Bondi accretion formalism for stiff equations of state that we presented elsewhere. We use these accretion rates to sketch the evolution of the system analytically until the neutron star is completely consumed. We also perform numerical simulations in full general relativity for black holes with masses up to nine orders of magnitude smaller than the neutron star mass, including a simulation of the entire evolution through collapse for the largest black hole mass. We construct relativistic initial data for these simulations by generalizing the black hole puncture method to allow for the presence of matter, and evolve these data with a code that is optimally designed to resolve the vastly different length scales present in this problem.

title: Electron Spectrum for the Prompt Emission of Gamma-ray Bursts in the Synchrotron Radiation Scenario
authors: Kuan Liu, Da-Bin Lin, Jing Li, Yu-Fei Li, Rui-Jing Lu, En-Wei Liang
topic: Growing evidence indicates that the synchrotron radiation mechanism may be responsible for the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In the synchrotron radiation scenario, the electron energy spectrum of the prompt emission is diverse in theoretical works and has not been estimated from observations in a general way (i.e., without specifying a certain physical model for the electron spectrum). In this paper, we creatively propose a method to directly estimate the electron spectrum for the prompt emission, without specifying a certain physical model for the electron spectrum in the synchrotron radiation scenario. In this method, an empirical function (i.e., a four-order Bezier curve jointed with a linear function at high-energy) is applied to describe the electron spectrum in log-log coordinate. It is found that our empirical function can well mimic the electron spectra obtained in many numerical calculations or simulations. Then, our method can figure out the electron spectrum for the prompt emission without specifying a model. By employing our method on observations, taking GRB 180720B and GRB 160509A as examples, it is found that the obtained electron spectra are generally different from that in the standard fast-cooling scenario and even a broken power law. Moreover, the morphology of electron spectra in its low-energy regime varies with time in a burst and even in a pulse. Our proposed method provides a valuable way to confront the synchrotron radiation mechanism with observations.

topic: GW190814 was a compact object binary coalescence detected in gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo that garnered exceptional community interest due to its excellent localization and the uncertain nature of the binary's lighter-mass component (either the heaviest known neutron star, or the lightest known black hole). Despite extensive follow up observations, no electromagnetic counterpart has been identified. Here we present new radio observations of 75 galaxies within the localization volume at delta t=35-266 days post-merger. Our observations cover ~32% of the total stellar luminosity in the final localization volume and extend to later timescales than previously-reported searches, allowing us to place the deepest constraints to date on the existence of a radio afterglow from a highly off-axis relativistic jet launched during the merger (assuming that the merger occurred within the observed area). For a viewing angle of ~46deg (the best-fit binary inclination derived from the gravitational wave signal) and assumed electron and magnetic field energy fractions of, we can rule out a typical short gamma-ray burst-like Gaussian jet with isotropic-equivalent kinetic energy 2×1051 erg propagating into a constant density medium n\geq 0.01 cm-3. These are the first limits resulting from a galaxy-targeted search for a radio counterpart to a gravitational wave event, and we discuss the challenges, and possible advantages, of applying similar search strategies to future events using current and upcoming radio facilities.

title: Extension of the Advanced Spectral Leakage scheme for neutron star merger simulations
authors: Davide Gizzi, Christoffer Lundman, Evan O'Connor, Stephan Rosswog, Albino Perego
topic: We extend a neutrino transport approximation, called Advanced Spectral Leakage (ASL), with the purpose of modeling neutrino-driven winds in neutron star mergers. Based on a number of snapshots we gauge the ASL parameters by comparing against both the two-moment (M1) scheme implemented in the FLASH code and the Monte Carlo neutrino code Sedonu. The ASL scheme contains three parameters, the least robust of which results to be a blocking parameter for electron neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. The parameter steering the angular distribution of neutrino heating is re-calibrated compared to the earlier work (arXiv:1906.11494). We also present a new, fast and mesh-free algorithm for calculating spectral optical depths, which, when using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), makes the neutrino transport completely particle-based. We estimate a speed-up of a factor of \geq 100 in the optical depth calculation when comparing to a grid-based approach. In the suggested calibration we recover luminosities and mean energies within 25%. A comparison of the rates of change of internal energy and electron fraction in the neutrino-driven wind suggests comparable accuracies of ASL and M1, but a higher computational efficiency of the ASL scheme. We estimate that the ratio between the CPU hours spent on the ASL neutrino scheme and those spent on the hydrodynamics is \leq 0.8 per timestep when considering MAGMA2 (arXiv:1911.13093) as source code for the Lagrangian hydrodynamics, to be compared with a factor of 10 from the M1 in FLASH.

title: The intermediate neutron capture process. I. Development of the i-process in low-metallicity low-mass AGB stars
authors: A. Choplin, L. Siess, S. Goriely
topic: Gathering observations report a growing number of metal-poor stars showing an abundance pattern midway between the s- and r-processes. These so called r/s-stars raise the need for an intermediate neutron capture process (i-process), which is thought to result from the ingestion of protons in a convective helium-burning region, but whose astrophysical site is still largely debated. We investigate whether an i-process during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of low-metallicity low-mass stars can develop and whether it can explain the abundances of observed r/s-stars. At the beginning of the AGB phase, during the third thermal pulse, the helium driven convection zone is able to penetrate in the hydrogen rich layers. The subsequent proton ingestion leads to a strong neutron burst with neutron densities of 4.3×1014 cm−3 at the origin of the synthesis of i-process elements. The nuclear energy released by proton burning in the helium-burning convective shell strongly affects the internal structure: the thermal pulse splits and after ≈10 yr the upper part of the convection zone merges with the convective envelope. The surface carbon abundance is enhanced by more than 3 dex, leading to an increase of the opacity which triggers a strong mass loss and prevents any further thermal pulse. We show that specific isotopic ratios of Ba, Nd, Sm and Eu can represent good tracers of i-process nucleosynthesis. Finally, an extended comparison with 14 selected r/s-stars show that the observed composition patterns can be well reproduced by our i-process AGB model. However, such AGB models cannot account for the high level of enrichment of the giant r/s-stars in a scenario involving pollution by a former AGB companion.

title: Smoothed Particle Radiation Hydrodynamics: Two-Moment method with Local Eddington Tensor Closure
authors: T. K. Chan, Tom Theuns, Richard Bower, Carlos Frenk
topic: We present a new radiative transfer method (SPH-M1RT) that is coupled dynamically with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We implement it in the (tasked-based parallel) SWIFT galaxy simulation code but it can be straightforwardly implemented to other SPH codes. Our moment-based method simultaneously solves the radiation energy and flux equations in SPH, making it adaptive in space and time. We modify the M1 closure relation to stabilize radiation fronts in the optically thin limit which performs well even in the case of head-on beam collisions. We also introduce anisotropic artificial viscosity and high-order artificial diffusion schemes, which allow the code to handle radiation transport accurately in both the optically thin and optically thick regimes. Non-equilibrium thermochemistry is solved using a semi-implicit subcycling technique. The computational cost of our method is independent of the number of sources and can be lowered using the reduced speed of light approximation. We demonstrate the robustness of our method by applying it to a set of standard tests from the cosmological radiative transfer comparison project of Iliev et al. The SPH-M1RT scheme is well-suited for modelling situations in which numerous sources emit ionising radiation, such as cosmological simulations of galaxy formation or simulations of the interstellar medium.

title: Extreme r-process enhanced stars at high metallicity in Fornax
authors: M. Reichert, C. J. Hansen, A. Arcones
topic: We present and discuss three extremely rapid neutron-capture (r-)process enhanced stars located in the massive dwarf spheriodal galaxy Fornax. These stars are very unique with an extreme Eu enrichment at high metallicities. They have the largest Eu abundances ever observed in a dwarf galaxy opening new opportunities to further understand the origin of heavy elements formed by the r-process. We derive stellar abundances of Co, Zr, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Er, and Lu using 1-dimensional, local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) codes and model atmospheres in conjunction with state-of-the art yield predictions. We derive Zr in the largest sample of stars (105) known to date in a dwarf galaxy. Accurate stellar abundances combined with a careful assessment of the yield predictions have revealed three metal-rich stars in Fornax showing a pure r-process pattern. We define a new class of stars, namely Eu-stars, as r-II stars (i.e., [Eu/Fe]>1) at high metallicities (i.e., [Fe/H]geq-1.5). The stellar abundance pattern contains Lu, observed for the first time in a dwarf galaxy, and reveals that a late burst of star formation has facilitated extreme r-process enhancement late in the galaxy's history (4 Gyr ago). Owing to the large uncertainties associated with nuclear physics input in the yield predictions, we cannot yet determine the r-process site leading to the three Eu-stars in Fornax. Our results demonstrate that extremely r-rich stars are not only associated to ultra faint low-mass dwarf galaxies, but can be born also in massive dwarf galaxies.

title: Neutrino absorption and other physics dependencies in neutrino-cooled black-hole accretion disks
authors: Oliver Just (1,2), Stephane Goriely (3), Hans-Thomas Janka (4), Shigehiro Nagataki (2,5), Andreas Bauswein
topic: Black-hole (BH) accretion disks formed in compact-object mergers or collapsars may be major sites of the rapid-neutron-capture (r-)process, but the conditions determining the electron fraction (Ye) remain uncertain given the complexity of neutrino transfer and angular-momentum transport. After discussing relevant weak-interaction regimes, we study the role of neutrino absorption for shaping Ye using an extensive set of simulations performed with two-moment neutrino transport and again without neutrino absorption. We vary the torus mass, BH mass and spin, and examine the impact of rest-mass and weak-magnetism corrections in the neutrino rates. We also test the dependence on the angular-momentum transport treatment by comparing axisymmetric models using the standard alpha-viscosity with viscous models assuming constant viscous length scales (lt) and three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Finally, we discuss the nucleosynthesis yields and basic kilonova properties. We find that absorption pushes Ye towards ~0.5 outside the torus, while inside increasing the equilibrium value Ye^eq by -0.05--0.2. Correspondingly, a substantial ejecta fraction is pushed above Ye=0.25, leading to a reduced lanthanide fraction and a brighter, earlier, and bluer kilonova than without absorption. More compact tori with higher neutrino optical depth, tau, tend to have lower Ye^eq up to tau~1-10, above which absorption becomes strong enough to reverse this trend. Disk ejecta are less (more) neutron-rich when employing an lt=const. viscosity (MHD treatment). The solar-like abundance pattern found for our MHD model marginally supports collapsar disks as major r-process sites, although a strong r-process may be limited to phases of high mass-infall rates, Mdot>~ 2 x 10^(-2) Msun/s.

title: Matter density distribution of general relativistic highly magnetized jets driven by black holes
authors: Taiki Ogihara, Takumi Ogawa, Kenji Toma
topic: High-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) radio observations have resolved the detailed emission structures of active galactic nucleus jets. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations have improved the understanding of jet production physics, although theoretical studies still have difficulties in constraining the origin and distribution of jetted matter. We construct a new steady, axisymmetric GRMHD jet model to obtain approximate solutions of black hole (BH) magnetospheres, and examine the matter density distribution of jets. By assuming fixed poloidal magnetic field shapes that mimic force-free analytic solutions and GRMHD simulation results and assuming constant poloidal velocity at the separation surface, which divides the inflow and outflow, we numerically solve the force-balance between the field lines at the separation surface and analytically solve the distributions of matter velocity and density along the field lines. We find that the densities at the separation surface in our parabolic field models roughly follow in the far zone from the BH, where rss is the radius of the separation surface. When the BH spin is larger or the velocity at the separation surface is smaller, the density at the separation surface becomes concentrated more near the jet edge. Our semi-analytic model, combined with radiative transfer calculations, may help interpret the high-resolution VLBI observations and understand the origin of jetted matter.

title: Nebular Emission from Lanthanide-rich Ejecta of Neutron Star Merger
authors: Kenta Hotokezaka, Masaomi Tanaka, Daiji Kato, Gediminas Gaigalas
topic: The nebular phase of lanthanide-rich ejecta of a neutron star merger (NSM) is studied by using a one-zone model, in which the atomic properties are represented by a single species, neodymium (Nd). Under the assumption that beta-decay of r-process nuclei is the heat and ionization source, we solve the ionization and thermal balance of the ejecta under non-local thermodynamic equilibrium. The atomic data including energy levels, radiative transition rates, collision strengths, and recombination rate coefficients, are obtained by using atomic structure codes, GRASP2K and HULLAC. We find that both permitted and forbidden lines roughly equally contribute to the cooling rate of Nd II and Nd III at the nebular temperatures. We show that the kinetic temperature and ionization degree increase with time in the early stage of the nebular phase while these quantities become approximately independent of time after the thermalization break of the heating rate because the processes relevant to the ionization and thermalization balance are attributed to two-body collision between electrons and ions at later times. As a result, in spite of the rapid decline of the luminosity, the shape of the emergent spectrum does not change significantly with time after the break. We show that the emission-line nebular spectrum of the pure Nd ejecta consists of a broad structure from 0.5μm to 20μm with two distinct peaks around 1μm and 10μm.

title: Thermal evolution of relativistic hyperonic compact stars with calibrated equations of state
authors: Morgane Fortin, Adriana R. Raduta, Sidney Avancini, Constanca Providencia
topic: A set of unified relativistic mean-field equations of state for hyperonic compact stars recently built in is used to study the thermal evolution of non-magnetized and non-rotating spherically-symmetric isolated and accreting neutron stars under different hypothesis concerning proton S-wave superfluidity.
These equations of state have been obtained in the following way: the slope of the symmetry energy is in agreement with experimental data; the coupling constants of Lambda and Zetta-hyperons are determined from experimental hypernuclear data; uncertainties in the nucleon-Sigma interaction potential are accounted for; current constraints on the lower bound of the maximum neutron star mass are satisfied.
Within the considered set of equations of state, the presence of hyperons is essential for the description of the cooling/heating curves.
One of the conclusions we reach is that the criterion of best agreement with observational data leads to different equations of states and proton S-wave superfluidity gaps when applied separately for isolated neutron stars and accreting neutron stars in quiescence.

title: Fully general-relativistic simulations of isolated and binary strange quark stars
authors: Zhenyu Zhu, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: The hypothesis that strange quark matter is the true ground state of matter has been investigated for almost four decades, but only a few works have explored the dynamics of binary systems of quark stars. This is partly due to the numerical challenges that need to be faced when modelling the large discontinuities at the surface of these stars. We here present a novel technique in which the EOS of a quark star is suitably rescaled to produce a smooth change of the specific enthalpy across a very thin crust. The introduction of the crust has been carefully tested by considering the oscillation properties of isolated quark stars, showing that the response of the simulated quark stars matches accurately the perturbative predictions. Using this technique, we have carried out the first fully general-relativistic simulations of the merger of quark-star binaries finding several important differences between quark-star binaries and hadronic-star binaries with the same mass and comparable tidal deformability. In particular, we find that dynamical mass loss is significantly suppressed in quark-star binaries. In addition, quark-star binaries have merger and post-merger frequencies that obey the same quasi-universal relations derived from hadron stars if expressed in terms of the tidal deformability, but not when expressed in terms of the average stellar compactness. Hence, it may be difficult to distinguish the two classes of stars if no information on the stellar radius is available. Finally, differences are found in the distributions in velocity and entropy of the ejected matter, for which quark-stars have much smaller tails. Whether these differences in the ejected matter will leave an imprint in the electromagnetic counterpart and nucleosynthetic yields remains unclear, calling for the construction of an accurate model for the evaporation of the ejected quarks into nucleons.

title: Energy Conservation in the thin layer approximation: IV. The light curve for supernovae
authors: Lorenzo Zaninetti
topic: The light curves (LC) for Supernova (SN) can be modeled adopting the conversion of the flux of kinetic energy into radiation. This conversion requires an analytical or a numerical law of motion for the expanding radius of the SN. In the framework of conservation of energy for the thin layer approximation we present a classical trajectory based on a power law profile for the density, a relativistic trajectory based on the Navarro--Frenk--White profile for the density, and a relativistic trajectory based on a power law behaviour for the swept mass. A detailed simulation of the LC requires the evaluation of the optical depth as a function of time. We modeled the LC of SN~1993J in different astronomical bands, the LC of GRB 050814 and the LC GRB 060729 in the keV region. The time dependence of the magnetic field of equipartition is derived from the theoretical formula for the luminosity.

title: Revisiting the Strong Shock Problem: Converging and Diverging Shocks in Different Geometries
authors: Elisha Modelevsky, Re'em Sari
topic: Self-similar solutions to converging (implosions) and diverging (explosions) shocks have been studied before, in planar, cylindrical or spherical symmetry. Here we offer a unified treatment of these apparently disconnected problems . We study the flow of an ideal gas with adiabatic index gamma with initial density rho-r omega, containing a strong shock wave. We characterize the self-similar solutions in the entirety of the parameter space gamma-omega, and draw the connections between the different geometries. We find that the so-called "gap" in diverging shocks does not exist in planar geometry, and that only type II self-similar solutions are valid in converging shocks. We also find that in some cases, a converging shock might not create a reflected shock after its convergence. Finally, we derive analytical approximations for the similarity exponent in the entirety of parameter space.

title: General Relativistic Neutrino-Driven Turbulence in One-Dimensional Core-Collapse Supernovae
authors: Luca Boccioli, Grant J. Mathews, Evan O'Connor
topic: Convection and turbulence in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are inherently three-dimensional in nature. However, 3D simulations of CCSNe are computationally demanding. Thus, it is valuable to modify simulations in spherical symmetry to incorporate 3D effects using some parametric model. In this paper, we report on the formulation and implementation of general relativistic (GR) neutrino-driven turbulent convection in the spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova code \texttt{GR1D}. This is based upon the recently proposed method of Supernova Turbulence in Reduced-dimensionality (\textit{STIR}) in Newtonian simulations from \cite{Couch2020_STIR}. When the parameters of this model are calibrated to 3D simulations, we find that our GR formulation of \textit{STIR} requires larger turbulent eddies to achieve a shock evolution similar to the original \textit{STIR} model. We also find that general relativity may alter the correspondence between progenitor mass and successful vs.~failed explosions.

title: Minidisk dynamics in accreting, spinning black hole binaries: Simulations in full general relativity
authors: Vasileios Paschalidis, Milton Ruiz, Milton Ruiz, Roman Gold
topic: We perform magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accreting, equal-mass binary black holes in full general relativity focusing on the impact of black hole spin on the dynamical formation and evolution of minidisks. We find that during the late inspiral the sizes of minidisks are primarily determined by the interplay between the tidal field and the effective innermost stable orbit around each black hole. Our calculations support that a minidisk forms when the Hill sphere around each black hole is significantly larger than the black hole's effective innermost stable orbit. As the binary inspirals, the radius of the Hill sphere decreases, and minidisk sconsequently shrink in size. As a result, electromagnetic signatures associated with minidisks may be expected to gradually disappear prior to merger when there are no more stable orbits within the Hill sphere. In particular, a gradual disappearance of a hard electromagnetic component in the spectrum of such systems could provide a characteristic signature of merging black hole binaries. For a binary of given total mass, the timescale to minidisk "evaporation" should therefore depend on the black hole spins and the mass ratio. We also demonstrate that accreting binary black holes with spin have a higher efficiency for converting accretion power to jet luminosity. These results could provide new ways to estimate black hole spins in the future.

title: Probing the nature of central objects in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals with gravitational waves
authors: Sayak Datta, Sukanta Bose
topic: We extend the work of Ryan on mapping the spacetime of the central object of an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) by using gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by the system, which may be observed in future missions such as LISA. Whether the central object is a black hole or not can be probed by observing the phasing of these waves, which carry information about its mass and spin multipole moments. We go beyond the phase terms found by Ryan, which were obtained in the quadrupolar approximation of the point-particle limit, and derive terms up to the fifth post-Newtonian (PN) order. Since corrections due to horizon absorption (i.e., if the central object is a black hole) and tidal heating appear by that order, at 2.5PN and 5PN, respectively, we include them here. Corrections due to the motion of the central object, which was addressed only partially by Ryan, are included as well. Additionally, we obtain the contribution of the higher order radiative multipole moments. For the tidal interaction, our results have been derived in the approximation of the Newtonian tidal field. Therefore, in the potential for tidal field only the contribution due to the mass of the central object has been included as well. Using these results we argue that it might be possible for LISA to probe if the central object in an EMRI has a horizon or not. We also discuss how our results can be used to test the No-hair theorem from the inspiral phase of such systems.

title: What can be learned from a proto-neutron star's mass and radius?
authors: Edwan Preau (APC, LUTH), Aurélien Pascal (LUTH), Jérôme Novak (LUTH), Micaela Oertel (LUTH)
topic: We make extensive numerical studies of masses and radii of proto-neutron stars during the first second after their birth in core-collapse supernova events. We use a quasi-static approach for the computation of proto-neutron star structure, built on parameterized entropy and electron fraction profiles, that are then evolved with neutrino cooling processes. We vary the equation of state of nuclear matter, the proto-neutron star mass and the parameters of the initial profiles, to take into account our ignorance of the supernova progenitor properties. We show that if masses and radii of a proto-neutron star can be determined in the first second after the birth, e.g. from gravitational wave emission, no information could be obtained on the corresponding cold neutron star and therefore on the cold nuclear equation of state. Similarly, it seems unlikely that any property of the proto-neutron star equation of state (hot and not beta-equilibrated) could be determined either, mostly due to the lack of information on the entropy, or equivalently temperature, distribution in such objects.

Although the r-process in each of these sites can lead to similar (or differing) isotopic abundances, our simulations reveal that the early contribution of r-process material to the Galaxy was dominated by CCSNe and collapsar r-process nucleosynthesis, while the NSM contribution is unavoidably delayed even under the assumption of the shortest possible minimum merger time.

title: Powerful Jets from Radiatively Efficient Disks, a Decades-Old Unresolved Problem in High Energy Astrophysics
authors: Chandra B. Singh, David Garofalo, Benjamin Lang
topic: The discovery of 3C 273 in 1963, and the emergence of the Kerr solution shortly thereafter, precipitated the current era in astrophysics focused on using black holes to explain active galactic nuclei (AGN). But while partial success was achieved in separately explaining the bright nuclei of some AGN via thin disks, as well as powerful jets with thick disks, the combination of both powerful jets in an AGN with a bright nucleus, such as in 3C 273, remained elusive. Although numerical simulations have taken center stage in the last 25 years, they have struggled to produce the conditions that explain them. This is because radiatively efficient disks have proved a challenge to simulate. Radio quasars have thus been the least understood objects in high energy astrophysics. But recent simulations have begun to change this. We explore this milestone in light of scale-invariance and show that transitory jets, possibly related to the jets seen in these recent simulations, as some have proposed, cannot explain radio quasars. We then provide a road map for a resolution.

title: Radiative Shocks around Super-Eddington Accreting Black Holes
authors: Toru Okuda, Chandra B. Singh
topic: We examine radiative standing shocks in advective accretion flows around stellar-mass black holes by 2D radiation hydrodynamic simulations, focusing on the super-Eddington accreting flow. Under a set of input flow parameters responsible for the standing shock, the shock location on the equator decreases toward the event horizon with an increasing accretion rate. The optically thin and hot gas in the narrow funnel region along the rotational axis changes gradually into a dense and optically thick state with the increasingly dense gas transported from the base of the radiative shock near the equator. As a result, the luminosity becomes as high as ~ 1040 erg s-1, and the radiation shows a strongly anisotropic distribution around the rotational axis and then very low edge-on luminosity as ~ 1036 erg s-1. The mass outflow rate from the outer boundary is high as ~ 10-5 and 10-4 Msun yr-1 but most of the outflow is originated through the radial outer boundary and may be observed over a wide wind region. The models show approximately black body spectra with a temperature of 5x106−3x107 K at the vertical outer boundary surface. The radiative shock models with the super-Eddington luminosities show a possible model for the superaccretor SS 433 and Ultraluminous X-ray sources with stellar-mass black holes.

title: Dissecting Energy Budget of a Gamma-Ray Burst Fireball
authors: Bing Zhang, Yu Wang, Liang Li
topic: The jet composition and radiative efficiency of GRBs are poorly constrained from the data. If the jet composition is matter-dominated (i.e. a fireball), the GRB prompt emission spectra would include a dominant thermal component originating from the fireball photosphere, and a non-thermal component presumably originating from internal shocks whose radii are greater than the photosphere radius. We propose a method to directly dissect the GRB fireball energy budget into three components and measure their values by combining the prompt emission and early afterglow data. The measured parameters include the initial dimensionless specific enthalpy density, bulk Lorentz factors at the photosphere radius  and before fireball deceleration, the amount of mass loading, as well as the GRB radiative efficiency. All the parameters can be derived from the data for a GRB with a dominant thermal spectral component, a deceleration bump feature in the early afterglow lightcurve, and a measured redshift. The results only weakly depend on the density n of the interstellar medium when the composition Y parameter (typically unity) is specified.

title: Nucleosynthesis signatures of neutrino-driven winds from proto-neutron stars: a perspective from chemical evolution models
authors: Fiorenzo Vincenzo, Todd A. Thompson, David H. Weinberg, Emily J. Griffith, James W. Johnson, Jennifer A. Johnson
topic: We test the hypothesis that the observed first-peak (Sr, Y, Zr) and second-peak (Ba) s-process elemental abundances in low metallicity Milky Way stars ([Fe/H]less-0.5), and the abundances of the intervening elements Mo and Ru, can be explained by a pervasive r-process contribution that originates in neutrino-driven winds from highly-magnetic and rapidly rotating proto-neutron stars (proto-NSs). To this end, we construct chemical evolution models that incorporate recent calculations of proto-NS yields in addition to contributions from AGB stars, Type Ia supernovae, and two alternative sets of yields for massive star winds and core collapse supernovae. For non-rotating massive star yields from either set, models without proto-NS winds underpredict the observed s-process peak abundances by 0.3-1dex at low metallicity, and they severely underpredict Mo and Ru at all metallicities. Models that include the additional wind yields predicted for proto-NSs with spin periods P~2-5ms fit the observed trends for all these elements well. Alternatively, models that omit proto-NS winds but adopt yields of rapidly rotating massive stars, with vrot between 150 and 300kms−1, can explain the observed abundance levels reasonably well for [Fe/H]<−2. These models overpredict [Sr/Fe] and [Mo/Fe] at higher metallicities, but with a tuned dependence of vrot on stellar metallicity they might achieve an acceptable fit at all [Fe/H]. If many proto-NSs are born with strong magnetic fields and short spin periods, then their neutrino-driven winds provide a natural source for Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, and Ba in low metallicity stellar populations. Spherical winds from unmagnetized proto-NSs, on the other hand, overproduce the observed Sr, Y, and Zr abundances by a large factor.

topic: Compact binary mergers that involve at least one neutron star, either binary neutron star or black hole--neutron star coalescences, are thought to be the potential sources of electromagnetic emission due to the material ejected during the merger or those left outside the central object after the merger. Since the intensity of these electromagnetic transients decay rapidly with time, one should pay more attention to early emissions from such events, which are useful in revealing the nature of these mergers. In this work, we study the early emission of kilonovae, short gamma-ray bursts and cocoons that could be produced in those mergers. We estimate their luminosities and time scales as functions of the chirp mass which is the most readily constrained parameter from the gravitational wave detections of these events. We focus on the range of chirp mass as 1.3Msun−2.7Msun which is compatible with one of the merging component being a so-called `mass gap' black hole. We show that the electromagnetic observation of these transients could be used to distinguish the types of the mergers when the detected chirp mass falls in the range of 1.5Msun−1.7Msun. Applying our analysis to the sub-threshold GRB GBM-190816, we found that for this particular event the effective spin should be larger than 0.6 and the mass of the heavier object might be larger than 5.5Msun for the SFHo equation of state.

title: Rotating Neutron stars with Quark cores
authors: Ishfaq A. Rather, Usuf Rahaman, M. Imran, H. C. Das, A. A. Usmani, S. K. Patra
topic: The rotating neutron star properties are studied with a phase transition to quark matter. The density-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DD-RMF) is employed to study the hadron matter, while the Vector-Enhanced Bag model (vBag) model is used to study the quark matter. The star matter properties like mass, radius, the moment of inertia, rotational frequency, Kerr parameter, and other important quantities are studied to see the effect on quark matter. The maximum mass of rotating neutron star with DD-LZ1 and DD-MEX parameter sets is found to be around 3Msun for pure hadronic phase and decreases to a value around 2.6Msun with phase transition to quark matter, which satisfies the recent GW190814 constraints. For DDV, DDVT, and DDVTD parameter sets, the maximum mass decreases to satisfy the 2Msun. The moment of inertia calculated for various DD-RMF parameter sets decreases with the increasing mass satisfying constraints from various measurements. Other important quantities calculated also vary with the bag constant and hence show that the presence of quarks inside neutron stars can also allow us to constraint these quantities to determine a proper EoS. Also, the theoretical study along with the accurate measurement of uniformly rotating neutron star properties may offer some valuable information concerning the high-density part of the equation of state.

title: Quiescent luminosities of accreting neutron stars with different equation of states
authors: Helei Liu, Akira Dohi, Masa-aki Hashimoto, Yasuhide Matsuo, Guo-Liang Lü, Tsuneo Noda
topic: We model the quiescent luminosity of accreting neutron stars with several equation of states (EOSs), including the effect of pion condensation and superfluidity. As a consequence of comparison with the observations, we show that the results with Togashi EoS (the strong direct Urca process is forbidden) and TM1e EoS (mass at direct Urca process is 2.06Msun) can explain the observations well by considering pion condensation and the effect of superfluidity, while LS220 EoS and TM1 EoS can explain the observations well by considering the baryon direct Urca process and the effect of superfluidity. Besides, we compare the results with the observations of a neutron star RX J0812.4-3114 which has the low average mass accretion rate but high thermal luminosity, and we suggest that a low-mass neutron star (less 1Msun) with minimum cooling can explain the lower limit of the observation of thermal luminosity of RX J0812.4-3114, which is qualitatively consistent with the previous work. However, to explain its upper limit, some other heating mechanisms besides standard deep crustal heating may be needed.

title: Isochronic evolution and the radioactive decay of r-process nuclei
authors: T. M. Sprouse, G. Wendell Misch, M. R. Mumpower
topic: We report on the creation and application of a novel decay network that uses the latest data from experiment and evaluation. We use the network to simulate the late-time phase of the rapid neutron capture (r) process. In this epoch, the bulk of nuclear reactions, such as radiative capture, have ceased and nuclear decays are the dominant transmutation channels. We find that the decay from short-lived to long-lived species naturally leads to an isochronic evolution in which nuclei with similar half-lives are populated at the same time. We consider random perturbations along each isobaric chain to initial solar-like r-process compositions to demonstrate the isochronic nature of the late-time phase of the r-process. Our analysis shows that detailed knowledge of the final isotopic composition allows for the prediction of late-time evolution with a high degree of confidence despite uncertainties that exist in astrophysical conditions and the nuclear physics properties of the most neutron-rich nuclei. We provide the time-dependent nuclear composition in the Appendix as supplemental material.

title: Evidence for r-process delay in very metal-poor stars
authors: Yuta Tarumi, Kenta Hotokezaka, Paz Beniamini
topic: The abundances of r-process elements of very metal-poor stars capture the history of the r-process enrichment in the early stage of the Milky Way formation. Currently, various types of astrophysical sites including neutron star mergers, magneto-rotational supernovae, and collapsars, are suggested as the origin of r-process elements. The time delay between the star formation and the production of r-process elements is the key to distinguish these scenarios with the caveat that the diffusion of r-process elements in the interstellar medium also induces the delay in r-process enrichment because r-process events are rare. Here we study the observed Ba abundance data of very metal-poor stars as the tracer of the early enrichment history of r-process elements. We find that the gradual increase of [Ba/Mg] with [Fe/H] requires a significant time delay (100 Myr -- 1 Gyr) of r-process events from star formation rather than the diffusion-induced delay. We stress that this conclusion is robust to the assumption regarding s-process contamination in the Ba abundances because the sources with no delay would overproduce Ba at very low metallicities even without the contribution from the s-process. Therefore we conclude that sources with a delay, possibly neutron star mergers, are the origins of r-process elements.

title: Multimessenger Binary Mergers Containing Neutron Stars: Gravitational Waves, Jets, and 
authors: Milton Ruiz, Stuart L. Shapiro, Antonios Tsokaros
topic: Neutron stars (NSs) are extraordinary not only because they are the densest form of matter in the visible Universe but also because they can generate B-fields ten orders of magnitude larger than those currently constructed on Earth. The combination of extreme gravity with the enormous electromagnetic (EM) fields gives rise to spectacular phenomena like those observed on August 2017 with the merger of a binary neutron star (NSNS) system, an event that generated a gravitational wave (GW) signal, a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB), and a kilonova. This event serves as the highlight so far of the era of multimessenger astronomy. In this review, we present the current state of our theoretical understanding of compact binary mergers containing NSs as gleaned from the latest general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Such mergers can lead to events like the one on August 2017, GW170817, and its EM counterparts, GRB 170817 and AT 2017gfo. In addition to exploring the GW emission from binary black hole-neutron star and NSNS mergers, we also focus on their counterpart EM signals. In particular, we are interested in identifying the conditions under which a relativistic jet can be launched following these mergers. Such a jet is an essential feature of most sGRB models and provides the main conduit of energy from the central object to the outer radiation regions. Jet properties, including their lifetimes and Poynting luminosities, the effects of the initial B-field geometries and spins of the coalescing NSs, as well as their governing equation of state, are discussed. Lastly, we present our current understanding of how the Blandford-Znajek mechanism arises from merger remnants as the trigger for launching jets, if, when and how a horizon is necessary for this mechanism, and the possibility that it can turn on in magnetized neutron ergostars, which contain ergoregions, but no horizons.

title: Dynamical formation of the GW190814 merger
authors: Manuel Arca Sedda
topic: We investigate the possible dynamical origin of GW190814, a gravitational wave (GW) source discovered by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration (LVC) associated with a merger between a stellar black hole (BH) with mass 23.2 Msun and a compact object, either a BH or a neutron star (NS), with mass 2.59 Msun. Using a database of 240,000 N-body simulations modelling the formation of NS-BH mergers via dynamical encounters in dense clusters, we find that systems like GW190814 are likely to form in young, metal-rich clusters. Our model suggests that a little excess (~2-4%) of objects with masses in the range 2.3-3 Msun in the compact remnants mass spectrum leads to a detection rate for dynamically formed "GW190814 -like" mergers of ΓGW190814=1-6 yr Gpc-3, i.e. within the observational constraints set by the GW190814 discovery. Additionally, our model suggests that ~1.8-4.8% of dynamical NS-BH mergers are compatible with GW190426 152155, the only confirmed NS-BH merger detected by the LVC. We show that the relative amount of light and heavy NS-BH mergers can provide clues about the environments in which they developed.

title: Numerical simulation of hot accretion flows (IV): effects of black hole spin and magnetic field strength on the wind and the comparison between wind and jet properties
authors: Hai Yang (SHAO), Feng Yuan (SHAO), Ye-fei Yuan (USTC), Christopher J. White (Princeton)
topic: This is the fourth paper of our series of works studying winds from hot accretion flows around black holes. In the first two papers, we have shown the existence of strong winds in hot accretion flows using hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations. In the third paper, by using three dimensional general relativity MHD numerical simulation data of hot accretion flows and adopting a "virtual particle trajectory" data analysis approach, we have calculated the properties of wind, such as its mass flux and velocity. However, that paper focuses only on a non-spinning black hole and SANE (standard and normal accretion). In the present paper, we extend the third paper by including cases of a rapidly rotating black hole and MAD (magnetically arrested disk). We focus on investigating the effect of spin and magnetic field on the properties of wind and jet. It is found that a larger spin and stronger magnetic field usually enhance the wind and jet. The formulae describing the mass flux, poloidal velocity, and fluxes of momentum, kinetic energy, and total energy of wind and jet are presented. One interesting finding, among others, is that even in the case of very rapidly spinning black hole where the jet is supposed to be the strongest, the momentum flux of jet is smaller than that of wind, while the total energy flux of jet is larger than that of wind by at most a factor of 10. The implications of this result to the importance of wind relative to jet in active galactic nuclei feedback are discussed.

title: Exact solution of one dimensional relativistic jet with relativistic equation of state
authors: Raj Kishor Joshi, Indranil Chattopadhyay, Dongsu Ryu, Lallan Yadav
topic: We study the evolution of one-dimensional relativistic jets, using the exact solution of the Riemann problem for relativistic flows. For this purpose, we solve equations for the ideal special relativistic fluid composed of dissimilar particles in flat space-time and the thermodynamics of fluid is governed by a relativistic equation of state. We obtain the exact solution of jets impinging on denser ambient media. The time variation of the cross-section of the jet-head is modeled and incorporated. We present the initial condition that gives rise to a reverse shock. If the jet-head cross-section increases in time, the jet propagation speed slows down significantly and the reverse-shock may recede opposite to the propagation direction of the jet. We show that the composition of jet and ambient medium can affect the jet solution significantly. For instance, the propagation speed depends on the composition and is maximum for a pair-dominated jet, rather than a pure electron-positron or electron-proton jet. The propagation direction of the reverse-shock may also strongly depend on the composition of the jet.

title: A marginally fast-cooling proton-synchrotron model for prompt GRBs
authors: Ioulia Florou, Maria Petropoulou, Apostolos Mastichiadis
topic: A small fraction of GRBs with available data down to soft X-rays (~0.5 keV) have been shown to feature a spectral break in the low-energy part (~1−10 keV) of their prompt emission spectrum. The overall spectral shape is consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission from a population of particles that have cooled on a timescale comparable to the dynamic time to energies that are still much higher than their rest mass energy (marginally fast cooling regime). We consider a hadronic scenario and investigate if the prompt emission of these GRBs can originate from relativistic protons that radiate synchrotron in the marginally fast cooling regime. Using semi-analytical methods, we derive the source parameters, such as magnetic field strength and proton luminosity, and calculate the high-energy neutrino emission expected in this scenario. We also investigate how the emission of secondary pairs produced by photopion interactions and gamma-gamma pair production affect the broadband photon spectrum. We support our findings with detailed numerical calculations. Strong modification of the photon spectrum below the break energy due to the synchrotron emission of secondary pairs is found, unless the bulk Lorentz factor is very large (Gamma \g 103). Moreover, this scenario predicts unreasonably high Poynting luminosities because of the strong magnetic fields (106−107 G) that are necessary for the incomplete proton cooling. Our results strongly disfavor marginally fast cooling protons as an explanation of the low-energy spectral break in the prompt GRB spectra.

title: Tight multi-messenger constraints on the neutron star equation of state from GW170817 and a forward model for kilonova light curve synthesis
authors: Matt Nicholl, Ben Margalit, Patricia Schmidt, Graham P. Smith, Evan J. Ridley, James Nuttall
topic: We present a rapid analytic framework for predicting kilonova light curves following neutron star (NS) mergers, where the main input parameters are binary-based properties measurable by gravitational wave detectors (chirp mass and mass ratio, orbital inclination) and properties dependent on the nuclear equation of state (tidal deformability, maximum NS mass). This enables synthesis of a kilonova sample for any NS source population, or determination of the observing depth needed to detect a live kilonova given gravitational wave source parameters in low latency. We validate this code, implemented in the public MOSFiT package, by fitting it to GW170817. A Bayes factor analysis overwhelmingly (B>1010) favours the inclusion of an additional luminosity source during the first day, well fit by a shock-heated cocoon, alongside lanthanide-poor dynamical ejecta. The emission thereafter is dominated by a lanthanide-rich viscous wind. We find the mass ratio of the binary is q=0.92+-0.07 (90% credible interval). We place tight constraints on the maximum stable NS mass, MTOV=2.17+0.08-0.11 Msun. For a uniform prior in tidal deformability, the radius of a 1.4 Msun NS is R1.4~10.7 km. Re-weighting with a prior based on equations of state that support our credible range in MTOV, we derive a final measurement R1.4=11.06+1.01-0.98 km. Applying our code to the second gravitationally-detected neutron star merger, GW190425, we estimate that an associated kilonova would have been fainter (by ~0.7 mag at one day post-merger) and declined faster than GW170817, underlining the importance of tuning follow-up strategies individually for each GW-detected NS merger.

title: An Implicit Finite Volume Scheme to Solve the Time Dependent Radiation Transport Equation Based on Discrete Ordinates
authors: Yan-Fei Jiang
topic: We describe a new algorithm to solve the time dependent, frequency integrated radiation transport (RT) equation implicitly, which is coupled to an explicit solver for equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) using {\sf Athena++}. The radiation filed is represented by specific intensities along discrete rays, which are evolved using a conservative finite volume approach for both cartesian and curvilinear coordinate systems. All the terms for spatial transport of photons and interactions between gas and radiation are calculated implicitly together. An efficient Jacobi-like iteration scheme is used to solve the implicit equations. This removes any time step constrain due to the speed of light in RT. We evolve the specific intensities in the lab frame to simplify the transport step. The lab-frame specific intensities are transformed to the co-moving frame via Lorentz transformation when the source term is calculated. Therefore, the scheme does not need any expansion in terms of v/c. The radiation energy and momentum source terms for the gas are calculated via direct quadrature in the angular space. The time step for the whole scheme is determined by the normal Courant -- Friedrichs -- Lewy condition in the MHD module. We provide a variety of test problems for this algorithm including both optically thick and thin regimes, and for both gas and radiation pressure dominated flows to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency.

Using the set of Brussels-Montreal unified equations of state, we have computed the gravitoelectric Love numbers kl and the gravitomagnetic Love numbers jl up to l=5. Their relative importance and their sensitivity to the symmetry energy and the neutron-matter stiffness are numerically assessed. Their impact on the phase of the gravitational-wave signal emitted by binary neutron star inspirals is also discussed.

title: A DG-IMEX method for two-moment neutrino transport: Nonlinear solvers for neutrino-matter coupling
authors: M. Paul Laiu, Eirik Endeve, Ran Chu, J. Austin Harris, O. E. Bronson Messer
topic: Neutrino-matter interactions play an important role in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions as they contribute to both lepton number and/or four-momentum exchange between neutrinos and matter, and thus act as the agent for neutrino-driven explosions. Due to the multiscale nature of neutrino transport in CCSN simulations, an implicit treatment of neutrino-matter interactions is desired, which requires solutions of coupled nonlinear systems in each step of the time integration scheme. In this paper we design and compare nonlinear iterative solvers for implicit systems with energy coupling neutrino-matter interactions commonly used in CCSN simulations. Specifically, we consider electron neutrinos and antineutrinos, which interact with static matter configurations through the Bruenn~85 opacity set. The implicit systems arise from the discretization of a non-relativistic two-moment model for neutrino transport, which employs the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for phase-space discretization and an implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration scheme. In the context of this DG-IMEX scheme, we propose two approaches to formulate the nonlinear systems -- a coupled approach and a nested approach. For each approach, the resulting systems are solved with Anderson-accelerated fixed-point iteration and Newton's method. The performance of these four iterative solvers has been compared on relaxation problems with various degree of collisionality, as well as proto-neutron star deleptonization problems with several matter profiles adopted from spherically symmetric CCSN simulations. Numerical results suggest that the nested Anderson-accelerated fixed-point solver is more efficient than other tested solvers for solving implicit nonlinear systems with energy coupling neutrino-matter interactions.

title: A 3D radiative transfer framework: XII. Many-core, vector and GPU methods
authors: Peter H. Hauschildt, E. Baron
topic: 3D detailed radiative transfer is computationally taxing, since the solution of the radiative transfer equation involves traversing the six dimensional phase space of the 3D domain. With modern supercomputers the hardware available for wallclock speedup is rapidly changing, mostly in response to requirements to minimize the cost of electrical power. Given the variety of modern computing architectures, we aim to develop and adapt algorithms for different computing architectures to improve performance on a wide variety of platforms. We implemented the main time consuming kernels for solving 3D radiative transfer problems for vastly different computing architectures using MPI, OpenMP, OpenACC and vector algorithms. Adapted algorithms lead to massively improved speed for all architectures, making extremely large model calculations easily feasible. These calculations would have previously been considered impossible or prohibitively expensive. Efficient use of modern computing devices is entirely feasible, but unfortunately requires the implementation of specialized algorithms for them.

title: Magnetically Modified Spherical Accretion in GRMHD: Reconnection-Driven Convection and Jet Propagation
authors: Sean M. Ressler, Eliot Quataert, Christopher J. White, Omer Blaes
topic: We present 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic(GRMHD) simulations of zero angular momentum accretion around a rapidly rotating black hole, modified by the presence of initially uniform magnetic fields. We consider serveral angles between the magnetic field direction and the black hole spin. In the resulting flows, the midplane dynamics are governed by magnetic reconnection-driven turbulence in a magnetically arrested (or a nearly arrested) state. Electromagnetic jets with outflow efficiencies ~10-200% occupy the polar regions, reaching several hundred gravitational radii before they dissipate due to the kink instability. The jet directions fluctuate in time and can be tilted by as much as ~30 degrees with respect to black hole spin, but this tilt does not depend strongly on the tilt of the initial magnetic field. A jet forms even when there is no initial net vertical magnetic flux since turbulent, horizon-scale fluctuations can generate a net vertical field locally. Peak jet power is obtained for an initial magnetic field tilted by 40-80 degrees with respect to the black hole spin because this maximizes the amount of magnetic flux that can reach the black hole. These simulations may be a reasonable model for low luminosity black hole accretion flows such as Sgr A* or M87.

title: Long-term evolution of a merger-remnant neutron star in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics I: Effect of magnetic winding
authors: Masaru Shibata, Sho Fujibayashi, Yuichiro Sekiguchi
topic: Long-term ideal and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations in full general relativity are performed for a massive neutron star formed as a remnant of binary neutron star mergers. Neutrino radiation transport effects are taken into account as in our previous papers. The simulation is performed in axial symmetry and without considering dynamo effects as a first step. In the ideal MHD, the differential rotation of the remnant neutron star amplifies the magnetic-field strength by the winding in the presence of a seed poloidal field until the electromagnetic energy reaches ~10% of the rotational kinetic energy, Ekin, of the neutron star. The timescale until the maximum electromagnetic energy is reached depends on the initial magnetic-field strength and it is ~1 s for the case that the initial maximum magnetic-field strength is ~1015 G. After a significant amplification of the magnetic-field strength by the winding, the magnetic braking enforces the initially differentially rotating state approximately to a rigidly rotating state. In the presence of the resistivity, the amplification is continued only for the resistive timescale, and if the maximum electromagnetic energy reached is smaller than ~3% of Ekin, the initial differential rotation state is approximately preserved. In the present context, the post-merger mass ejection is induced primarily by the neutrino irradiation/heating and the magnetic winding effect plays only a minor role for the mass ejection.

title: Maximum mass of compact stars from gravitational wave events with finite-temperature equations of state
authors: Sanika Khadkikar, Adriana R. Raduta, Micaela Oertel, Armen Sedrakian
topic: We conjecture and verify a set of universal relations between global parameters of {\it hot and fast-rotating} compact stars, including a relation connecting the masses of the mass-shedding (Kepler) and static configurations. We apply these relations to the GW170817 event by adopting the scenario in which a hypermassive compact star remnant formed in a merger evolves into a supramassive compact star that collapses into a black hole once the stability line for such stars is crossed. We deduce an upper limit on the maximum mass of static, cold neutron stars for the typical range of entropy per baryon and electron fraction Ye=0.1 characterizing the hot hypermassive star. Our result implies that accounting for the finite temperature of the merger remnant relaxes previously derived constraints on the value of the maximum mass of a cold, static compact star.

title: R-process-rich stellar streams in the Milky Way
authors: Maude Gull, Anna Frebel, Karina Hinojosa, Ian U. Roederer, Alexander P. Ji, Kaley Brauer
topic: Detailed chemical abundances of light elements as well as heavy neutron-capture elements have been determined for our 22 stars. For 13 stars, neutron-capture element lines were detectable and they all show signatures in agreement with the scaled solar r-process pattern, albeit with a large spread of... Eight of these stars show an additional small s-process contribution superposed onto their r-process pattern. This could be discerned because of the relatively high S/N of the spectra given that the stars are close by in the halo. Our results suggest that the progenitors of these streams experienced one or more r-process events, such as a neutron star merger or another prolific r-process source, early on that widely enriched these host systems before their accretion by the Milky Way. The small s-process contribution suggests the presence of AGB stars and associated local (inhomogeneous) enrichment as part of the ongoing chemical evolution by low mass stars. Stars in stellar streams may thus be a promising avenue for studying the detailed history of large dwarf galaxies and their role in halo assembly with easily accessible targets for high-quality spectra of many stars.

title: Intermittent mildly magnetized jets as the source of GRBs
authors: Ore Gottlieb, Omer Bromberg, Amir Levinson, Ehud Nakar
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powered by relativistic jets that exhibit intermittency over a broad range of timescales - from ~ ms to seconds. Previous numerical studies have shown that hydrodynamic (i.e., unmagnetized) jets that are expelled from a variable engine are subject to strong mixing of jet and cocoon material, which strongly inhibits the GRB emission. In this paper we conduct 3D RMHD simulations of mildly magnetized jets with power modulation over durations of 0.1 s and 1 s, and a steady magnetic field at injection. We find that when the jet magnetization at the launching site is sigma~0.1, the initial magnetization is amplified by shocks formed in the flow to the point where it strongly suppresses baryon loading. We estimate that a significant contamination can be avoided if the magnetic energy at injection constitutes at least a few percent of the jet energy. The variability timescales of the jet after it breaks out of the star are then governed by the injection cycles rather than by the mixing process, suggesting that in practice jet injection should fluctuate on timescales as short as ~10 ms in order to account for the observed light curves. Better stability is found for jets with shorter modulations. We conclude that for sufficiently hot jets, the Lorentz factor near the photosphere can be high enough to allow efficient photospheric emission. Our results imply that jets with 10-2 less sigma less 1 injected by a variable engine with ~10 ms duty cycle are plausible sources of long GRBs.

title: How will our knowledge on SGRB affect the distance measurement of BNS?
authors: Minghui Du, Lixin Xu
topic: Binary neutron star associated with short Gamma ray burst has drawn wide attention ever since the observation of GW170817, due to its potential application in cosmology. While, further application of this sort of event suffers from the problem of degeneracy between luminosity distance and inclination angle, especially in the face-on limit. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by taking into account a Gaussian prior on the inclination angle. To test the property of resulting posterior distribution, we generate four catalogues of 1000 events by varying the number of third-generation detectors and the scale of prior. It turns out that a network of detectors tends to recognize more and farther events than a single detector.

title: Neutron Stars Harboring a Primordial Black Hole: Maximum Survival Time
authors: Thomas W. Baumgarte, Stuart L. Shapiro
topic: We explore in general relativity the survival time of neutron stars that host an endoparasitic, possibly primordial, black hole at their center. Corresponding to the minimum steady-state Bondi accretion rate for adiabatic flow that we found earlier for stiff nuclear equations of state (EOSs), we derive analytically the maximum survival time after which the entire star will be consumed by the black hole. We also show that this maximum survival time depends only weakly on the stiffness for polytropic EOSs with Gamma>5/3, so that this survival time assumes a nearly universal value that depends on the initial black hole mass alone. Establishing such a value is important for constraining the contribution of primordial black holes in the mass range 10-16Msun less M less 10-10Msun to the dark-matter content of the Universe.

title: Multimessenger signals from black hole-neutron star mergers without significant tidal disruption
authors: William E. East, Luis Lehner, Steven L. Liebling, Carlos Palenzuela
topic: We study the multimessenger signals from the merger of a black hole with a magnetized neutron star using resistive magneto-hydrodynamics simulations coupled to full general relativity. We focus on a case with a 5:1 mass-ratio, where only a small amount of the neutron star matter remains post-merger, but we nevertheless find that significant electromagnetic radiation can be powered by the interaction of the neutron star's magnetosphere with the black hole. In the lead-up to merger, strong twisting of magnetic field lines from the inspiral leads to plasmoid emission and results in a luminosity in excess of that expected from unipolar induction. We find that the strongest emission occurs shortly after merger during a transitory period in which magnetic loops form and escape the central region. The remaining magnetic field collimates around the spin axis of the remnant black hole before dissipating, an indication that, in more favorable scenarios (higher black hole spin/lower mass ratio) with larger accretion disks, a jet would form.

title: Where binary neutron stars merge: predictions from IllustrisTNG
authors: Jonah C. Rose, Paul Torrey, K.H. Lee, I. Bartos
topic: The rate and location of Binary Neutron Star (BNS) mergers are determined by a combination of the star formation history and the Delay Time Distribution (DTD) function. In this paper, we couple the star formation rate histories (SFRHs) from the IllustrisTNG model to a series of varied assumptions for the BNS DTD to make predictions for the BNS merger host galaxy mass function. These predictions offer two outcomes: (i) in the near term: influence BNS merger event follow-up strategy by scrutinizing where most BNS merger events are expected to occur and (ii) in the long term: constrain the DTD for BNS merger events once the host galaxy mass function is observationally well determined. From our fiducial model analysis, we predict that 50% of BNS mergers will occur in host galaxies with stellar mass between 1010−1011 Msun, 68% between 4x109-3x1011 Msun, and 95% between 4x108-2x1012 Msun. We find that the details of the DTD employed does not have a strong effect on the peak of the host mass function. However, varying the DTD provides enough spread that the true DTD can be determined from enough electromagnetic observations of BNS mergers. Knowing the true DTD can help us determine the prevalence of BNS systems formed through highly eccentric and short separation fast-merging channels and can constrain the dominant source of r-process material.

title: Off-axis jet scenario for early afterglow emission of low-luminosity gamma-ray burst GRB 190829A
authors: Yuri Sato, Kaori Obayashi, Ryo Yamazaki, Kohta Murase, Yutaka Ohira
topic: Recently, ground-based Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes have reported the detection of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). One of them, GRB~190829A, was triggered by the Swift satellite, and about 20000 s after the burst onset the VHE gamma-ray emission was detected by H.E.S.S. with ~ 5 sigma significance. This event had unusual features of having much smaller isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energy than typical long GRBs and achromatic peaks in X-ray and optical afterglow at about 1400 s. Here we propose an off-axis jet scenario that explains these observational results. In this model, the relativistic beaming effect is responsible for the apparently small isotropic gamma-ray energy and spectral peak energy. Using a jetted afterglow model, we find that the narrow jet, which has the initial Lorentz factor of 350 and the initial jet opening half-angle of 0.015 rad, viewed off-axis can describe the observed achromatic behavior in the X-ray and optical afterglow. Another wide, baryon-loaded jet is necessary for the later-epoch X-ray and radio emissions. According to our model, the VHE gamma rays observed by H.E.S.S. at 20000 s may come from the narrow jet through the synchrotron self-Compton process.

title: Black Hole - Neutron Star Binary Mergers: The Imprint of Tidal Deformations and Debris
authors: Bhavesh Khamesra, Miguel Gracia-Linares, Pablo Laguna
topic: The increase in the sensitivity of gravitational wave interferometers will bring additional detections of binary black hole and double neutron star mergers. It will also very likely add many merger events of black hole - neutron star binaries. Distinguishing mixed binaries from binary black holes mergers for high mass ratios could be challenging because in this situation the neutron star coalesces with the black hole without experiencing significant disruption. To investigate the transition of mixed binary mergers into those behaving more like binary black hole coalescences, we present results from merger simulations for different mass ratios. We show how the degree of deformation and disruption of the neutron star impacts the inspiral and merger dynamics, the properties of the final black hole, the accretion disk formed from the circularization of the tidal debris, the gravitational waves, and the strain spectrum and mismatches. The results also show the effectiveness of the initial data method that generalizes the Bowen-York initial data for black hole punctures to the case of binaries with neutron star companions.

title: Mildly relativistic magnetized shocks in electron-ion plasmas -- II. Particle acceleration and heating
authors: Arianna Ligorini, Jacek Niemiec, Oleh Kobzar, Masanori Iwamoto, Artem Bohdan, Martin Pohl, Yosuke Matsumoto, Takanobu Amano, Shuichi Matsukiyo, Masahiro Hoshino
topic: Particle acceleration and heating at mildly relativistic magnetized shocks in electron-ion plasma are investigated with unprecedentedly high-resolution two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations that include ion-scale shock rippling. Electrons are super-adiabatically heated at the shock, and most of the energy transfer from protons to electrons takes place at or downstream of the shock. We are the first to demonstrate that shock rippling is crucial for the energization of electrons at the shock. They remain well below equipartition with the protons. The downstream electron spectra are approximately thermal with a limited supra-thermal power-law component. Our results are discussed in the context of wakefield acceleration and the modelling of electromagnetic radiation from blazar cores.

title: Black Holes LIGO/Virgo Domination and Single-lined Binaries with a Black Hole Candidate Component
authors: Vladimir Lipunov, Evgeny Gorbovskoy, Valeria Grinshpun, Daniil Vlasenko
topic: In this letter, we note that the observed in the LIGO / Virgo experiment ratio of the detection rate of black holes to the rate of detection of binary neutron stars requires the assumption of a "conservative" collapse of massive stars into a black hole: almost all the mass of the collapsing star goes under the horizon. This is consistent with the large masses of black holes detected by LIGO/Virgo. On the other hand, the assumption of a small loss of matter during the collapse into a black hole is in good agreement with the small eccentricity of Single-lined Binaries. At the same time, the absence of X-rays from most black holes in binary systems with blue stars is explained. We argue that three sets of LIGO / Virgo observations and data on the Single-lined Binary with a Candidate Black Hole Component confirm the scenario of the evolution of massive field binaries.

title: Relativistic Bondi accretion for stiff equations of state
authors: Chloe B. Richards, Thomas W. Baumgarte, Stuart L. Shapiro
topic: We revisit Bondi accretion - steady-state, adiabatic, spherical gas flow onto a Schwarzschild black hole at rest in an asymptotically homogeneous medium - for stiff polytropic equations of state (EOSs) with adiabatic indices Gamma > 5/3. A general relativistic treatment is required to determine their accretion rates, for which we provide exact expressions. We discuss several qualitative differences between results for soft and stiff EOSs - including the appearance of a minimum steady-state accretion rate for EOSs with Gamma \geq 5/3 - and explore limiting cases in order to examine these differences. As an example we highlight results for Gamma=2, which is often used in numerical simulations to model the EOS of neutron stars. We also discuss a special case with this index, the ultra-relativistic `causal' EOS, P=rho. The latter serves as a useful limit for the still undetermined neutron-star EOS above nuclear density. The results are useful, for example, to estimate the accretion rate onto a mini-black hole residing at the center of a neutron star.

title: A comprehensive view of blackbody components in the X-ray spectra of GRBs
authors: Vlasta Valan, Josefin Larsson
topic: A small fraction of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibit blackbody emission in the X-ray spectra, the origin of which is debated. In order to gain a more complete understanding of this phenomenon, we present a search for blackbody components in 116 GRBs with known redshifts observed by {\it Swift}~XRT. A time-resolved spectral analysis is carried out and the significance of the blackbody is assessed with respect to an absorbed power-law model. We report nine new detections and confirm the previously reported blackbody in GRB171205A. Together with our previous results, there are a total of 19 GRBs with significant blackbody emission in a sample of 199 GRBs observed by {\it Swift} over 13 years. The detections include one short GRB and two low-luminosity GRBs. We estimate fireball parameters from the blackbody components and note that the blackbody luminosity is correlated with the temperature and inferred Lorentz factor. There is a large spread in the properties of the blackbody components and the light curves, which points to different origins for the emission. In about a third of the GRBs, the blackbody is clearly associated with late prompt emission from the jet. The rest of the sample includes cases that are fully consistent with the expectations from a cocoon, as well cases that may be explained by high-latitude emission or more energetic cocoons. These results indicate that thermal emission is associated with all parts of the jet.

title: Constraints on the presence of platinum and gold in the spectra of the kilonova AT2017gfo
authors: James H. Gillanders, Michael McCann, Stuart A. Sim. Stephen J. Smartt, Connor P. Ballance
topic: Binary neutron star mergers are thought to be one of the dominant sites of production for rapid neutron capture elements, and the source of platinum and gold in the Universe. Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817, and its associated kilonova AT2017gfo, numerous works have attempted to determine the composition of its outflowing material, but they have been hampered by the lack of complete atomic data. Here we demonstrate how inclusion of new atomic data in synthetic spectra calculations can provide insights and constraints on the production of the heaviest elements. We employ theoretical atomic data for neutral, singly- and doubly-ionised platinum and gold, to generate photospheric and simple nebular-phase model spectra for kilonova-like ejecta properties. We make predictions for the locations of strong transitions, which could feasibly appear in the spectra of kilonovae that are rich in these species. We use GRASP0 to generate the underlying atomic structure and TARDIS to model the diffusion phase showing that the strongest features lie in the ultra-violet region. We identify low-lying electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole transitions that may give rise to forbidden lines when the ejecta becomes optically thin. The strongest lines lie beyond 8000 Angstroms, motivating high quality near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up of kilonova candidates. We compare our model spectra to the observed spectra of AT2017gfo, and conclude that no platinum or gold signatures are prominent in the ejecta. This work demonstrates how new atomic data of heavy elements can be included in radiative transfer calculations, and motivates future searches for elemental signatures.

title: The Role of Strong Gravity and the Nuclear Equation of State on Neutron-Star Common-Envelope Accretion
authors: A. Miguel Holgado, Hector O. Silva, Paul M. Ricker, Nicolas Yunes
topic: Common-envelope evolution is important in the formation of neutron star binaries within the isolated binary formation channel. As a neutron star inspirals within the envelope of a primary massive star, it accretes and spins up. Because neutron stars are in the strong-gravity regime, they have a substantial relativistic mass deficit, i.e., their gravitational mass is less than their baryonic mass. This effect causes some fraction of the accreted baryonic mass to convert into neutron star binding energy. The relativistic mass deficit also depends on the nuclear equation of state, since more compact neutron stars will have larger binding energies. We model the mass growth and spin-up of neutron stars inspiraling within common-envelope environments and quantify how different initial binary conditions and hadronic equations of state affect the post-common-envelope neutron star's mass and spin. From these models, we find that neutron star mass growth is suppressed by =15-30%. We also find that for a given amount of accreted baryonic mass, more compact neutron stars will spin-up faster while gaining less gravitational mass, and vice versa. This work demonstrates that a neutron star's strong gravity and nuclear microphysics plays a role in neutron-star-common-envelope evolution, in addition to the macroscopic astrophysics of the envelope. Strong gravity and the nuclear equation of state may thus affect both the population properties of neutron star binaries and the cosmic double neutron star merger rate.

title: Two-dimensional Inflow-Wind Solution of Hot Accretion Flow. I. Hydrodynamics
authors: Amin Mosallanezhad, Fatemeh Zahra Zeraatgari, Liquan Mei, De-Fu Bu
topic: We solve the two-dimensional hydrodynamic equations of hot accretion flow in the presence of the thermal conduction. The flow is assumed to be in steady-state and axisymmetric, and self-similar approximation is adopted in the radial direction. In this hydrodynamic study, we consider the viscous stress tensor to mimic the effects of the magnetorotational instability for driving angular momentum. We impose the physical boundary conditions at both the rotation axis and the equatorial plane and obtain the solutions in the full r-theta space. We have found that thermal conduction is indispensable term for investigating the inflow-wind structure of the hot accretion flows with very low mass accretion rates. One of the most interesting results here is that the disc is convectively stable in hot accretion mode and in the presence of the thermal conduction. Furthermore, the properties of wind and also its driving mechanisms are studied. Our analytical results are consistent with previous numerical simulations of hot accretion flow.

title: The Observed Rate of Binary Black Hole Mergers can be Entirely Explained by Globular Clusters
authors: Carl L. Rodriguez, Kyle Kremer, Sourav Chatterjee, Giacomo Fragione, Abraham Loeb, Frederic A. Rasio, Newlin C. Weatherford, Claire S. Ye
topic: Since the first signal in 2015, the gravitational-wave (GW) detections of merging binary black holes (BBHs) by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations (LVC) have completely transformed our understanding of the lives and deaths of compact object binaries, and have motivated an enormous amount of theoretical and phenomenological work on the astrophysical origin of these objects. In this work, we show that the phenomenological fit to the redshift-dependent merger rate of BBHs from Abbott et al. (2020) is consistent with a purely dynamical origin for these objects, and that the current merger rate of BBHs from the LVC could be explained entirely with globular clusters alone. While this does not prove that globular clusters (GCs) are the only (or even dominant) formation channel, we emphasize that many potential formation scenarios could contribute a significant fraction of the current LVC rate, and that any analysis that assumes a single (or dominant) mechanism for producing BBH mergers is implicitly using a specious astrophysical prior.

title: R-process enhancements of Gaia-Enceladus in GALAH DR3
authors: Tadafumi Matsuno, Yutaka Hirai, Yuta Tarumi, Kenta Hotokezaka, Masaomi Tanaka, Amina Helmi
topic: The dominant site of production of r-process elements remains unclear despite recent observations of a neutron star merger. Observational constraints on the properties of the sites can be obtained by comparing r-process abundances in different environments. The recent Gaia data releases and large samples from high-resolution optical spectroscopic surveys are enabling us to compare r-process element abundances between stars formed in an accreted dwarf galaxy, Gaia-Enceladus, and those formed in the Milky Way. We aim to understand the origin of r-process elements in Gaia-Enceladus. We first construct a sample of stars to study Eu abundances without being affected by the detection limit. We then kinematically select 71 Gaia-Enceladus stars and 93 in-situ stars from the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) DR3, of which 50 and 75 stars can be used to study Eu reliably. Gaia-Enceladus stars clearly show higher ratios of [{Eu}/{Mg}] than in-situ stars. High [{Eu}/{Mg}] along with low [{Mg}/{Fe}] are also seen in relatively massive satellite galaxies such as the LMC, Fornax, and Sagittarius dwarfs. On the other hand, unlike these galaxies, Gaia-Enceladus does not show enhanced [{Ba}/{Eu}] or [{La}/{Eu}] ratios suggesting a lack of significant s-process contribution. From comparisons with simple chemical evolution models, we show that the high [{Eu}/{Mg}] of Gaia-Enceladus can naturally be explained by considering r-process enrichment by neutron-star mergers with delay time distribution that follows a similar power-law as type~Ia supernovae but with a shorter minimum delay time.

title: Constraining neutron star radii in black hole-neutron star mergers from their electromagnetic counterparts
authors: Giacomo Fragione, Abraham Loeb
topic: Mergers of black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) binaries are of interest since the emission of gravitational waves (GWs) can be followed by an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart, which could power short gamma-ray bursts. Until now, LIGO/Virgo has only observed a candidate BH-NS event, GW190426-152155, which was not followed by any EM counterpart. We show how the presence (absence) of a remnant disk, which powers the EM counterpart, can be used along with spin measurements by LIGO/Virgo to derive a lower (upper) limit on the radius of the NS. For the case of GW190426-152155, large measurement errors on the spin prevent from placing an upper limit on the NS radius. Our proposed method works best when the aligned component of the BH spin (with respect to the orbital angular momentum) is the largest, and can be used to complement the information that can be extracted from the GW signal to derive valuable information on the NS equation of state.

title: Flux variability from ejectas in structured relativistic jets with large-scale magnetic fields
authors: Gaëtan Fichet de Clairfontaine, Zakaria Meliani, Andreas Zech, Olivier Hervet
topic: Using the relativistic MHD code MPI-AMRVAC and a radiative transfer code in post-processing, we explore the influence of the magnetic-field configuration and transverse stratification of an over-pressured jet on its morphology, on the moving shock dynamics, and on the emitted radio light curve. First, we investigate different large-scale magnetic fields with their effects on the standing shocks and on the stratified jet morphology. Secondly, we study the interaction of a moving shock wave with the standing shocks. We calculate the synthetic synchrotron maps and radio light curves and analyse the variability at two frequencies 1 and 15.3 GHz and for several observation angles. Finally, we compare the characteristics of our simulated light curves with radio flares observed from the blazar 3C 273 with OVRO and VLBA in the MOJAVE survey between 2008 and 2019. We find that, in a structured, over-pressured relativistic jet, the presence of the large-scale magnetic field structure changes the properties of the standing shock waves and leads to an opening of the jet. When crossing such standing shocks, moving shock waves accompanying overdensities injected in the base of the jet are causing very luminous radio flares. The observation of the temporal structure of these flares under different viewing angles probes the jet at different optical depths. At 1 GHz and for small angles, the self-absorption caused by the moving shock wave becomes more important and leads to a drop in the observed flux after it interacts with the brightest standing knot. A weak asymmetry is seen in the shape of the simulated flares, resulting from the remnant emission of the shocked standing shocks. The characteristics of the simulated flares and the correlation of peaks in the light curve with the crossing of moving and standing shocks favor this scenario as an explanation of the observed radio flares of 3C 273.

title: Precessing magnetars as central engines in short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Arthur G. Suvorov, Kostas D. Kokkotas
topic: Short gamma-ray bursts that are followed by long-duration X-ray plateaus may be powered by the birth, and hydrodynamic evolution, of magnetars from compact binary coalescence events. If the rotation and magnetic axes of the system are not orthogonal to each other the star will undergo free precession, leading to fluctuations in the luminosity of the source. In some cases, precession-induced modulations in the spindown power may be discernible in the X-ray flux of the plateau. In this work, 25 X-ray light-curves associated with bursts exhibiting a plateau are fitted to luminosity profiles appropriate for precessing, oblique rotators. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion, sixteen (64%) of the magnetars within the sample display either moderate or strong evidence for precession. Additionally, since the precession period of the star is directly tied to its quadrupolar ellipticity, the fits allow for an independent measure of the extent to which the star is deformed by internal stresses. Assuming these deformations arise due to a mixed poloidal-toroidal magnetic field, we find that the distribution of magnetic-energy ratios is bimodal, with data points clustering around energetically-equal and toroidally-dominated partitions. Implications of this result for gravitational-wave emission and dynamo activity in newborn magnetars are discussed.

title: The final core collapse of pulsational pair instability supernovae
authors: Jade Powell, Bernhard Müller, Alexander Heger
topic: We present 3D core-collapse supernova simulations of massive Pop-III progenitor stars at the transition to the pulsational pair instability regime. We simulate two progenitor models with initial masses of 85Msaun and 100Msun with the LS220, SFHo, and SFHx equations of state. The 85Msun progenitor experiences a pair instability pulse coincident with core collapse, whereas the 100Msun progenitor has already gone through a sequence of four pulses 1,500 years before collapse in which it ejected its H and He envelope. The 85Msun models experience shock revival and then delayed collapse to a black hole (BH) due to ongoing accretion within hundreds of milliseconds. The diagnostic energy of the incipient explosion reaches up to 2.7x1051erg in the SFHx model. Due to the high binding energy of the metal core, BH collapse by fallback is eventually unavoidable, but partial mass ejection may be possible. The 100Msun models have not achieved shock revival or undergone BH collapse by the end of the simulation. All models exhibit relatively strong gravitational-wave emission both in the high-frequency g-mode emission band and at low frequencies. The SFHx and SFHo models show clear emission from the standing accretion shock instability. For our models, we estimate maximum detection distances of up to ~46kpc with LIGO and ~850kpc with Cosmic Explorer.

title: Temporal Evolution of Prompt GRB Polarization
authors: Ramandeep Gill, Jonathan Granot
topic: The dominant radiation mechanism that produces the prompt emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains a major open question. Spectral information alone has proven insufficient in elucidating its nature. Time-resolved linear polarization has the potential to distinguish between popular emission mechanisms, e.g., synchrotron radiation from electrons with a power-law energy distribution or inverse Compton scattering of soft seed thermal photons, which can yield the typical GRB spectrum but produce different levels of polarization. Furthermore, it can be used to learn about the outflow's composition (i.e. whether it is kinetic-energy-dominated or Poynting-flux-dominated) and angular structure. For synchrotron emission it is a powerful probe of the magnetic field geometry. Here we consider synchrotron emission from a thin ultrarelativistic outflow, with bulk Lorentz factor, that radiates a Band-function spectrum in a single (multiple) pulse(s) over a range of radii. Pulse profiles and polarization evolution at a given energy are presented for a coasting (m=0) and accelerating (m=-2/3) thin spherical shell and for an off-axis top-hat jet with sharp as well as smooth edges in emissivity. Four different magnetic field configurations are considered, such as a locally ordered field coherent over angular scales, a tangled field in the plane transverse to the radial direction, an ordered field aligned in the radial direction, and a globally ordered toroidal field (Btor). All field configurations produce distinct polarization evolution with single and double (for Btor) 90deg changes in the polarization position angle.

We aim to advance knowledge on the physics of kilonovae, the electromagnetic transients following a merger, which are relevant for the study of the origin of heavy nuclei in the Universe produced via r-process nucleosynthesis. In this paper, we present preliminary results of numerical simulations for some physics cases considered in the light of a possible experimental setup for future in-laboratory opacity spectroscopic measurements.

authors: Chengchao Yuan, Kohta Murase, B. Theodore Zhang, Shigeo S. Kimura, Peter Mészáros
topic: As a powerful source of gravitational waves (GW), a supermassive black hole (SMBH) merger may be accompanied by a relativistic jet that leads to detectable electromagnetic emission (EM). We model the propagation of post-merger jets inside a pre-merger circumnuclear environment formed by disk winds, and calculate multi-wavelength EM spectra from the forward shock region. We show that the non-thermal EM signals from SMBH mergers are detectable up to the detection horizon of future GW facilities such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Calculations based on our model predict slowly fading transients with time delays from days to months after the coalescence, leading to implications for EM follow-up observations after the GW detection.

title: Deep Learning Model on Gravitational Waveforms in Merging and Ringdown Phases of Binary Black Hole Coalescences
authors: Joongoo Lee, Sang Hoon Oh, Kyungmin Kim, Gihyuk Cho, John J. Oh, Edwin J. Son, Hyung Mok Lee
topic: The waveform templates of the matched filtering-based gravitational-wave search ought to cover wide range of parameters for the prosperous detection. Numerical relativity (NR) has been widely accepted as the most accurate method for modeling the waveforms. Still, it is well-known that NR typically requires a tremendous amount of computational costs. In this paper, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of a novel deterministic deep learning (DL) architecture that can generate gravitational waveforms from the merger and ringdown phases of the non-spinning binary black hole coalescence. Our model takes O(1) seconds for generating approximately 1500 waveforms with a 99.9\% match on average to one of the state-of-the-art waveform approximants, the effective-one-body. We also perform matched filtering with the DL-waveforms and find that the waveforms can recover the event time of the injected gravitational-wave signals.

title: Effects of resistivity on standing shocks in low angular momentum flows around black holes
authors: Chandra B. Singh, Toru Okuda, Ramiz Aktar
topic: We study two dimensional low angular momentum flow around the black hole using the resistive magnetohydrodynamic module of PLUTO code. Simulations have been performed for the flows with parameters of specific angular momentum, specific energy, and magnetic field which may be expected for the flow around Sgr Aastar. For flows with lower resistivity, the luminosity and the shock location on the equator vary quasi-periodically. The power density spectra of luminosity variation show the peak frequencies which correspond to the periods of 5e5, 1.4e5, and 5e4 seconds, respectively. These quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) occur due to the interaction between the outer oscillating standing shock and the inner weak shocks occurring at the innermost hot blob. While for cases with higher resistivity of, the high resistivity considerably suppresses the magnetic activity such as the MHD turbulence and the flows tend to be steady and symmetric to the equator. The steady standing shock is formed more outward compared with the hydrodynamical flow. The low angular momentum flow model with the above flow parameters and with low resistivity has a possibility for the explanation of the long-term flares with ~ one per day and ~ 5 - 10 days of Sgr Astar in the latest observations by Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton monitoring of Sgr Astar.

title: Alternative possibility of GW190521: Gravitational waves from high-mass black hole-disk systems
authors: Masaru Shibata, Kenta Kiuchi, Sho Fujibayashi, Yuichiro Sekiguchi
topic: We evolve high-mass disks of mass 15-50Msun orbiting a 50Msun spinning black hole in the framework of numerical relativity. Such high-mass systems could be an outcome during the collapse of rapidly-rotating very-massive stars. The massive disks are dynamically unstable to the so-called one-armed spiral-shape deformation with the maximum fractional density-perturbation of delta_rho/rho  greater 0.1, and hence, high-amplitude gravitational waves are emitted. The waveforms are characterized by an initial high-amplitude burst with the frequency of ~40-50 Hz and the maximum amplitude of (1-10)times10−22 at the hypothetical distance of 100 Mpc and by a subsequent low-amplitude quasi-periodic oscillation. We illustrate that the waveforms in our models with a wide range of the disk mass resemble that of GW190521. We also point out that gravitational waves from rapidly-rotating very-massive stars can be the source for 3rd-generation gravitational-wave detectors for exploring the formation process of rapidly-rotating high-mass black holes of mass ~50-100Msun in an early universe.

title: The Physics of Accretion Discs, Winds And Jets in Tidal Disruption Events
authors: Jane Lixin Dai, Giuseppe Lodato, Roseanne M. Cheng
topic: Accretion onto black holes is an efficient mechanism in converting the gas mass-energy into energetic outputs as radiation, wind and jet. Tidal disruption events, in which stars are tidally torn apart and then accreted onto supermassive black holes, offer unique opportunities of studying the accretion physics as well as the wind and jet launching physics across different accretion regimes. In this review, we systematically describe and discuss the models that have been developed to study the accretion flows and jets in tidal disruption events. A good knowledge of these physics is not only needed for understanding the emissions of the observed events, but also crucial for probing the general relativistic space-time around black holes and the demographics of supermassive black holes via tidal disruption events.

title: Determining the viewing angle of neutron star merger jets with VLBI radio images
authors: Joseph John Fernández, Shiho Kobayashi, Gavin P. Lamb
topic: Very long base interferometry (VLBI) radio images recently proved to be essential in breaking the degeneracy in the ejecta model for the neutron star merger event GW170817. We discuss the properties of synthetic radio images of merger jet afterglow by using semi-analytic models of laterally spreading or non-spreading jets. The image centroid initially moves away from the explosion point in the sky with an apparent superlumianal velocity. After reaching a maximum displacement its motion is reversed. This behavior is in line with that found in full hydrodynamics simulations. Since the evolution of the centroid shift and jet image size are significantly different in the two jet models, observations of these characteristics for very bright events might be able to confirm or constrain the lateral expansion law of merger jets. We explicitly demonstrate how θobs is obtained by the centroid shift of radio images or its apparent velocity provided the ratio of the jet core size θc and the viewing angle θobs is determined by afterglow light curves. We show that a simple method based on a point-source approximation provides reasonable angular estimates (10-20% errors at most). By taking a sample of structured Gaussian jet results, we find that the model with theta_obs~0.32 rad can explain the main features of the GW170817 afterglow light curves and the radio images.

title: Common envelope jets supernovae with a black hole companion as possible high energy neutrino sources
authors: Aldana Grichener, Noam Soker 
topic: We study high energy neutrino emission from relativistic jets launched by a black hole (BH) spiraling-in inside the envelope of a red supergiant (RSG), and find that such common envelope jets supernovae (CEJSNe) are a potential source for the ~10^15 eV neutrinos detected by IceCube. We first use the stellar evolution code MESA to mimic the effect of the jets on the RSG envelope, and find that the jets substantially inflate the envelope. We then study the propagation of jets inside the extended RSG envelope and find that in most cases the jets do not penetrate the envelope but are rather stalled. We show that such jets can accelerate cosmic rays to high enough energies to produce high energy neutrinos. While the neutrinos stream out freely, the gamma-rays that accompany the neutrino production remain trapped inside the optically thick envelope. This explains the lack of observational association between high energy neutrinos and gamma-rays.

title: Circular Orbits Structure and Thin Accretion Disks around Kerr Black Holes with Scalar Hair
authors: Lucas G. Collodel, Daniela D. Doneva, Stoytcho S. Yazadjiev
topic: In this paper we first investigate the equatorial circular orbit structure of Kerr black holes with scalar hair (KBHsSH) and highlight their most prominent features which are quite distinct from the exterior region of ordinary bald Kerr black holes, i.e. peculiarities that arise from the combined bound system of a hole with an off-center, self-gravitating distribution of scalar matter. Some of these traits are incompatible with the thin disk approach, thus we identify and map out various regions in the parameter space respectively. All the solutions for which the stable circular orbital velocity (and angular momentum) curve is continuous are used for building thin and optically thick disks around them, from which we extract the radiant energy fluxes, luminosities and efficiencies. We compare the results in batches with the same spin parameter j but different normalized charges, and the profiles are richly diverse. Because of the existence of a conserved scalar charge, Q, these solutions are non-unique in the (M,J) parameter space. Furthermore, Q cannot be extracted asymptotically from the metric functions. Nevertheless, by constraining the parameters through different observations, the luminosity profile could in turn be used to constrain the Noether charge and characterize the spacetime, should KBHsSH exist.

title: The Physics of Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Di Xiao, Fayin Wang, Zigao Dai
topic: In 2007, a very bright radio pulse was identified in the archival data of the Parkes Telescope in Australia, marking the beginning of a new research branch in astrophysics. In 2013, this kind of millisecond bursts with extremely high brightness temperature takes a unified name, fast radio burst (FRB). Over the first few years, FRBs seemed very mysterious because the sample of known events was limited. With the improvement of instruments over the last five years, hundreds of new FRBs have been discovered. The field is now undergoing a revolution and understanding of FRB has rapidly increased as new observational data increasingly accumulates. In this review, we will summarize the basic physics of FRBs and discuss the current research progress in this area. We have tried to cover a wide range of FRB topics, including the observational property, propagation effect, population study, radiation mechanism, source model, and application in cosmology. A framework based on the latest observational facts is now under construction. In the near future, this exciting field is expected to make significant breakthroughs.

title: Temperature dependent appearance of exotic matter makes nascent neutron stars spin faster
authors: Francisco Hernandez-Vivanco, Paul D. Lasky, Eric Thrane, Rory Smith, Debarati Chatterjee, Sarmistha Banik, Theo Motta, Anthony Thomas
topic: Neutron stars offer the opportunity to study the behaviour of matter at densities and temperatures inaccessible to terrestrial experiments. Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star coalescences can constrain the neutron-star equation of state before and after merger. After the neutron star binary merges, hyperons can form in the remnant, changing the behaviour of the neutron-star equation of state. In this study, we use finite-entropy equations of state to show that a post-merger remnant can spin up due to cooling. The magnitude of the spin-up depends on the neutron-star equation of state. If hyperons are present, the post-merger spin-up changes the peak gravitational-wave frequency by ~540 Hz, when the entropy per baryon drops from s=2 kB to s=0 kB. If hyperons are not present, the post-merger spin-up changes by ~360 Hz, providing a gravitational-wave signature for exotic matter. We expect the same qualitative behaviour whenever temperature dependent phase transitions are triggered.

title: Rotating vector model for magnetars
authors: H. Tong, P. F. Wang, H. G. Wang, Z. Yan
topic: The modification of the rotating vector model in the case of magnetars are calculated. Magnetars may have twisted magnetic field compared with normal pulsars. The polarization position angle of magnetars will change in the case of a twisted magnetic field. For a twisted dipole field, we found that the position angle will change both vertically and horizontally. During the untwisting process of the magnetar magnetosphere, the modifications of the position angle will evolve with time monotonously. This may explain the evolution of the position angle in magnetar PSR J1622-4950 and XTE J1810-197. The relation between the emission point and the line of sight will also change. We suggest every magnetospheric models of magnetars also calculate the corresponding changes of position angle in their models. Order of magnitude estimation formula for doing this is given. This opens the possibility to extract the magnetic field geometry of magnetars from their radio polarization observations.

title: Testing High-latitude Curvature Effect of Gamma-Ray Bursts with {\it Fermi} Data: Evidence of Bulk Acceleration in Prompt Emission
authors: Liang Li, Bing Zhang
topic: When a GRB emitter stops emission abruptly, the observer would receive rapidly fading emission from high latitudes with respect to the line of sight, known as the "curvature effect". Identifying such emission from GRB prompt emission lightcurves would constrain the radius of prompt emission from the central engine and the composition of GRB jets. We perform a dedicated search of high-latitude emission (HLE) through spectral and temporal analyses of a sample of single-pulse bursts detected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on-board the {\it Fermi} satellite. We identify HLE from a sub-sample of bursts and constrain the emission radius to be RGRB~(1015−1016) cm from the central engine. Some bursts have the HLE decays faster than predicted by a constant Lorentz factor jet, suggesting that the emission region is undergoing acceleration during prompt emission. This supports the Poynting-flux-dominated jet composition for these bursts. The conclusion is consistent with previous results drawn from spectral-lag modeling of prompt emission and HLE analysis of X-ray flares.

title: Delta-admixed neutron stars: spinodal instabilities and dUrca processes
authors: Adriana R. Raduta
topic: Within the covariant density functional theory of nuclear matter we build equations of state of Δ-admixed compact stars. Uncertainties in the interaction of Delta(1232) resonance states with nuclear matter, due to lack of experimental data, are accounted for by varying the coupling constants to scalar and vector mesonic fields. We find that, over a wide range of the parameter space allowed by nuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations, cold catalyzed star matter exhibits a first order phase transition which persists also at finite temperature and out of beta-equilibrium in the neutrino-transparent matter. Compact stars featuring such a phase transition in the outer core have small radii and, implicitly, tidal deformabilities. The parameter space is identified where simultaneously Delta-admixed compact stars obey the astrophysical constraint on maximum mass and allow for dUrca processes, which is otherwise forbidden.

title: An intuitive parametric model for 3D compressible hydrodynamical and MHD turbulence
authors: J.-B. Durrive, K. Ferrière, P. Lesaffre
topic: An analytical model for three-dimensional incompressible turbulence was recently introduced in the hydrodynamics community which, with only a few parameters, shares many properties of experimental and numerical turbulence, notably intermittency (non-Gaussianity), the energy cascade (skewness), and vorticity alignment properties. In view of modeling astrophysical environments, we introduce a manner to extend to compressible fluids the three-dimensional turbulent velocity field model of Chevillard et al. (2010), as well as the three 3D turbulent magnetic field models of Durrive et al. (2020), following the same procedure based on the concept of multiplicative chaos. Our model provides a complementary tool to numerical simulations, as it enables us to generate very quickly fairly realistic velocity fields and magnetic fields, the statistics of which are controllable with intuitive parameters. Therefore our model will also provide a useful tool for observers in astrophysics. Finally, maybe even more than the model itself, it is the very procedure that matters the most: our model is modular, in the sense that it is constructed gradually, with intuitive and physically motivated steps, so that it is prone to many further improvements.

title: Implications of PREX-II on the equation of state of neutron-rich matter
authors: Brendan T. Reed, F. J. Fattoyev, C. J. Horowitz, J. Piekarewicz
topic: Laboratory experiments sensitive to the equation of state of neutron rich matter in the vicinity of nuclear saturation density provide the first rung in a "density ladder" that connects terrestrial experiments to astronomical observations. In this context, the neutron skin thickness of 208Pb (Rskin) provides the most stringent laboratory constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In turn, the cleanest and most precise value of Rskin has been reported recently by the PREX collaboration. Exploiting the strong correlation between Rskin and the slope of the symmetry energy (L) we report a value of L=(109.56 +/- 36.41)MeV -- that systematically overestimates current limits based on both theoretical approaches and experimental measurements. The impact of such a stiff symmetry energy on some critical neutron-star observables is also examined.

title: Estimating the Neutrino Flux from Choked Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Michela Fasano, Silvia Celli, Dafne Guetta, Antonio Capone, Angela Zegarelli, Irene Di Palma
topic: The strong constraints from the Fermi-LAT data on the isotropic gamma-ray background suggest that the neutrinos observed by IceCube might possibly come from sources that are hidden to gamma-ray observations. A possibility recently discussed in the literature is that neutrinos may come from jets of collapsing massive stars which fail to break out of the stellar envelope, and for this reason they are also known as choked jets. In this paper, we estimate the neutrino flux and spectrum expected from these sources. We perform detailed calculations of p-gamma interactions, accounting for all the neutrino production channels and scattering angles. We provide predictions of expected event rates for operating neutrino telescopes, as ANTARES and IceCube, as well as for future generation telescopes as KM3NeT. We find that if 10%-100% of the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) energy is channeled into protons, choked GRBs may reproduce the observed astrophysical neutrino flux, if their local rate is 3-0.3 Gpc^(-3) yr^(-1). This rate is consistent with the rate of GRBs detected in gamma rays.

topic: The discovery of GW170817 and GRB 170817A in tandem with AT 2017gfo cemented the connection between neutron star mergers, short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and kilonovae. To investigate short GRB observations in the context of diverse kilonova behavior, we present a comprehensive optical and near-infrared (NIR) catalog of 85 bursts discovered over 2005-2020 on timescales of less 12 days. The sample includes previously unpublished observations of 23 bursts, and encompasses both detections and deep upper limits. We identify 11.8% and 15.3% of short GRBs in our catalog with upper limits that probe luminosities lower than those of AT 2017gfo and a fiducial NSBH kilonovae model (for pole-on orientations), respectively. We quantify the ejecta masses allowed by the deepest limits in our catalog, constraining blue and `extremely blue' kilonova components of 14.1% of bursts to Mej less 0.01-0.1Msun. The sample of short GRBs is not particularly constraining for red kilonova components. Motivated by the large catalog as well as model predictions of diverse kilonova behavior, we investigate altered search strategies for future follow-up to short GRBs. We find that ground-based optical and NIR observations on timescales of \geq 2 days can play a significant role in constraining more diverse outcomes. We expect future short GRB follow up efforts, such as from the {\it James Webb Space Telescope}, to expand the reach of kilonova detectability to redshifts of z=1.

title: A numerical jet model for the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts
authors: Ruben Farinelli, Rupal Basak, Lorenzo Amati, Cristiano Guidorzi, Filippo Frontera
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are known to be highly collimated events, and are mostly detectable when they are seen on-axis or very nearly on-axis. However, GRBs can be seen from off-axis angles, and the recent detection of a short GRB associated to a gravitational wave event has conclusively shown such a scenario. The observer viewing angle plays an important role in the observable spectral shape and the energetic of such events. We present a numerical model which is based on the single-pulse approximation with emission from a top-hat jet and has been developed to investigate the effects of the observer viewing angle. We assume a conical jet parametrized by a radius Rjet, half-opening angle θjet, a comoving-frame emissivity law and an observer viewing angle θobs, and then study the effects for the conditions θobs<θjet and θobs>θjet. We present results considering a smoothly broken power-law emissivity law in jet comoving frame, albeit the model implementation easily allows to consider other emissivity laws. We find that the relation Eip propto E0.5iso (Amati relation) is naturally obtained from pure relativistic kinematic when Gamma > 10 and θobs<θjet; on the contrary, when θobs>θjet it results Eip prop to E0.25iso. Using data from literature for a class of well-know sub-energetic GRBs, we show that their position in the Eip-Eiso plane is consistent with event observed off-axis. The presented model is developed as a module to be integrated in spectral fitting software package XSPEC and can be used by the scientific community.

title: Modeling particle transport in astrophysical outflows and simulations of associated emissions
authors: D. A. Papadopoulos, O. T. Kosmas, S. Ganatsios
topic: In this work, after making an attempt to improve the formulation of the model on particle transport within astrophysical plasma outflows and constructing the appropriate algorithms, we test the reliability and effectiveness of our method through numerical simulations on well-studied Galactic microquasars as the SS 433 and the Cyg X-1 systems. Then, we concentrate on predictions of the associated emissions, focusing on detectable high energy neutrinos and gamma-rays originated from the extra-galactic M33 X-7 system, which is a recently discovered X-ray binary located in the neighboring galaxy Messier 33 and has not yet been modeled in detail. The particle and radiation energy distributions, produced from magnetized astrophysical jets in the context of our method, are assumed to originate from decay and scattering processes taking place among the secondary particles created when hot (relativistic) protons of the jet scatter on thermal (cold) ones (p-p interaction mechanism inside the jet). These distributions are computed by solving the system of coupled integro-differential transport equations of multi-particle processes (reactions chain) following the inelastic proton-proton (p-p) collisions. For the detection of such high energy neutrinos as well as multi-wavelength (radio, X-ray and gamma-ray) emissions, extremely sensitive detection instruments are in operation or have been designed like the CTA, IceCube, ANTARES, KM3NeT, IceCube-Gen-2, and other space telescopes.

title: Synthesis of radioactive elements in novae and supernovae and their use as a diagnostic tool
authors: J. Isern, M. Hernanz, E. Bravo, S. Grebenev, P. Jean, M. Renaud, T. Siegert, J. Vink
topic: Novae and supernovae play a key role in many fields of Astrophysics and Cosmology. Despite their importance, an accurate description of which objects explode and why and how they explode is still lacking. One of the main characteristics of such explosions is that they are the main suppliers of newly synthesized chemical elements in the Galaxy. Since some of these isotopes are radioactive, it is possible to use the corresponding gamma-rays as a diagnostic tool of the explosion thanks to their independence on the thermal state of the debris. The drawback is the poor sensitivity of detectors in the MeV energy domain. As a consequence, the radioactive lines have only been detected in one core collapse supernova (SN 1987A), one Type Ia supernova (SN 2014J), and one supernova remnant (Cas A). Nevertheless these observations have provided and are providing important information about the explosion mechanisms. Unfortunately, novae are still eluding detection. These results emphasize the necessity to place as soon as possible a new instrument in orbit with enough sensitivity to noticeably enlarge the sample of detected events

title: Mass ejection in failed supernovae: equation of state and neutrino loss dependence
authors: Mario Ivanov, Rodrigo Fernández
topic: A failed core-collapse supernova from a non-rotating progenitor can eject mass due to a weakening of gravity associated to neutrino emission by the protoneutron star. This mechanism yields observable transients and sets an upper limit to the mass of the black hole (BH) remnant. Previous global simulations of this mechanism have included neutrino losses parametrically, however, with direct implications for the ejecta mass and energy. Here we evolve the inner supernova core with a spherically-symmetric, general-relativistic neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic code until BH formation. We then use the result in a Newtonian code that follows the response of the outer layers of the star to the change in gravity and resolves the surface pressure scale height. We find that the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) can introduce a factor ~2 variation in gravitational mass lost to neutrinos, with a stiff EOS matching previous parametric results, and a soft EOS yielding lower ejecta masses and energies by a factor of several. This difference is caused primarily by the longer time to BH formation in stiffer EOSs. With a soft EOS, our red and yellow supergiant progenitors fail to unbind mass if hydrogen recombination energy is not included. Using a linear ramp in time for mass-energy lost to neutrinos (with suitable parameters) yields a stellar response within ~10% of that obtained using the detailed history of neutrino losses. Our results imply quantitative but not qualitative modifications to previous predictions for shock breakout, plateau emission, and final BH masses from these events.

title: GW170817 and GW190814: tension on the maximum mass
authors: Antonios Nathanail, Elias R. Most, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: The detection of the binary events GW170817 and GW190814 has provided invaluable constraints on the maximum mass of nonrotating configurations of neutron stars, MTOV. However, the large differences in the neutron-star masses measured in GW170817 and GW190814 has also lead to a significant tension between the predictions for such maximum masses, with GW170817 suggesting that MTOV less 2.3Msun, and GW190814 requiring MTOV larger 2.5Msun if the secondary was a (non- or slowly rotating) neutron star at merger. Using a genetic algorithm, we sample the multidimensional space of parameters spanned by gravitational-wave and astronomical observations associated with GW170817. Consistent with previous estimates, we find that all of the physical quantities are in agreement with the observations if the maximum mass is in the range MTOV=2.210+0.116-0.123Msun within a 2-sigma confidence level. By contrast, maximum masses with MTOVlarger 2.5Msun, not only require efficiencies in the gravitational-wave emission that are well above the numerical-relativity estimates, but they also lead to a significant under-production of the ejected mass. Hence, the tension can be released by assuming that the secondary in GW190814 was a black hole at merger, although it could have been a rotating neutron star before.

title: Two-Component Advective Flows around Neutron Stars
authors: Ayan Bhattacharjee, Sandip K. Chakrabarti
topic: The fundamental difference between accretion around black holes and neutron stars is the inner boundary condition, which affects the behavior of matter very close to the compact objects. This leads to formation of additional shocks and boundary layers for neutron stars. Previous studies on the formation of such boundary layers focused on Keplerian flows that reached the surface of the star, either directly or through the formation of a transition layer. However, behavior of sub-Keplerian matter near the surface of a neutron star has not been studied in detail. Here, we study the effect of viscosity, in presence of cooling, on the sub-Keplerian flows around neutron stars, using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Our time-dependent study shows that multiple shocks, transition and boundary layers form in such type of accretion, when viscosity is significant, and one or more layers are absent when the viscosity is moderate. These flows are particularly of interest for the wind dominated systems such as Cir X-1. We also report the formation of a generalized flow configuration, Two-Component Advective Flow, for the first time.

authors: Matteo Breschi, Albino Perego, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Walter Del Pozzo, Vsevolod Nedora, David Radice, Diego Vescovi
topic: The joint detection of the gravitational wave GW170817, of the short gamma-ray burst GRB170817A and of the kilonova AT2017gfo, generated by the the binary neutron star merger observed on August 17, 2017, is a milestone in multimessenger astronomy and provides new constraints on the neutron star equation of state. We perform Bayesian inference and model selection on AT2017gfo using semi-analytical, multi-components models that also account for non-spherical ejecta. Observational data favor anisotropic geometries to spherically symmetric profiles, with a log-Bayes' factor of 104, and favor multi-component models against single-component ones. The best fitting model is an anisotropic three-component composed of dynamical ejecta plus neutrino and viscous winds. Using the dynamical ejecta parameters inferred from the best-fitting model and numerical-relativity connecting the ejecta properties ot the binary properties, we constrain the binary mass ratio to q less 1.54 and the reduced tidal parameter to 120 les Λ less 1110. Finally, we combine the predictions from AT2017gfo with those from GW170817, constraining the radius of a neutron star of 1.4 Msun to 12.2pm0.5 km (1sigma level). This prediction could be further strengthened by improving kilonova models with numerical-relativity information.

title: Modeling compact binary signals and instrumental glitches in gravitational wave data
authors: Katerina Chatziioannou, Neil Cornish, Marcella Wijngaarden, Tyson B. Littenberg
topic: Transient non-gaussian noise in gravitational wave detectors, commonly referred to as glitches, pose challenges for inference of the astrophysical properties of detected signals when the two are coincident in time. Current analyses aim towards modeling and subtracting the glitches from the data using a flexible, morphology-independent model in terms of sine-gaussian wavelets before the signal source properties are inferred using templates for the compact binary signal. We present a new analysis of gravitational wave data that contain both a signal and glitches by simultaneously modeling the compact binary signal in terms of templates and the instrumental glitches using sine-gaussian wavelets. The model for the glitches is generic and can thus be applied to a wide range of glitch morphologies without any special tuning. The simultaneous modeling of the astrophysical signal with templates allows us to efficiently separate the signal from the glitches, as we demonstrate using simulated signals injected around real O2 glitches in the two LIGO detectors. We show that our new proposed analysis can separate overlapping glitches and signals, estimate the compact binary parameters, and provide ready-to-use glitch-subtracted data for downstream inference analyses.

authors: Takayuki Ohgami, Nozomu Tominaga, Yousuke Utsumi, Yuu Niino, et al
topic: A gravitational wave event, S190510g, which was classified as a binary-neutron-star coalescence at the time of preliminary alert, was detected by LIGO/Virgo collaboration on May 10, 2019. At 1.7 hours after the issue of its preliminary alert, we started a target-of-opportunity imaging observation in gamma-band to search for its optical counterpart using the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru Telescope. We found three candidates are likely located inside the 3D skymap and concluded they could be an counterpart of S190510g, while most of 133 candidates were likely to be supernovae because the number density of candidates was consistent with the expected number of supernova detections. By comparing our observational depth with a light curve model of such a kilonova reproducing AT2017gfo, we show that early-deep observations with the Subaru/HSC can capture the rising phase of blue component of kilonova at the estimated distance of S190510g (~230 Mpc).

title: Studying the onset of deconfinement with multi-messenger astronomy of neutron stars
authors: David Blaschke, Mateusz Cierniak
topic: With the first multi-messenger observation of a binary neutron star merger (GW170817) new constraints became available for masses and radii of neutron stars. We introduce a class of hybrid EoS that fulfils all these constraints and predicts a region in the mass-radius diagram that could be populated only by hybrid neutron stars with quark matter cores. A confirmation of this conjecture would be provided when the NICER radius measurement for the high-mass pulsar PSR J0740+6620 yields a radius less than 11 km. Would this radius measurement yield a result in excess of 12 km, this would allow for both, a purely hadronic and a hybrid nature of this star. In the latter case the maximum mass could reach 2.6 Msun so that the lighter object in the asymmetric binary merger GW190814 could have been a hybrid star. We demonstrate that this high mass can be compatible with an early onset of deconfinement at star masses below 1 Msun and the occurrence of low-mass twin stars. In such a case the remnant of GW170817 could be a long-lived hypermassive pulsar.

title: Testing the general theory of relativity using gravitational wave propagation from dark standard sirens
authors: Suvodip Mukherjee, Benjamin D. Wandelt, Joseph Silk
topic: Alternative theories of gravity predict modifications in the propagation of gravitational waves (GW) through space-time. One of the smoking-gun predictions of such theories is the change in the GW luminosity distance to GW sources as a function of redshift relative to the electromagnetic (EM) luminosity distance expected from EM probes. We propose a multi-messenger test of the theory of general relativity from the propagation of gravitational waves by combining EM and GW observations to resolve these issues from GW sources without EM counterparts (which are also referred to as dark standard sirens). By using the relation between the geometric distances accessible from baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and luminosity distance measurements from the GW sources, we can measure any deviation from the general theory of relativity via the GW sources of unknown redshift that will be detectable by networks of GW detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. Using this technique, the fiducial value of the frictional term can be measured to a precision 0=0.98+0.04−0.23 after marginalizing over redshift dependence, cosmological parameters, and GW bias parameters with 3500 dark standard sirens of masses 30msun each distributed up to redshift z=0.5. For a fixed redshift dependence, a value of 0=0.99+0.02−0.02 can be measured with a similar number of dark sirens. Application of our methodology to the far more numerous dark standard sirens detectable with next generation GW detectors, such as LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will allow achievement of higher accuracy than possible from use of bright standard sirens.

title: Non-linear diffusive shock acceleration: A recipe for injection of electrons
authors: Bojan Arbutina, Vladimir Zeković
topic: Prescriptions for electron injection into the diffusive shock acceleration process are required in many practical considerations of cosmic-ray astrophysics, particularly in modeling of the synchrotron emission of astrophysical sources. In particle-in-cell simulations of quasi-parallel magnetized collisionless shocks, we analyse the evolution of particle spectra. We find that in the later stages of shock evolution, the initially strong suprathermal part in the ion spectra fades, thus leaving the spectra composed of a Maxwellian and a power law. Once the electron and ion spectra flatten and become parallel, we find that the amounts of cosmic ray ions and electrons become similar. We make the step towards relating the micro and macro-scale physics by applying this injection rule to Blasi's semi-analytical model of non-linear diffusive shock acceleration, in order to obtain the particle spectra and electron-to-proton ratio Kep at high energies. By using shock jump conditions that include the electron heating, we find Kep as a function of Mach number. For Mach number 100, our model finely reproduces the typically observed ratio for Galactic cosmic-rays Kep 1:100 in the test particle regime.

title: Magnetically Ejected Disks: Equatorial Outflows Near Vertically Magnetized Black Hole
authors: Vladimir Karas, Kostas Sapountzis, Agnieszka Janiuk
topic: Black holes attract gaseous material from the surrounding environment. Cosmic plasma is largely ionized and magnetized because of electric currents flowing in the highly conductive environment near black holes; the process of accretion then carries the magnetic flux onto the event horizon, r=R+. On the other hand, magnetic pressure acts against accretion. It can not only arrest the inflow but it can even push the plasma away from the black hole if the magnetic repulsion prevails. The black hole does not hold the magnetic field by itself.
In this contribution we show an example of an equatorial outflow driven by a large scale magnetic field. We initiate our computations with a spherically symmetric distribution of gas, which flows onto the domain from a large distance, r\ggR+. After the flow settles in a steady (Bondi) solution, we impose an axially symmetric configuration of a uniform (Wald) magnetic field aligned with the rotation axis of the black hole. Then we evolve the initial configuration numerically by employing the MHD code that approaches the force-free limit of a perfectly conducting fluid.
We observe how the magnetic lines of force start accreting with the plasma while an equatorial intermittent outflow develops and goes on ejecting some material away from the black hole.

title: A low-mass binary neutron star: long-term ejecta evolution and kilonovae with weak blue emission
authors: Kyohei Kawaguchi, Sho Fujibayashi, Masaru Shibata, Masaomi Tanaka, Shinya Wanajo
topic: We study the long-term evolution of ejecta formed in a binary neutron star (BNS) merger that results in a long-lived remnant NS by performing a hydrodynamics simulation with the outflow data of a numerical relativity simulation as the initial condition. At the homologously expanding phase, the total ejecta mass reaches =0.1Msun with an average velocity of =0.1c and lanthanide fraction of 0.005. We further perform the radiative transfer simulation employing the obtained ejecta profile. We find that, contrary to a naive expectation from the large ejecta mass and low lanthanide fraction, the optical emission is not as bright as that in GW170817/AT2017gfo, while the infrared emission can be brighter. This light curve property is attributed to preferential diffusion of photons toward the equatorial direction due to the prolate ejecta morphology, large opacity contribution of Zr, Y, and lanthanides, and low specific heating rate of the ejecta. Our results suggest that these light curve features could be used as an indicator for the presence of a long-lived remnant NS. We also found that the bright optical emission broadly consistent with GW170817/AT2017gfo is realized for the case that the high-velocity ejecta components in the polar region are suppressed. These results suggest that the remnant in GW170817/AT2017gfo is unlikely to be a long-lived NS, but might have collapsed to a black hole within O(0.1) s.

title: A Unified Spectral Model for Accreting Neutron Stars
authors: Ayan Bhattacharjee, Sandip K. Chakrabarti
topic: Recent studies show that accretion flows around weakly magnetic Neutron Stars undergo multiple shocks, before reaching the surface of the star, which contribute to the spectral and timing variabilities observed in the X-Rays. Here, we report, for the first time, the spectral properties of a unified model of shocked accretion flows around Neutron Stars, based on the Two-Component Advective Flow paradigm. We compare our theoretical results with the X-Ray spectral features of Z and Atoll sources, across different states. We also fit RXTE/PCA spectra of Sco X-1 and 4U 1705-44 to show the potential application of this new model.

title: What role will binary neutron star merger afterglows play in multimessenger cosmology?
authors: S. Mastrogiovanni, R. Duque, E. Chassande-Mottin, F. Daigne, R.Mochkovitch
topic: Binary neutron star mergers offer a new and independent means of measuring the Hubble constant H0 by combining the gravitational-wave inferred source luminosity distance with its redshift obtained from electromagnetic follow-up. This method is limited by intrinsic degeneracy between the system distance and orbital inclination in the gravitational-wave signal. Observing the afterglow counterpart to a merger can further constrain the inclination angle, allowing this degeneracy to be partially lifted and improving the measurement of H0. In the case of the binary neutron star merger GW170817, afterglow light-curve and imagery modeling thus allowed to improve the H0 measurement by a factor of 3. However, systematic access to afterglow data is far from guaranteed. In fact, though each one allows a leap in H0 precision, these afterglow counterparts should prove rare in forthcoming multimessenger campaigns. We combine models for emission and detection of gravitational-wave and electromagnetic radiation from binary neutron star mergers with realistic population models and estimates for afterglow inclination angle constraints. Using these models, we quantify how fast H0 will be narrowed-down by successive multimessenger events with and without the afterglow. We find that, because of its rareness and though it greatly refines angle estimates, the afterglow counterpart should not significantly contribute to the measurement of H0 in the long run.

title: Testing Blandford-Znajek mechanism in black hole hyperaccretion flows for long-duration gamma-ray bursts
authors: Mei Du, Shuang-Xi Yi, Tong Liu, Cui-Ying Song, Wei Xie
topic: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally related to the core-collapse of massive stars. In the collapsar scenario, a rotating stellar-mass black hole (BH) surrounded by a hyperaccretion disk has been considered as one of the plausible candidates of GRB central engines. In this paper, we work on a sample including 146 long GRBs with significant jet break features in the multi-band afterglows. The jet opening angles can be then obtained by the jet break time. By asumming GRB jets powered by Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism in the BH hyperaccretion system, we analyze the distributions of the long GRB luminosities and durations in the samples, and constrain the accretion rates for the different BH spins. As the results, we find that the BZ mechanism is so powerful making it possible to interpret the long GRB prompt emissions within the reasonably accretion rates.

title: Updated universal relations for tidal deformabilities of neutron stars from phenomenological equations of state
authors: Daniel A. Godzieba, Rossella Gamba, David Radice, Sebastiano Bernuzzi
topic: Equation of state (EOS) insensitive relations, so-called universal relations, between the neutron star (NS) compactness, its multipolar tidal deformability coefficients, and between the tidal parameters for binary systems are essential to break degeneracies in gravitational wave data analysis. Here, we validate and recalibrate these universal relations using a large set of almost 2 million phenomenological EOSs that are consistent with current observations. In doing so, we extend universal relations to a larger region of the EOS parameter space, most notably to softer EOSs and larger compactnesses. We show that waveform models that neglect higher-than-leading-order tidal deformations of the NSs accumulate as much as 3.5 radians of dephasing from 20Hz to merger. We also perform a full Bayesian parameter estimation of the GW170817 data, and we compare the NS radius constraints produced using universal relations from the literature and the updated fits we propose here. We find that the new fits yield a NS radius that is smaller by about 500 meters. This difference is less than the statistical uncertainty on the radius at the signal-to-noise-ratio of GW170817, but it is significantly larger than the precision anticipated for next-generation detectors.

title: Effect of acceleration and escape of energetic particles on spectral steepening at shocks
authors: Federico Fraschetti
topic: Energetic particles spectra at interplanetary shocks often exhibit a power law within a narrow momentum range softening at higher energy. We introduce a transport equation accounting for particle acceleration and escape with diffusion contributed by self-generated turbulence close to the shock and by pre-existing turbulence far upstream. The upstream particle intensity steepens within one diffusion length from the shock as compared with diffusive shock acceleration rollover. The momentum spectrum, controlled by macroscopic parameters such as shock compression, speed, far upstream diffusion coefficient and escape time at the shock, can be reduced to a log-parabola and also to a broken power law. In the case of upstream uniform diffusion coefficient, the largely used power law/exponential cut off solution is retrieved.

title: Giant X-ray and optical Bump in GRBs: evidence for fall-back accretion model
authors: Litao Zhao, He Gao, WeiHua Lei, Lin Lan, Liangduan Liu
topic: The successful operation of dedicated detectors has brought us valuable information for understanding the central engine and the progenitor of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For instance, the giant X-ray and optical bumps found in some long-duration GRBs (e.g. GRBs 121027A and 111209A) imply that some extended central engine activities, such as the late X-ray flares, are likely due to the fall-back of progenitor envelope materials. Here we systemically search for long GRBs that consist of a giant X-ray or optical bump from the Swift GRB sample, and eventually we find 19 new possible candidates. The fall-back accretion model could well interpret the X-ray and optical bump for all candidates within a reasonable parameter space. Six candidates showing simultaneous bump signatures in both X-ray and optical observations, which could be well fitted at the same time when scaling down the X-ray flux into optical by one order of magnitude, are consistent with the standard synchrotron spectrum. The typical fall-back radius is distributed around 1010-1012 cm, which is consistent with the typical radius of a Wolf-Rayet star. The peak fall-back accretion rate is in the range of ~10-11-10-4Msun s−1 at time ~102-105 s, which is relatively easy to fulfill as long as the progenitor's metallicity is not too high. Combined with the sample we found, future studies of the mass supply rate for the progenitors with different mass, metallicity, and angular momentum distribution would help us to better constrain the progenitor properties of long GRBs.

title: Compact Dark Objects in Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Andreas Bauswein, Gang Guo, Jr-Hua Lien, Yen-Hsun Lin, Meng-Ru Wu
topic: We estimate the long-lasting gravitational wave (GW) emission of compact dark objects following a binary neutron-star (NS) merger. We consider compact dark objects, which initially reside in the centers of NSs and which may consist of self-interacting dark matter (DM). By approximating the compact dark objects as test particles, we model the merging of NS binaries hosting DM components with three-dimensional relativistic simulations. Our simulation results suggest that the DM components remain gravitationally bound and orbit inside the merger remnant with orbital separations of typically a few km. The subsequent orbital motion of the DM components generates a GW signal with frequencies in the range of a few kHz. When considering a range of different binary masses and high-density equations of state (EoS), we find that the GW frequency of the orbiting DM components scales with the compactness of NSs. Similarly, we find relations between the DM GW frequency and the dominant postmerger GW frequency of the stellar fluid or the tidal deformability, which quantifies EoS effects during the binary inspiral. Hence, a measurement of these quantities can be used to specify the frequency range of the GW emission by DM. Under the assumption that GW back reaction is the only relevant dissipative process, the GW signal may last between seconds and years depending on the mass of the DM component. We estimate the detectability of the GW signals and find that DM components in NS mergers may only be detectable with existing and projected GW instruments if the dark objects are as massive as about 0.01 to 0.1 M_sun. We emphasize that the GW emission is limited by the lifetime of the remnant. A forming black hole will immediately swallow the DM objects because their orbits are smaller than the innermost stable circular orbit of the black hole.

title: An adaptive mesh, GPU-accelerated, and error minimized special relativistic hydrodynamics code
authors: Po-Hsun Tseng, Hsi-Yu Schive, Tzihong Chiueh
topic: We present a new special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD) code capable of handling coexisting ultra-relativistically hot and non-relativistically cold gases. We achieve this by designing a new algorithm for conversion between primitive and conserved variables in the SRHD solver, which incorporates a realistic ideal-gas equation of state covering both the relativistic and non-relativistic regimes. The code can handle problems involving a Lorentz factor as high as 10to6 and optimally avoid the catastrophic cancellation. In addition, we have integrated this new SRHD solver into the code GAMER (this https URL) to support adaptive mesh refinement and hybrid OpenMP/MPI/GPU parallelization. It achieves a peak performance of 7-10to7 cell updates per second on a single Tesla P100 GPU and scales well to 2048 GPUs. We apply this code to two interesting astrophysical applications: (a) an asymmetric explosion source on the relativistic blast wave and (b) the flow acceleration and limb-brightening of relativistic jets.

title: The Mysterious Magnetospheres of Magnetars
authors: Matthew G. Baring, Zorawar Wadiasingh, Peter L. Gonthier, Alice K. Harding, Kun Hu
topic: Magnetars are the most luminous compact objects in the stellar mass range observed in the Milky Way, with giant flares of hard X-ray power ~10^45 erg/sec being detected from three soft gamma repeaters in the Galactic neighborhood. Periodicity seen in magnetar persistent emission, and a distinctive "spin-down" lengthening of this period, have driven the paradigm that strongly-magnetized neutron stars constitute these fascinating sources. The steady X-ray emission includes both thermal atmospheric components, and magnetospheric contributions that are manifested as hard X-ray "tails." This paper addresses observational and theoretical elements pertinent to the steady hard X-ray emission of magnetars, focusing on dissipative processes in their magnetospheres, and elements of Comptonization and polarization. It also discusses the action and possible signatures of the exotic and fundamental QED mechanisms of photon splitting and magnetic pair creation, and the quest for their observational vindication.

title: Three-dimensional modelling of accretion columns: spatial asymmetry and self-consistent simulations
authors: M. I. Gornostaev
topic: The paper presents the results of three-dimensional (3D) modelling of the structure and the emission of accretion columns formed above the surface of accreting strongly magnetized neutron stars under the circumstances when a pressure of the photons generated in the column base is enough to determine the dynamics of the plasma flow. On the foundation of numerical radiation hydrodynamic simulations, several 3D models of accretion column are constructed. The first group of the models contains spatially 3D columns. The corresponding calculations lead to the distributions of the radiation flux over the sidewalls of the columns which are not characterized by axial symmetry. The second group includes the self-consistent modelling of spectral radiative transfer and two-dimensional spatial structure of the column, with both thermal and bulk Comptonization taken into account. The changes in the structure of the column and the shape of X-ray continuum are investigated depending on physical parameters of the model.

title: Progress in Understanding the Enigmatic Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Shami Chatterjee
topic: In less than a decade, fast radio bursts have gone from a single debated curiosity to a diverse extragalactic population with established host galaxies and energy scales. While a wide range of models remain viable, the central engines of FRBs are likely to involve energetic young magnetars, as confirmed by the recent discovery of a Galactic analog to these extragalactic bursts. Here we provide a brief introductory review of fast radio bursts, focusing on the rapid recent progress in observations of these enigmatic events, our understanding of their central engines, and their use as probes of the intergalactic medium. We caution against a rush to judgement on the mechanisms and classification of all FRBs: at this point, it remains plausible that there could be one dominant central engine, as well as the possibility that radio bursts are a generic feature produced by many different mechanisms. We also emphasize the importance of improved modeling of our Galaxy and Galactic halo, which otherwise impose systematic errors on every FRB line of sight. The future of science with fast radio bursts appears bright.

title: Resonant Shattering Flares as Multimessenger Probes of the Nuclear Symmetry Energy
authors: Duncan Neill, William G. Newton, David Tsang
topic: The behaviour of the nuclear symmetry energy near saturation density is important for our understanding of dense nuclear matter. This density dependence can be parameterised by the nuclear symmetry energy and its derivatives evaluated at nuclear saturation density. In this work, we show that the core-crust interface mode of a neutron star is sensitive to these parameters, through the (density-weighted) shear-speed within the crust, which is in turn dependent on the symmetry energy profile of dense matter. We calculate the frequency at which the neutron star quadrupole (l=2) crust-core interface mode must be driven by the tidal field of its binary partner to trigger a Resonant Shattering Flare (RSF). We demonstrate that coincident multimessenger timing of a RSF and gravitational wave chirp from a neutron star merger would enable us to place strong constraints on the symmetry energy parameters, competitive with those from current nuclear experiments.

title: Broadband Modelling of Orphan Gamma Ray Flares
authors: S. R. Patel, D. Bose, N. Gupta, M. Zuberi
topic: Blazars, a class of highly variable active galactic nuclei, sometimes exhibit Orphan gamma-ray flares. These flares having high flux only in gamma-ray energies do not show significant variations in flux at lower energies. We study the temporal and spectral profile of these Orphan gamma-ray flares in detail from three gamma−ray bright blazars, 3C 273, PKS 1510-089 and 3C 279 and also their simultaneous broadband emissions. We find that the variability timescales of the Orphan gamma-ray flares were (0.96 pm 0.28) days, (3.12 pm 2.40) hr and (2.16 pm 0.72) hr, for 3C 273, PKS 1510-089 and 3C 279, respectively. The broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) during these flares have been modelled with a leptonic model from two emission regions. This model suggests that Orphan gamma-ray flares might have originated from inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons by the seed photons from the broad-line region or dusty torus, which is the first region. While the second broader region, lying further down the jet, could be responsible for X-ray and radio emissions. The possible locations of these emission regions in the jets of the three sources have been estimated from SED modelling.

topic: We here present a new version of the publicly available general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code Spritz, which now includes an approximate neutrino leakage scheme able to handle neutrino cooling and heating. The leakage scheme is based on the publicly available ZelmaniLeak code, with a few modifications in order to properly work with Spritz. We discuss the involved equations, physical assumptions, and implemented numerical methods, along with a large battery of general relativistic tests performed with and without magnetic fields. Our tests demonstrate the correct implementation of the neutrino leakage scheme, paving the way for further improvements of our neutrino treatment and the first application to magnetized binary neutron star mergers. We also discuss the implementation in the Spritz code of high-order methods for a more accurate evolution of hydrodynamical quantities.

title: New equation of state involving Bose-Einstein condensate of antikaon for supernova and neutron star merger simulations
authors: Tuhin Malik, Sarmistha Banik, Debades Bandyopadhyay
topic: We compute a new equation of state table including Bose-Einstein condensate of K− mesons for core collapse supernova and neutron star merger simulations. Nuclei and interacting nucleons in non-uniform matter is described in an extended version of the nuclear statistical equilibrium model including excluded volume effects whereas the uniform matter at higher densities is treated in the relativistic hadron field theory with density dependent couplings. The equation of state table is generated for a wide range of density (10-12 to ~1 fm-3), positive charge fraction (0.01 to 0.60) and temperature (0.1 to 158.48 MeV). The impact of antikaon condensate is investigated on different thermodynamic quantities for example free energy per baryon, entropy per baryon, pressure as well as compositions of matter. Furthermore, critical temperatures of antikaon condensation and the phase diagram of matter are also studied in this article.

title: 2D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of supernova ejecta with a central power source
authors: Akihiro Suzuki, Keiichi Maeda
topic: We present the results of two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of expanding supernova ejecta with a central energy source. As suggested in previous multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, a sufficiently powerful central energy source can blow away the expanding supernova ejecta, leading to efficient mixing of stratified layers in the ejecta. We assume that the energy injection is realized in the form of non-thermal radiation from the wind nebula embedded at the center of the ejecta. We found that the multi-dimensional mixing in the ejecta assists the injected non-thermal radiation escaping from the ejecta. When the non-thermal radiation is absorbed by the ejecta, it is converted into bright thermal radiation or is consumed as the kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta. We found that central energy sources with the injection timescale similar to the photon diffusion timescale realize an efficient conversion of the injected energy into thermal radiation. On the other hand, a rapid energy injection ends up accelerating the ejecta rather than giving rise to bright thermal emission. This remarkable difference potentially explains the diversity of energetic supernovae including broad-lined Ic and superluminous supernovae.

title: GRB 180418A: A possibly-short GRB with a wide-angle outflow in a faint host galaxy
authors: Alicia Rouco Escorial, Wen-fai Fong, Peter Veres, Tanmoy Laskar et al
topic: We present X-ray and multi-band optical observations of the afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 180418A, discovered by Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM. We present a reanalysis of the GBM and BAT data deriving durations of the prompt emission of T90~2.56s and ~1.90s, respectively. Modeling the Fermi/GBM catalog of 1405 bursts (2008-2014) in the Hardness-T90 plane, we obtain a probability of ~60% that GRB 180418A is a short-hard burst. From a combination of Swift/XRT and Chandra observations, the X-ray afterglow is detected to ~38.5 days after the burst, and exhibits a single power-law decline with FX proportional to t^-0.98. Late-time Gemini observations reveal a faint r ~24.95 mag host galaxy at an angular offset of ~0.16''. At the likely redshift range of z ~1-1.5, we find that the X-ray afterglow luminosity of GRB 180418A is intermediate between short and long GRBs at all epochs during which there is contemporaneous data, and that GRB 180418A lies closer to the E({\gamma},peak)-E({\gamma},iso) correlation for short GRBs. Modeling the multi-wavelength afterglow with the standard synchrotron model, we derive the burst explosion properties and find a jet opening angle of {\theta}j =>9-14 degrees. If GRB 180418A is a short GRB that originated from a neutron star merger, it has one of the brightest and longest-lived afterglows along with an extremely faint host galaxy. If instead the event is a long GRB that originated from a massive star collapse, it has among the lowest luminosity afterglows, and lies in a peculiar space in terms of the Hardness-T90 and E({\gamma},peak)-E_({\gamma},iso) planes.

title: Dynamical Formation Scenarios for GW190521 and Prospects for Decihertz Gravitational-Wave Astronomy with GW190521-Like Binaries
authors: A. Miguel Holgado, Alexis Ortega, Carl L. Rodriguez
topic: The gravitational-wave (GW) detection of GW190521 has provided new insights on the mass distribution of black holes and new constraints for astrophysical formation channels. With independent claims of GW190521 having significant pre-merger eccentricity, we investigate what this implies for GW190521-like binaries that form dynamically. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will also be sensitive to GW190521-like binaries if they are circular from an isolated formation channel. We show, however, that GW190521-like binaries that form dynamically may skip the LISA band entirely. To this end, we simulate GW190521 analogues that dynamically form via post-Newtonian binary-single scattering. From these scattering experiments, we find that GW190521-like binaries may enter the LIGO-Virgo band with significant eccentricity as suggested by recent studies, though well below an eccentricity of e10Hz less 0.7. Eccentric GW190521-like binaries further motivate the astrophysical science case for a decihertz GW observatory, such as the kilometer-scale version of the Midband Atomic Gravitational-wave Interferometric Sensor (MAGIS). Pre-merger observations of GW190521-like binaries with such a decihertz GW detector would be able to constrain the eccentricity of GW190521-like binaries to greater precision than with just LIGO-Virgo alone. These eccentricity constraints would also provide additional insights into the possible environments that GW190521-like binaries form in.

title: Dynamical tides in neutron stars: The impact of the crust
authors: Andrea Passamonti, Nils Andersson, Pantelis Pnigouras
topic: We consider the dynamical tidal response of a neutron star in an inspiralling binary, focussing on the impact of the star's elastic crust. Within the context of Newtonian gravity, we add the elastic aspects to the theoretical formulation of the problem and quantify the dynamical excitation of different classes of oscillation modes. The results demonstrate the expectation that the fundamental mode dominates the tidal response and show how the usual tidal deformability (and the Love number) emerge in the static limit. In addition, we consider to what extent the different modes may be excited to a level where the breaking strain of the crust would be exceeded (locally). The results show that the fundamental mode may fracture the crust during the late stages of inspiral. This is also the case for the first gravity mode, which reaches the breaking threshold in strongly stratified stars. In our models with a fluid ocean, interface modes associated with the crust-ocean transition may also induce crust fracture. If this happens it does so earlier in the inspiral, at a lower orbital frequency.

title: Probing the nuclear equation of state from the existence of a ~2.6 Msun neutron star: the GW190814 puzzle
authors: A. Kanakis-Pegios, P.S. Koliogiannis, Ch.C. Moustakidis
topic: On August 14, 2019, the LIGO/Virgo collaboration observed a compact object with mass ~2.59+0.08−0.09 Msun, as a component of a system where the main companion was a black hole with mass ~23 Msun. A scientific debate initiated concerning the identification of the low mass component, as it falls into the neutron star - black hole mass gap. The understanding of the nature of GW190814 event will offer rich information concerning open issues, the speed of sound and the possible phase transition into other degrees of freedom. In the present work, we made an effort to probe the nuclear equation of state along with the GW190814 event. Firstly, we examine possible constraints on the nuclear equation of state inferred from the consideration that the low mass companion is a slow or rapidly rotating neutron star. In this case, the role of the upper bounds on the speed of sound is revealed, in connection with the dense nuclear matter properties. Secondly, we systematically study the tidal deformability of a possible high mass candidate existing as an individual star or as a component one in a binary neutron star system. As the tidal deformability and radius are quantities very sensitive on the neutron star equation of state, they are excellent counters on dense matter properties. We conjecture that similar isolated neutron stars or systems may exist in the Universe and their possible future observation will shed light on the maximum neutron star mass problem.

title: The Effect of Jet-Ejecta Interaction on the Viewing Angle Dependence of Kilonova Light Curves
authors: Hannah Klion, Paul C. Duffell, Daniel Kasen, Eliot Quataert
topic: The merger of two neutron stars produces an outflow of radioactive heavy nuclei. Within a second of merger, the central remnant is expected to also launch a relativistic jet, which shock-heats and disrupts a portion of the radioactive ejecta. Within a few hours, emission from the radioactive material gives rise to an ultraviolet, optical, and infrared transient (a kilonova). We use the endstates of a suite of 2D relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of jet-ejecta interaction as initial conditions for multi-dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transport simulations of the resulting viewing angle-dependent light curves and spectra starting at 1.5h after merger. We find that on this timescale, jet shock heating does not affect the kilonova emission. However, the jet disruption to the density structure of the ejecta does change the light curves. The jet carves a channel into the otherwise spheroidal ejecta, revealing the hot, inner regions. As seen from near (less30deg) the jet axis, the kilonova is brighter by a factor of a few and bluer. The strength of this effect depends on the jet parameters, since the light curves of more heavily disrupted ejecta are more strongly affected. The light curves and spectra are also more heavily modified in the ultraviolet than in the optical.

authors: B. Theodore Zhang, Kohta Murase, Chengchao Yuan, Shigeo S. Kimura, Peter Mészáros
topic: The recent detection of TeV photons from two gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), GRB 190114C and GRB 180720B, has opened a new window for multi-messenger and multi-wavelength astrophysics of high-energy transients. We study the origin of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays from the short GRB 160821B, for which the MAGIC Collaboration reported a ~3σ statistical significance. Short GRBs are often accompanied by extended and plateau emission, which is attributed to internal dissipation resulting from activities of a long-lasting central engine, and Murase et al. (2018) recently suggested the external inverse-Compton (EIC) scenario for VHE counterparts of short GRBs and neutron star mergers. Applying this scenario to GRB 160821B, we show that the EIC flux can reach ~10−12 erg cm−2 s−1 within a time period of ~103−104 s, which is consistent with the MAGIC observations. EIC gamma-rays expected during the extended and plateau emission will be detectable with greater significance by future detectors such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The resulting light curve has a distinguishable feature, where the VHE emission is predicted to reach the peak around the end of the seed photons.

title: GRBs from neutrino pair annihilation in the presence of quintessence surrounding a black hole
authors: G. Lambiase, L. Mastrototaro
topic: Quintessence fields, introduced to explain the speed-up of the Universe, might affect the geometry of spacetime surrounding black holes, as compared to the standard Schwarzschild and Kerr geometries. In this framework, we study the neutrino pairs annihilation into electron-positron pairs (nunu- to e-e+) near the surface of a neutron star, focusing, in particular, on the Schwarzschild-like geometry in presence of quintessence fields. The effect of the latter is to increase the minimum photon-sphere radius (Rph), increasing in such a way the maximum energy deposition rate near to Rph. The rate turns out to be several orders of magnitude greater than the rate computed in the framework of General Relativity. These results might provide an efficient mechanism for the generation of GRBs and lead to constraints on the parameters of the quintessence model.

authors: Arianna Ligorini, Jacek Niemiec, Oleh Kobzar, Masanori Iwamoto, Artem Bohdan, Martin Pohl, Yosuke Matsumoto, Takanobu Amano, Shuichi Matsukiyo, Yodai Esaki, Masahiro Hoshino
topic: Mildly relativistic shocks in magnetized electron-ion plasmas are investigated with 2D kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of unprecedentedly high resolution and large scale for conditions that may be found at internal shocks in blazar cores. Ion-scale effects cause corrugations along the shock surface whose properties somewhat depend on the configuration of the mean perpendicular magnetic field, that is either in or out of the simulation plane. We show that the synchrotron maser instability persists to operate in mildly relativistic shocks in agreement with theoretical predictions and produces coherent emission of upstream-propagating electromagnetic waves. Shock front ripples are excited in both mean-field configurations and they engender effective wave amplification. The interaction of these waves with upstream plasma generates electrostatic wakefields.

title: Simulations of radiation driven winds from Keplerian discs
authors: Sananda Raichaidhuri, Mukesh K. Vyas, Indranil Chattopadhyay
topic: We study the ejection of winds from thin accretion discs around stellar mass black holes and the time evolution of these winds in presence of radiation field generated by the accretion disc. Winds are produced by radiation, thermal pressure and the centrifugal force of the disc. The winds are found to be mildly relativistic, with speeds reaching up to terminal speeds 0.1 for accretion rate 4 in Eddington units. We show that the ejected matter gets its rotation by transporting angular momentum from the disc to the wind. We also show that the radiation drag affects the accretion disc winds in a very significant manner. Not only that the terminal speeds are reduced by an order of magnitude due to radiation drag, but we also show that the non-linear effect of radiation drag, can mitigate the formation of the winds from the matter ejected by the accretion disc. As radiation drag reduces the velocity of the wind, the mass outflow rate is reduced in its presence as well.

title: Gravitational-wave asteroseismology with f-modes from neutron star binaries at the merger phase
authors: Harry Ho-Yin Ng, Patrick Chi-Kit Cheong, Lap-Ming Lin, Tjonnie Guang Feng Li
topic: Gravitational-wave signals from coalescing binary neutron stars can yield important information about the properties of nuclear-matter equation of state from the early part of the signal through tidal effects to the properties and oscillation frequencies of the merger product. We investigate a direct link between the properties of isolated neutron stars and their merger, by comparing the frequency of the fundamental oscillation mode (f-mode) of neutron stars with the gravitational-wave frequency associated with the merger of two neutron stars. We calculate the quadrupolar (l=2) f-mode oscillation (f2f) of non-rotating and rotating neutron stars using a nonlinear hydrodynamics code in the conformally-flat approximation and obtain the gravitational-wave frequency associated with the peak amplitude (fmax) of binary-neutron stars from a set of publicly available simulations. We find that fmax and f2f differ by about 1\%, on average, across forty-five equal-mass systems with different total mass and equations of state. Assuming that the gravitational-wave frequency is still approximately equal to twice the orbital frequency Omega near the merger, the result indicates that the condition for tidal resonance |m|Omega=f2f is satisfied to high accuracy near the merger, where m=2 is the azimuthal quantum number. Moreover, the well established universal relation between fmax and the tidal deformability of equal-mass binary systems can now be explained by a similar relation between f2f and the tidal deformability of isolated neutron stars, which has been demonstrated to be associated with the nearly incompressible properties of neutron stars. Our findings suggest that it is possible to relate the gravitational-wave signal at the merger of a binary neutron star system directly to the fundamental oscillation modes and the mass ratio.

title: The evolution of binary neutron star post-merger remnants: a review
authors: Nikhil Sarin, Paul D. Lasky
topic: Two neutron stars merge somewhere in the Universe approximately every 10 seconds, creating violent explosions observable in gravitational waves and across the electromagnetic spectrum. The transformative coincident gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 gave invaluable insights into these cataclysmic collisions, probing bulk nuclear matter at supranuclear densities, the jet structure of gamma-ray bursts, the speed of gravity, and the cosmological evolution of the local Universe, among other things. Despite the wealth of information, it is still unclear when the remnant of GW170817 collapsed to form a black hole. Evidence from other short gamma-ray bursts indicates a large fraction of mergers may form long-lived neutron stars. We review what is known observationally and theoretically about binary neutron star post-merger remnants. From a theoretical perspective, we review our understanding of the evolution of short- and long-lived merger remnants, including fluid, magnetic-field, and temperature evolution. These considerations impact prospects of detection of gravitational waves from either short- or long-lived neutron star remnants which potentially allows for new probes into the hot nuclear equation of state in conditions inaccessible in terrestrial experiments. We also review prospects for determining post-merger physics from current and future electromagnetic observations, including kilonovae and late-time x-ray and radio afterglow observations.

title: External Inverse-Compton Emission from Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts: Application to GRB 190829A
authors: B. Theodore Zhang, Kohta Murase, Péter Veres, Péter Mészáros
topic: The detection of TeV gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) brought new opportunities to study the physics of particle acceleration at relativistic shocks. The H.E.S.S. telescopes recently observed very-high-energy (VHE) emission from a nearby low-luminosity GRB, GRB 190829A. Follow-up observations with, e.g., Swift-XRT, revealed unusual flare activities at ~103 s, which can be caused by a long-lasting central engine. We show that the VHE emission during the H.E.S.S. observation time is naturally produced in the external inverse-Compton (EIC) scenario, where seed photons supplied by the flares or other late-time dissipation are upscattered to VHE energies by the non-thermal electrons accelerated at the external forward shock. Our calculations show that the EIC flare nearly coincides with the late-prompt flare, but extends ~3−4 times longer than the duration of the late-prompt flare. The preferred kinetic energy and initial Lorentz factor used in our model are ~1052 erg and ~20, respectively. Understanding the mechanisms of the VHE emission from low-luminosity GRBs will help us constrain the properties of the outflow and the central engine activities, as well as the particle acceleration mechanism.

title: Off-centred force-free neutron star magnetospheres
authors: Jérôme Pétri
topic: Neutron star electromagnetic activity produces pairs that fill their magnetosphere represented to the zeroth order by the force-free approximation. Neither dissipation nor acceleration nor radiation from charged particles is expected from this simplified model. So far, only centred dipole magnetic fields have been studied in this limit. In this paper, we explore the consequences of a rotating off-centred dipole on the force-free magnetosphere, showing the new magnetic field geometry, its spin-down luminosity as well as the electromagnetic kick and torque felt by the neutron star. Solutions are obtained by time-dependent numerical simulations of the force-free regime using our pseudo-spectral code written in spherical coordinates. Our results are also compared to known analytical expressions found for the off-centred vacuum dipole by an expansion to lowest order in the parameter eps=d/R, where d is the displacement of the dipole from the stellar centre and R the neutron star radius. The presence of a force-free plasma enhances the spin-down luminosity as well as the electromagnetic kick and torque with respect to a centred force-free dipole. The impact on isolated and binary neutron stars is revised in light of these new results.

title: MAGIC observations of the nearby short gamma-ray burst GRB 160821B
authors: MAGIC Collaboration
topic: The coincident detection of GW170817 in gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation spanning the radio to MeV gamma-ray bands provided the first direct evidence that short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can originate from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. On the other hand, the properties of short GRBs in high-energy gamma rays are still poorly constrained, with only ~20 events detected in the GeV band, and none in the TeV band. GRB~160821B is one of the nearest short GRBs known at z=0.162. Recent analyses of the multiwavelength observational data of its afterglow emission revealed an optical-infrared kilonova component, characteristic of heavy-element nucleosynthesis in a BNS merger. Aiming to better clarify the nature of short GRBs, this burst was automatically followed up with the MAGIC telescopes, starting from 24 seconds after the burst trigger. Evidence of a gamma-ray signal is found above ~0.5 TeV at a significance of ~3σ during observations that lasted until 4 hours after the burst. Assuming that the observed excess events correspond to gamma-ray emission from GRB 160821B, in conjunction with data at other wavelengths, we investigate its origin in the framework of GRB afterglow models. The simplest interpretation with one-zone models of synchrotron-self-Compton emission from the external forward shock has difficulty accounting for the putative TeV flux. Alternative scenarios are discussed where the TeV emission can be relatively enhanced. The role of future GeV-TeV observations of short GRBs in advancing our understanding of BNS mergers and related topics is briefly addressed.

title: Determination of Solar System R-Process Abundances using ENDF/B-VIII.0 and TENDL-2015 libraries
authors: Boris Pritychenko
topic: Recent multi-messenger detection of the binary neutron star merger (GW170817) energized the astrophysical community and encouraged further research for determination of nuclear physics observables. Comprehensive studies of atomic nuclei in the cosmos provide an opportunity for investigating these astrophysical phenomena and acquiring complementary information on stellar nucleosynthesis processes that can be verified using the latest nuclear data.
Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF) libraries contain complete collections of reaction cross sections over the energy range relevant to astrophysics, fission yields and decay data. These data collections have been used worldwide in nuclear science, industry and national security applications. There is great interest in exploring the ENDF/B-VIII.0 and TALYS Evaluated Nuclear Data Library (TENDL-2015) for nuclear astrophysics purposes and comparing findings with the Karlsruhe Astrophysical Database of Nucleosynthesis in Stars (KADoNiS).
The Maxwellian-averaged cross sections (MACS) and astrophysical reaction rates have been calculated using the ENDF/B-VIII.0 and TENDL-2015 evaluated data sets. The calculated cross sections were combined with the solar system abundances and fitted using the classical model of stellar nucleosynthesis. Astrophysical rapid- and slow-neutron capture, r- and s-process, respectively, abundances were obtained from present data and compared with available values. Further analysis of MACS reveals potential evaluated libraries data deficiencies and a strong need for new measurements. The current results demonstrate a large nuclear astrophysics potential of evaluated libraries and mutually beneficial relations between nuclear industry and research efforts.

topic: Gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) observations of neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) mergers can provide precise local measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), ideal for resolving the current H0 tension. We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated NSBHs, incorporating both GW and EM selection for the first time. We show that NSBHs could achieve unbiased 1.5-2.4% precision H0 estimates by 2030. The achievable precision is strongly affected by the details of spin precession and tidal disruption, highlighting the need for improved modeling of NSBH mergers.

title: Spectral and polarization properties of black hole accretion disc emission: including absorption effects
authors: Roberto Taverna, Lorenzo Marra, Stefano Bianchi, Mičhal Dovciak, René Goosmann, Frederic Marin, Giorgio Matt, Wenda Zhang
topic: The study of radiation emitted from black hole accretion discs represents a crucial way to understand the main physical properties of these sources, and in particular the black hole spin. Beside spectral analysis, polarimetry is becoming more and more important, motivated by the development of new techniques which will soon allow to perform measurements also in the X- and {\gamma}-rays. Photons emitted from black hole accretion discs in the soft state are indeed expected to be polarized, with an energy dependence which can provide an estimate of the black hole spin. Calculations performed so far, however, considered scattering as the only process to determine the polarization state of the emitted radiation, implicitly assuming that the temperatures involved are such that material in the disc is entirely ionized. In this work we generalize the problem by calculating the ionization structure of a surface layer of the disc with the public code CLOUDY , and then by determining the polarization properties of the emerging radiation using the Monte Carlo code STOKES . This allows us to account for absorption effects alongside scattering ones. We show that including absorption can deeply modify the polarization properties of the emerging radiation with respect to what is obtained in the pure-scattering limit. As a general rule, we find that the polarization degree is larger when absorption is more important, which occurs e.g. for low accretion rates and/or spins when the ionization of the matter in the innermost accretion disc regions is far from complete.

title: Radio timing in a millisecond pulsar-extreme/intermediate mass ratio binary system
authors: Tom Kimpson, Kinwah Wu, Silvia Zane
topic: Radio timing observations of a millisecond pulsar in orbit around the Galactic centre black hole (BH) or a BH at the centre of globular clusters could answer foundational questions in astrophysics and fundamental physics. Pulsar radio astronomy typically employs the post-Keplerian approximation to determine the system parameters. However, in the strong gravitational field around the central BH, higher order relativistic effects may become important. We compare the pulsar timing delays given by the post-Keplerian approximation with those given by a relativistic timing model. We find significant discrepancies between the solutions derived for the Einstein delay and the propagation delay (i.e. Roemer and Sharpiro delay) compared to the fully relativistic solutions. Correcting for these higher order relativistic effects is essential in order to construct accurate radio timing models for pulsar systems at the Galactic centre and the centre of globular clusters and informing issues related to their detection.

title: Kinetic model of large-amplitude oscillations in neutron star pair cascades
authors: Fábio Cruz, Thomas Grismayer, Luis O. Silva
topic: Electron-positron pair cascades developed in the extreme electromagnetic fields of neutron star polar caps are considered a key source of magnetospheric plasma in these objects. We use a simplified model that maps the Quantum Electrodynamics processes governing the pair cascades to analytically and numerically model the development of the pair cascade, and show that large-amplitude oscillations of the electric field are inductively driven by the resulting plasma. A plasma instability arises in these oscillations, and particles accelerated in growing electric field perturbations can drive secondary pair bursts that damp the large-amplitude oscillations. An analytical model is proposed to describe this interplay between the pair production and kinetic collective plasma processes. All analytical results are shown to be in excellent agreement with particle-in-cell simulations.

title: First Multimessenger Observations of a Neutron Star Merger
authors: Raffaella Margutti, Ryan Chornock
topic: We describe the first observations of the same celestial object with gravitational waves and light.
GW170817 was the first detection of a neutron star merger with gravitational waves. The detection of a spatially coincident weak burst of gamma-rays (GRB 170817A) 1.7 s after the merger constituted the first electromagnetic detection of a gravitational wave source and established a connection between at least some cosmic short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and binary neutron star mergers. A fast-evolving optical and near-infrared transient (AT 2017gfo) associated with the event can be interpreted as resulting from the ejection of ~0.05 Msun of material enriched in r-process elements, finally establishing binary neutron star mergers as at least one source of r-process nucleosynthesis. Radio and X-ray observations revealed a long-rising source that peaked ~160 d after the merger. Combined with the apparent superluminal motion of the associated VLBI source, these observations show that the merger produced a relativistic structured jet whose core was oriented =20 deg from the line of sight and with properties similar to SGRBs. The jet structure likely results from the jet interaction with the merger ejecta. The electromagnetic and gravitational wave information can be combined to produce constraints on the expansion rate of the universe and the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. These multimessenger endeavors will be a major emphasis for future work.

title: 1000 days of lowest frequency emission from the low-luminosity GRB 171205A
authors: Barun Maity, Poonam Chandra
topic: We report the lowest frequency measurements of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 171205A with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) covering a frequency range from 250--1450 MHz and a period of days. It is the first GRB afterglow detected at 250--500 MHz frequency range and the second brightest GRB detected with the uGMRT. Even though the GRB is observed for nearly 1000 days, there is no evidence of transition to non-relativistic regime. We also analyse the archival  X-ray data. We also find no evidence of a jet break from the analysis of combined data. We fit synchrotron afterglow emission arising from a relativistic, isotropic, self-similar deceleration as well as from a shock-breakout of wide-angle cocoon. Our data also allow us to discern the nature and the density of the circumburst medium. We find that the density profile deviates from a standard constant density medium and suggests that the GRB exploded in a stratified wind like medium. Our analysis shows that the lowest frequency measurements covering the absorbed part of the light curves are critical to unravel the GRB environment. Our data combined with other published measurements indicate that the radio afterglow has contribution from two components: a weak, possibly slightly off-axis jet and a surrounding wider cocoon, consistent with the results of Izzo et al. (2019). The cocoon emission likely dominates at early epochs, whereas the jet starts to dominate at later epochs, resulting in flatter radio lightcurves.

title: Improved near optimal angular quadratures for polarised radiative transfer in 3D MHD models
authors: Jaume Jaume Bestard, Jiří Štěpán, Javier Trujillo Bueno
topic: Accurate angular quadratures are crucial for the numerical solution of three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer problems, especially when the spectral line polarisation produced by the scattering of anisotropic radiation is included. There are two requirements for obtaining an optimal quadrature and they are difficult to satisfy simultaneously: high accuracy and short computing time. By imposing certain symmetries, we were recently able to derive a set of near optimal angular quadratures. Here, we extend our previous investigation by considering other symmetries. Moreover, we test the performance of our new quadratures by numerically solving a radiative transfer problem of resonance line polarisation in a 3D model of the solar atmosphere resulting from a magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. The new angular quadratures derived here outperform the previous ones in terms of the number of rays needed to achieve any given accuracy.

authors: Yin-Jie Li, Ming-Zhe Han, Shao-Peng Tang, Yuan-Zhu Wang, Yi-Ming Hu, Qiang Yuan, Yi-Zhong Fan, Da-Ming Wei
topic: GW190426 was recently reported as one of the 39 candidate gravitational wave (GW) events in, which has an unusual source-frame chirp mass and may be the first GW signal from a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger. Assuming an astrophysical origin, we reanalyze GW190426 using several waveforms with different characteristics, and consider two different priors for the mass ratio of the binary (Uniform and LogUniform). We find that the results are influenced by the priors of mass ratio, and this candidate could also be from the merger of two low mass black holes (BH). In the case for a binary black hole (BBH) merger, the effective spin is likely negative and the effective precession spin is non-negligible. As for the NSBH merger, supposing the mass of the light object follow the distribution of current neutron stars (NSs) with a reasonably measured/constrained mass, the spin of the low mass BH is so small that is hard to generate bright electromagnetic emission. Finally, we estimate a merger rate of GW190426-like systems to be

title: Maximum mass of hybrid star formed via shock induced phase transition in cold neutron stars
authors: Ritam Mallick, Shailendra Singh, Rana Nandi
topic: This article studies the maximum mass limit of the quark star formed after the shock-induced phase transition of a cold neutron star. By employing hadronic and quark equation of state that satisfies the current mass bound, we use combustion adiabat conditions to find such a limit. The combustion adiabat condition results in a local or a global maximum pressure at an intermediate density range. The maximum pressure corresponds to a local or global maximum mass for the phase transformed hybrid star. The phase transition is usually exothermic if we have a local maximum mass. The criteria for exothermic or endothermic phase transition depend on whether the quark pressure/energy ratios to nuclear pressure/energy are smaller or greater than 1. We find that exothermic phase transition in a cold neutron star usually results in hybrid stars whose mass is smaller than a parent neutron star. The phase transition is endothermic for a global maximum pressure; thereby, one gets a global maximum mass. Hybrid stars much massive than phase transformed local maximum mass can be formed, provided there is some external energy source during the phase transition process. However, for some cases, even massive hybrid stars can form with exothermic phase transition for EoSs having global maximum pressure.

We show that the matching of coefficients of the effective field theory for compact objects from systems that the gravitational wave observatories LIGO-Virgo currently detects might be possible and it can place tight constraints on fundamental physics.

title: Properties of Rotating Neutron Star in Density-dependent Relativistic Mean-field Models
authors: Rashid Riahi, Seyed Zafarollah Kalantari
topic: Equilibrium sequences were developed for rotating NS in the relativistic mean-field interaction framework using four density-dependent equations of state for the NS matter. These sequences were constructed for the observed rotation frequencies of 25, 317, 346, 716, and 1122 Hz. The bounds of sequences were calculated in each model to determine the stability region. The gravitational mass, quadrupole moment, polar, forward and backward redshifts, and Kerr parameter were calculated. DDF and DD-MEdelta were unable to properly describe the low-frequency neutron stars, PSR J0348+432, PSR J1614-2230 , and PSR J0740+6620 rotate at a frequency of 25, 317, and 346 Hz, respectively. All the selected EOSs properly described the rotation of PSR J1748-244ad, and PSR J1739-285 at a frequency of 716 and 1122 Hz, respectively. The mass of these stars was in the range of [0.68, 2.14]Msun and [1.67, 2.24]Msun, respectively. The polar, forward and backward redshifts, and the quadrupole moment were calculated in all selected rotating frequencies and the Keplerian sequence. The results were consistent with observations. Confirming the mass of 1.5+0.4−1.0Msun for EXO 0748-676, our result will be close to the observed value, and the EOSs used in this study properly describe this star. The extremum of Kerr parameter, polar, forward and backward redshifts in all models reached constant values of, a/M= 0.7, Zp= 0.8, Zfeq= -0.3 and Zbeq= 2.2. These behaviors of redshifts and Kerr parameter are approximately independent of EOS. The observed behaviors must evaluate by other EOSs to find universal relations for these quantities. Also, a limit value was found for each of these parameters. In this case where these parameters are greater than the limit value, the star can rotate at a frequency equal to or greater than ν= 1122 Hz.

title: Radiative turbulent flares in magnetically-dominated plasmas
authors: J. Nättilä, A. M. Beloborodov
topic: We perform 2D and 3D kinetic simulations of reconnection-mediated turbulent flares in a magnetized electron-positron plasma, with weak and strong radiative cooling. Such flares can be generated around neutron stars and accreting black holes. We focus on the magnetically-dominated regime where tension of the background magnetic field lines exceeds the plasma rest mass by a factor 1. In the simulations, turbulence is excited on a macroscopic scale l0, and we observe that it develops by forming thin, dynamic current sheets on various scales. The deposited macroscopic energy dissipates by energizing thermal and nonthermal particles. The particle energy distribution is shaped by impulsive acceleration in reconnecting current sheets, gradual stochastic acceleration, and radiative losses. We parameterize radiative cooling by the ratio A of light-crossing time l0/c to a cooling timescale, and study the effect of increasing A on the flare. When radiative losses are sufficiently weak, Aless10-10, the produced emission is dominated by stochastically accelerated particles, and the radiative power depends logarithmically on A. The resulting flare radiation spectrum is broad and anisotropic. In the strong-cooling regime, Agreater 10-10, stochastic acceleration is suppressed while impulsive acceleration in the current sheets continues to operate. As A increases further, the emission becomes dominated by thermal particles. Our simulations offer a new tool to study particle acceleration by turbulence, especially at high energies, where cooling competes with acceleration. We find that the particle distribution is influenced by strong intermittency of dissipation, and stochastic acceleration cannot be described by a universal diffusion coefficient.

title: Years Delayed Gamma-ray and Radio Afterglows Originated from TDE Wind-Torus Interactions
authors: Guobin Mou, Wei Wang
topic: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) that occur in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with dusty tori are a special class of sources. TDEs can generate ultrafast and large opening-angle winds, which will almost inevitably collide with the preexisting AGN dusty tori a few years later after the TDE outburst. The wind-torus interactions will drive two kinds of shocks: the bow shocks at the windward side of the torus clouds, and the cloud shocks inside the torus clouds. In a previous work, we proved that the shocked clouds will give rise to considerable X-ray emissions. In this work, we focus on the radiations of high energy particles accelerated at both shocks. Benefitting from the strong radiation field at the inner edge of the torus, the inverse Compton scattering of AGN photons by relativistic electrons at bow shocks dominates the overall gamma-ray radiation. Our scenario provides a prediction of the years delayed afterglows in radio/X-ray/gamma-ray band for TDE and reveals their connections, Moreover, it suggests a novel method for exploring the clouds around the central black hole and the power of TDE winds.

title: Fast ejecta as a potential way to distinguish black holes from neutron stars in high-mass gravitational-wave events
authors: Elias R. Most, L. Jens Papenfort, Samuel Tootle, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: High-mass gravitational-wave events in the neutron-star mass range, such as GW190425, have recently started to be detected by the LIGO/Virgo detectors. If the masses of the two binary components fall in the neutron-star mass range, such a system is typically classified as a binary neutron-star system, although the detected gravitational-wave signal may be too noisy to clearly establish a neutron-star nature of the high-mass component in the binary and rule out a black hole--neutron star system for such an event. We here show that high-mass binary neutron-star mergers with a very massive neutron-star primary close to the maximum-mass limit, m1 greater 2.2Msun, produce fast dynamical mass ejecta from the spin-up of the primary star at merger. By simulating the merger of black hole--neutron star systems of exactly the same masses and spins, we show that these fast ejecta are entirely absent, if the primary is instead a black hole. In addition, we find that both systems leave almost identical amounts of baryon mass behind, which is not immediately accreted by the black hole. This implies that both systems will likely have comparable electromagnetic afterglow emission stemming from the remnant disk. Hence, fast ejecta at merger have the potentialto distinguish neutron stars from black holes in high-mass mergers, although these ejecta may be challenging to detect observationally.

title: Microscopic equation of state of hot nuclear matter for numerical relativity simulations
authors: Domenico Logoteta, Albino Perego, Ignazio Bombaci
topic: A precise understanding of the equation of state (EOS) of dense and hot matter is key to modeling relativistic astrophysical environments, including core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), protoneutron star (PNSs) evolution, and compact binary mergers. In this paper, we extend the microscopic zero-temperature BL (Bombaci and Logoteta) derived by Bombaci and Logoteta to finite temperature and arbitrary nuclear composition. We employ this new EOS to describe hot beta-stable nuclear matter and to compute various structural properties of nonrotating protoneutron stars. We also apply the EOS to perform dynamical simulations of a spherically symmetric CCSN. The EOS is derived using the finite temperature extension of the Brueckner--Bethe--Goldstone quantum many-body theory in the Brueckner--Hartree--Fock approximation. Neutron star properties are computed by solving the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff structure equations numerically. The sperically symmetric CCSN simulations are performed using the AGILE-IDSA code. Our EOS models are able to reproduce typical features of both PNS and spherically symmetric CCSN simulations. In addition, our EOS model is consistent with present measured neutron star masses and particularly with the masses: ...

title: In situ evidence of ion acceleration between consecutive reconnection jet fronts
authors: Filomena Catapano, Alessandro Retino, Gaetano Zimbardo, et al
topic: Processes driven by unsteady reconnection can efficiently accelerate particles in many astrophysical plasmas. An example are the reconnection jet fronts in an outflow region. We present evidence of suprathermal ion acceleration between two consecutive reconnection jet fronts observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission in the terrestrial magnetotail. An earthward propagating jet is approached by a second faster jet. Between the jets, the thermal ions are mostly perpendicular to magnetic field, are trapped and are gradually accelerated in the parallel direction up to 150 keV. Observations suggest that ions are predominantly accelerated by a Fermi-like mechanism in the contracting magnetic bottle formed between the two jet fronts. The ion acceleration mechanism is presumably efficient in other environments where jet fronts produced by variable rates of reconnection are common and where the interaction of multiple jet fronts can also develop a turbulent environment, e.g. in stellar and solar eruptions.

title: Two populations of LIGO-Virgo black holes
authors: Gert Hütsi, Martti Raidal, Ville Vaskonen, Hardi Veermäe
topic: We analyse the LIGO-Virgo data, including the recently released GWTC-2 dataset, to test a hypothesis that the data contains more than one population of black holes. We perform a maximum likelihood analysis including a population of astrophysical black holes with a truncated power-law mass function whose merger rate follows from star formation rate, and a population of primordial black holes for which we consider log-normal and critical collapse mass functions. We find that primordial black holes alone are strongly disfavoured by the data, while the best fit is obtained for the template combining astrophysical and primordial merger rates. Alternatively, the data may hint towards two different astrophysical black hole populations. We also update the constraints on primordial black hole abundance from LIGO-Virgo observations finding that in the 2-400Msun mass range, they must comprise less than 0.2% of dark matter.

topic: Recent detailed 1D core-collapse simulations have brought new insights on the final fate of massive stars, which are in contrast to commonly used parametric prescriptions. In this work, we explore the implications of these results to the formation of coalescing black-hole (BH) - neutron-star (NS) binaries, such as the candidate event GW190426152155 reported in GWTC-2. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of natal kicks and the NS's radius on the synthesis of such systems and potential electromagnetic counterparts linked to them. Synthetic models based on detailed core-collapse simulations result in an increased merger detection rate of BH-NS systems (~2.3 yr-1), 5 to 10 times larger than the predictions of "standard" parametric prescriptions. This is primarily due to the formation of low-mass BH via direct collapse, and hence no natal kicks, favored by the detailed simulations. The fraction of observed systems that will produce an electromagnetic counterpart, with the detailed supernova engine, ranges from 2-25%, depending on uncertainties in the NS equation of state. Notably, in most merging systems with electromagnetic counterparts, the NS is the first-born compact object, as long as the NS's radius is less 12km. Furthermore, core-collapse models that predict the formation of low-mass BHs with negligible natal kicks increase the detection rate of GW190426152155-like events to ~0.6yr-1; with an associated probability of electromagnetic counterpart less 10% for all supernova engines. However, increasing the production of direct-collapse low-mass BHs also increases the synthesis of binary BHs, over-predicting their measured local merger density rate. In all cases, models based on detailed core-collapse simulation predict a ratio of BH-NSs to binary BHs merger rate density that is at least twice as high as other prescriptions.

title: Elevated r-process enrichment in Gaia Sausage and Sequoia
authors: David S. Aguado et al
topic: The Gaia Sausage and the Sequoia represent the major accretion events that formed the stellar halo of the Milky Way. A detailed chemical study of these main building blocks provides a pristine view of the early steps of the Galaxy's assembly. We present the results of the analysis of the UVES high-resolution spectroscopic observations at the 8.2m VLT of 9 Sausage/Sequoia members selected kinematically using Gaia DR2. We season this set of measurements with archival data from Nissen & Schuster (2011) and GALAH DR3 (2020). Here, we focus on the neutron-capture process by analysing Sr, Y, Ba and Eu behavior. We detect clear enhancement in Eu abundance ([Eu/Fe]~0.6-0.7) indicative of large prevalence of r-process in the stellar n-capture makeup. We are also able to trace the evolution of the heavy element production across a wide range of metallicity. Barium to europium ratio changes from a tight, flat sequence with [Ba/Eu]=-0.7 reflecting dominant core-collapse SNe contribution, to a clear upturn at higher iron abundances, betraying the onset of contamination from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) ejecta. Additionally, we discover two clear sequences in [Fe/H]-[Ba/Fe] plane likely caused by distinct levels of s-process pollution and mixing within the GS progenitor.

title: A first-principle simulation of blast wave emergence at the photosphere of a neutron star merger
authors: Christoffer Lundman, Andrei Beloborodov
topic: We present the first ab initio simulation of a radiation-mediated shock emerging at the photosphere of a relativistic outflow. The simulation is performed using our code radshock that follows fluid dynamics coupled to time-dependent radiative transfer, calculated with the Monte-Carlo method. We use the code to examine the radiative blast wave emerging from neutron star merger GW~170817. It was previously proposed that the merger ejected a dark, relativistically expanding, homologous envelope, and then an explosion inside the envelope produced the observed gamma-ray burst GRB~170817A. Our simulation demonstrates how the shock wave generates radiation as it propagates through the envelope, approaches its photosphere, releases the radiation, and collapses, splitting into two collisionless shocks of a microscopic thickness. We find the light curve and the spectral evolution of the produced gamma-ray burst; both are similar to the observed GRB~170817A.

authors: Marie-Anne Bizouard, Patricio Maturana-Russel, Alejandro Torres-Forné, Martin Obergaulinger, Pablo Cerdá-Durán, Nelson Christensen, José A. Font, Renate Meyer
topic: The eventual detection of gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) will help improve our current understanding of the explosion mechanism of massive stars. The stochastic nature of the late post-bounce gravitational wave signal due to the non-linear dynamics of the matter involved and the large number of degrees of freedom of the phenomenon make the source parameter inference problem very challenging. In this paper we take a step towards that goal and present a parameter estimation approach which is based on the gravitational waves associated with oscillations of proto-neutron stars (PNS). Numerical simulations of CCSN have shown that buoyancy-driven g-modes are responsible for a significant fraction of the gravitational wave signal and their time-frequency evolution is linked to the physical properties of the compact remnant through universal relation. We use a set of 1D CCSN simulations to build a model that relates the evolution of the PNS properties with the frequency of the dominant g-mode, which is extracted from the gravitational-wave data using a new algorithm we have developed for our study. The model is used to infer the time evolution of a combination of the mass and the radius of the PNS. The performance of the method is estimated employing simulations of 2D CCSN waveforms covering a progenitor mass range between 11 and 40 solar masses and different equations of state. Considering signals embedded in Gaussian gravitational wave detector noise, we show that it is possible to infer PNS properties for a galactic source using Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data at design sensitivities.

title: Morphological evolution of supermassive black hole merger hosts and multimessenger signatures
authors: Colin DeGraf, Debora Sijacki, Tiziana Di Matteo, Kelly Holley-Bockelmann, Greg Snyder, Volker Springel
topic: With the expectation that projects like LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays will detect gravitational waves from supermassive black hole mergers in the near future, it is key that we understand what we can expect those detections to be, and maximize what we can learn from them. To address this, we study the mergers of supermassive black holes in the Illustris simulation, looking at both the overall rate of mergers, and the correlation between merging black holes and the galaxies which host them. We find that these mergers take place in typical galaxies along the MBH-Msun relation, and that between LISA and PTA detections we can expect to probe the full range of galaxy masses. As galaxy mergers can trigger increased star formation, we do find that galaxies hosting low-mass black hole mergers tend to show a slight increase in star formation rates compared to a mass-matched sample. However, high-mass merger hosts have typical star formation rates, due to a combination of low gas fractions and powerful AGN feedback. Although minor black hole mergers do not correlate with disturbed morphologies, major mergers (especially between high-mass black holes) tend to show morphological evidence of a recent galaxy merger which survives for ~500 Myr. However, this typical timescale is of the same order of magnitude as the infall/hardening time of the merging black holes, suggesting that electromagnetic followups to gravitational wave signals may not be able to observe this correlation. We further find that incorporating a realistic timescale delay for the black hole mergers could shift the distribution of merger masses toward higher-mass mergers, decreasing the rate of LISA detections while increasing the rate of PTA detections.

title: The dissipation of toroidal magnetic fields and spin-down evolution of young and strongly magnetized pulsars
authors: Zhi-Fu Gao, Hao Shan, Hui Wang
topic: Magnetars are a kind of pulsars powered mainly by superhigh magnetic fields. They are popular sources with many unsolved issues in themselves, but also linked to various high energy phenomena, such as QPOs, giant flares, fast radio bursts and super-luminous supernovae. In this work, we first review our recent works on the dissipation of toroidal magnetic fields in magnetars and rotationally powered pulsars, then review the spin-down evolution of young and strongly magnetized pulsars, especially of magnetars. We present an interesting and important relation between the magnetization parameter, and magnetic field in the magnetar crust. Finally, we introduce our two works in progress: to explain the magnetar "anti-gltich" events in the thermal plastic flow model and to revisit the expression of braking index n, which is independent of the second derivative of spin frequency of a pulsar and give some proposals for our future work.

topic: We present a detailed multi-wavelength analysis of two short Gamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs) detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory: GRB 160624A at z=0.483 and GRB 200522A at z=0.554. These sGRBs demonstrate very different properties in their observed emission and environment. GRB 160624A is associated to a late-type galaxy with an old stellar population (approx 3 Gyr) and moderate on-going star formation (approx 1 Msun yr-1). Hubble and Gemini limits on optical/nIR emission from GRB 160624A are among the most stringent for sGRBs, leading to tight constraints on the allowed kilonova properties. In particular, we rule out any kilonova brighter than AT2017gfo, disfavoring large masses of wind ejecta (less 0.03 Msun).
In contrast, observations of GRB 200522A uncovered a luminous (LF125W=1042 erg s-1 at 2.3~d) and red (r-H=1.3 mag) counterpart. The red color can be explained either by bright kilonova emission powered by the radioactive decay of a large amount of wind ejecta (0.03 Msun less M less 0.1 Msun) or moderate extinction, E(B-V)=0.1-0.2 mag, along the line of sight. The location of this sGRB in the inner regions of a young (=0.1 Gyr) star-forming (-2-4 Msun yr-1) galaxy and the limited sampling of its counterpart do not allow us to rule out dust effects as contributing, at least in part, to the red color.

title: Neutron tunneling: A new mechanism to power explosive phenomena in neutron stars, magnetars, and neutron star mergers
authors: Carlos A. Bertulani, Ronaldo V. Lobato
topic: Neutron tunneling between neutron-rich nuclei in inhomogeneous dense matter encountered in neutron star crusts can release enormous energy on a short-timescale to power explosive phenomena in neutron stars. In this work we clarify aspects of this process that can occur in the outer regions of neutron stars when oscillations or cataclysmic events increase the ambient density. We use a time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism to determine the rate of neutron diffusion and find that large amounts of energy can be released rapidly. The role of nuclear binding, the two-body interaction and pairing, on the neutron diffusion times is investigated. We consider a one-dimensional quantum diffusion model and extend our analysis to study the impact of diffusion in three-dimensions. We find that these novel neutron transfer reactions can generate energy at the amount of

In contrast to the scenario for the merger of two neutron stars of comparable masses considered repeatedly in the literature, the evolution of such a binary at the final stage consists in a rapid mass transfer to the more massive star and an explosive disruption of the low-mass component. We provide the details of the explosion and calculate the abundances of the heavy elements produced in this process for various initial conditions.

title: Constraints on Nuclear Saturation Properties from Terrestrial Experiments and Astrophysical Observations of Neutron Stars
authors: Soonchul Choi, Tsuyoshi Miyatsu, Myung-Ki Cheoun, Koichi Saito
topic: Taking into account the terrestrial experiments and the recent astrophysical observations of neutron stars and gravitational-wave signals, we impose restrictions on the equation of state (EoS) for isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. Using the relativistic mean-field model with SU(3) flavor symmetry, we investigate the impacts of effective nucleon mass, nuclear incompressibility, and slope parameter of nuclear symmetry energy on the nuclear and neutron-star properties. It is found that the astrophysical information of massive neutron stars and tidal deformabilities as well as the nuclear experimental data plays an important role to restrict the EoS for neutron stars. Especially, the softness of the nuclear EoS due to the existence of hyperons in the core gives stringent constraints on those physical quantities. Furthermore, it is possible to put limits on the curvature parameter of nuclear symmetry energy by means of the nuclear and astrophysical calculations.

title: The scattering order problem in Monte Carlo radiative transfer
authors: A. Krieger, S. Wolf
topic: Radiative transfer simulation is an important tool that allows us to generate synthetic images of various astrophysical objects. In the case of complex three-dimensional geometries, a Monte Carlo-based method that simulates photon packages as they move through and interact with their environment is often used. Previous studies have shown, in the regime of high optical depths, that the required number of simulated photon packages strongly rises and estimated fluxes may be severely underestimated. In this paper we identify two problems that arise for Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations that hinder a proper determination of flux: first, a mismatch between the probability and weight of the path of a photon package and second, the necessity of simulating a wide range of high scattering orders. Furthermore, we argue that the peel-off method partly solves these problems, and we additionally propose an extended peel-off method. Our proposed method improves several shortcomings of its basic variant and relies on the utilization of precalculated sphere spectra. We then combine both peel-off methods with the Split method and the Stretch method and numerically evaluate their capabilities as opposed to the pure Split&Stretch method in an infinite plane-parallel slab setup. We find that the peel-off method greatly enhances the performance of these simulations; in particular, at a transverse optical depth of taumax=75 our method achieved a significantly lower error than previous methods while simultaneously saving more 95% computation time. Finally, we discuss the inclusion of polarization and Mie-scattering in the extended peel-off method, and argue that it may be necessary to equip future Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with additional advanced pathfinding techniques.

title: Magnetic outflows from turbulent accretion disks: I. Vertical structure & secular evolution
authors: J. Jacquemin-Ide, G. Lesur, J. Ferreira
topic: Astrophysical disks are likely embedded in an ambient vertical magnetic field. This ambient field is known to drive magneto-rotational turbulence in the disk bulk but is also responsible for the launching of magnetized outflows at the origin of astrophysical jets. The vertical structure and long-term (secular) evolution of such a system lack quantitative predictions. It is nevertheless this secular evolution that is proposed to explain time variability in many accreting systems such as X-ray binaries. We compute and analyze global 3D ideal-MHD simulations of an accretion disk threaded by a large-scale magnetic field. We evaluate the role of the turbulent terms in the equilibrium of the system. We then compute the transport of mass, angular momentum, and magnetic fields in the disk to characterize its secular evolution. We perform a parameter survey to characterize the influence of disk properties on secular transport.
We find that weakly magnetized disks drive jets that carry away a small fraction of the disk angular momentum. The mass-weighted accretion speed remains subsonic although, there is always an upper turbulent atmospheric region where transonic accretion takes place. We show that a strongly magnetized version of the magneto-rotational instability drives this turbulence. The disk structure is drastically different from the conventional hydrostatic picture. The magnetic field is always dragged inwards in the disk, at a velocity that increases with the disk magnetization. Beyond a threshold on the latter, the disk undergoes a profound radial readjustment. It leads to the formation of an inner accretion-ejection region with a supersonic mass-weighted accretion speed and where the magnetic field distribution becomes steady, near equipartition with the thermal pressure. This inner structure shares many properties with the Jet Emitting Disk model described by Ferreira (1997).

title: A numerical approach for radiative cooling in relativistic outflows
authors: Jesús M. Rueda-Becerril
topic: In high energy astrophysics scenarios such as blazars, GRBs or PWNe, it is highly probable that ultra-relativistic particles interact with photons in their environment through scattering. As long as the energy of the particle is greater than the energy of the interacting photon, the (classical) scattering is known to be in the Thomson regime. Otherwise, quantum effects will affect the scattering cross section, and we enter into the so-called Klein-Nishina regime. It is well known that radiative cooling in the Thomson regime is very efficient, leading to soft high-energy spectra. However, observations have shown that, in many cases, the high energy spectrum of some objects is rather hard. This has led to think that maybe particles are not being cooled down efficiently. Asymptotic approximations of the Klein-Nishina regime have been formulated in the last decades in order to account for these corrections in the distribution of particles responsible for the observed spectrum of high energy sources. In this work we presenta a numerical approach of the Klein-Nishina corrections to the radiative cooling. It has been developed to simulate the evolution of a distribution of particles interacting with photons in their surroundings via inverse Compton scattering.

title: Model independent calibrations of gamma ray bursts using machine learning
authors: Orlando Luongo, Marco Muccino
topic: We alleviate the circularity problem, whereby gamma-ray bursts are not perfect distance indicators, by means of a new model-independent technique based on Bézier polynomials. To do so, we use the well consolidate \textit{Amati} and \textit{Combo} correlations. We consider improved calibrated catalogs of mock data from differential Hubble rate points. To get our mock data, we use those machine learning scenarios that well adapt to gamma ray bursts, discussing in detail how we handle small amounts of data from our machine learning techniques. In particular, we explore only three machine learning treatments, i.e. \emph{linear regression}, \emph{neural network} and \emph{random forest}, emphasizing quantitative statistical motivations behind these choices. Our calibration strategy consists in taking Hubble's data, creating the mock compilation using machine learning and calibrating the aforementioned correlations through Bézier polynomials with a standard chi-square analysis first and then by means of a hierarchical Bayesian regression procedure. The corresponding catalogs, built up from the two correlations, have been used to constrain dark energy scenarios. We thus employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical analyses based on the most recent Pantheon supernova data, baryonic acoustic oscillations and our gamma ray burst data. We test the standard ΛCDM model and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. We discuss the recent H0 tension in view of our results. Moreover, we highlight a further severe tension over Ωm and we conclude that a slight evolving dark energy model is possible.

title: Modelling Neutron Star-Black Hole Binaries: Future Pulsar Surveys and Gravitational Wave Detectors
authors: Debatri Chattopadhyay, Simon Stevenson, Jarrod R. Hurley, Matthew Bailes, Floor Broekgaarden
topic: Binaries comprised of a neutron star (NS) and a black hole (BH) have so far eluded observations as pulsars and with gravitational waves (GWs). We model the formation and evolution of these NS+BH binaries including pulsar evolution using the binary population synthesis code COMPAS. We predict the presence of a total of 50-1300 binaries containing a pulsar and a BH (PSR+BHs) in the Galactic field. We find the population observable by the next-generation of radio telescopes, represented by the SKA and MeerKAT, current (LIGO/Virgo) and future (LISA) GW detectors. We conclude that the SKA will observe 1-60 PSR+BHs, with 0-4 binaries containing millisecond pulsars. MeerKAT is expected to observe 0-30 PSR+BH systems. Future radio detections of NS+BHs will constrain uncertain binary evolution processes such as BH natal kicks. We show that systems in which the NS formed first (NSBH) can be distinguished from those where the BH formed first (BHNS) by their pulsar and binary properties. We find 40% of the LIGO/Virgo observed NS+BHs from a Milky-Way like field population will have a chirp mass geq 3.0 Msun. We estimate the spin distributions of NS+BHs with two models for the spins of BHs. The remnants of BHNS mergers will have a spin of ~0.4, whilst NSBH merger remnants can have a spin of ~0.6 or ~0.9 depending on the model for BH spins. We estimate that approximately 25-930 PSR+BHs will be radio alive whilst emitting GWs in the LISA frequency band, raising the possibility of joint observation by the SKA and LISA.

title: Partial Stellar Explosions -- Ejected Mass and Minimal Energy
authors: Itai Linial, Jim Fuller, Re'em Sari
topic: Many massive stars appear to undergo enhanced mass loss during late stages of their evolution. In some cases, the ejected mass likely originates from non-terminal explosive outbursts, rather than continuous winds. Here we study the dependence of the ejecta mass, mej, on the energy budget E of an explosion deep within the star, using both analytical arguments and numerical hydrodynamics simulations. Focusing on polytropic stellar models, we find that for explosion energies smaller than the stellar binding energy, the ejected mass scales as mej = E to m, where e to m=2.4-3.0 depending on the polytropic index. The loss of energy due to shock breakout emission near the stellar edge leads to the existence of a minimal mass-shedding explosion energy, corresponding to a minimal ejecta mass. For a wide range of progenitors, from Wolf-Rayet stars to red supergiants, we find a similar limiting energy of Emin approx 1046-1047erg, almost independent of the stellar radius. The corresponding minimal ejecta mass varies considerably across different progenitors, ranging from ~10-8Msun in compact stars, up to ~10-2Msun in red supergiants. We discuss implications of our results for pre-supernova outbursts driven by wave heating, and complications caused by the non-constant opacity and adiabatic index of realistic stars.

The precise constancy of the latter can restrict scenarios recently suggested where neutron to mirror neutron mixing occurring in neutron stars, transforms them into mixed stars helping explain the narrow mass distribution observed for pulsars in binary systems. The observation of a very old millisecond pulsar with a mass of 2 solar masses is an additional strong constraint on the above transition. We also note that the observed gravitational waves signals from neutron-neutron stars merger constrain the neutron to mirror neutron transitions inside neutron stars.

title: Simulations of neutrino and gamma-ray production from relativistic black-hole microquasar jets
authors: Th. V. Papavasileiou, O. T. Kosmas, J. Sinatkas
topic: Recently, microquasar jets have aroused the interest of many researchers focusing on the astrophysical plasma outflows and various jet ejections. In this work, we concentrate on the investigation of electromagnetic radiation and particle emissions from the jets of stellar black hole binary systems characterized by their hadronic content in their jets. Such emissions are reliably described within the context of the relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics. Our model calculations are based on the Fermi acceleration mechanism through which the primary particles (mainly protons) of the jet are accelerated. As a result, a small portion of thermal protons of the jet acquire relativistic energies, through shock-waves generated into the jet plasma. From the inelastic collisions of fast (non-thermal) protons with the thermal (cold) ones, secondary charged and neutral particles (pions, kaons, muons, eta-particles, etc.) are created as well as electromagnetic radiation from the radio wavelength band, to X-rays and even to very high energy gamma-ray emission. One of our main goals is, through the appropriate solution of the transport equation and taking into account the various mechanisms that cause energy losses to the particles, to study the secondary particle distributions within hadronic astrophysical jets. After testing our method on the Galactic MQs SS 433 and Cyg X-1, as a concrete extragalactic binary system, we examine the LMC X-1 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way Galaxy. It is worth mentioning that, for the companion O star (and its extended nebula structure) of the LMC X-1 system, new observations using spectroscopic data from VLT/UVES have been published few years ago.

title: Simulations of neutrino and gamma-ray production from relativistic black-hole microquasar jets
authors: Th. V. Papavasileiou, O. T. Kosmas, J. Sinatkas
topic: Recently, microquasar jets have aroused the interest of many researchers focusing on the astrophysical plasma outflows and various jet ejections. In this work, we concentrate on the investigation of electromagnetic radiation and particle emissions from the jets of stellar black hole binary systems characterized by their hadronic content in their jets. Such emissions are reliably described within the context of the relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics. Our model calculations are based on the Fermi acceleration mechanism through which the primary particles (mainly protons) of the jet are accelerated. As a result, a small portion of thermal protons of the jet acquire relativistic energies, through shock-waves generated into the jet plasma. From the inelastic collisions of fast (non-thermal) protons with the thermal (cold) ones, secondary charged and neutral particles (pions, kaons, muons, η-particles, etc.) are created as well as electromagnetic radiation from the radio wavelength band, to X-rays and even to very high energy γ-ray emission.

title: R-mode Stability of GW190814's Secondary Component as a Supermassive and Superfast Pulsar
authors: Xia Zhou, Ang Li, Bao-An Li
topic: The nature of GW190814's secondary component m2 of mass (2.50-2.67)Msun in the mass gap between the currently known maximum mass of neutron stars and the minimum mass of black holes is currently under hot debate. Among the many possibilities proposed in the literature, the m2 was suggested as a superfast pulsar while its r-mode stability against the run-away gravitational radiation through the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz mechanism is still unknown. Using those fulfilling all currently known astrophysical and nuclear physics constraints among a sample of 33 unified equation of states (EOSs) constructed previously by Fortin (2016) using the same nuclear interactions from the crust to the core consistently, we compare the minimum frequency required for the m2 to rotationally sustain a mass higher than 2.50Msun with the critical frequency above which the r-mode instability occurs. We use two extreme damping models assuming the crust is either perfectly rigid or elastic. Using the stability of 19 observed low-mass x-ray binaries as an indication that the rigid crust damping of the r-mode dominates within the models studied, we find that the m2 is r-mode stable while rotating with a frequency higher than 870.2 Hz (0.744 times its Kepler frequency of 1169.6 Hz) as long as its temperate is lower than about 3.9x107K, further supporting the proposal that GW190814's secondary component is a supermassive and superfast pulsar.

title: Astromers in the radioactive decay of r-process nuclei
authors: G. Wendell Misch, T. M. Sprouse, M. R. Mumpower
topic: We study the impact of astrophysically relevant nuclear isomers (astromers) in the context of the rapid neutron capture process (r-process) nucleosynthesis. We compute thermally mediated transition rates between long-lived isomers and the corresponding ground states in neutron-rich nuclei. We calculate the temperature-dependent beta-decay feeding factors which represent the fraction of material going to each of the isomer and ground state daughter species from the beta-decay parent species. We simulate nucleosynthesis by including as separate species nuclear excited states with measured terrestrial half-lives greater than 100 microseconds. We find a variety of isomers throughout the chart of nuclides are populated, and we identify those most likely to be influential. We comment on the capacity of isomer production to alter radioactive heating in an r-process environment.

title: Equilibrium sequences of differentially rotating stars with post-merger-like rotational profiles
authors: Panagiotis Iosif, Nikolaos Stergioulas
topic: We present equilibrium sequences of rotating relativistic stars, constructed with a new rotation law that was proposed by Uryu et al. (2017). We choose rotational parameters motivated by simulations of binary neutron star merger remnants, but otherwise adopt a cold, relativistic N=1 polytropic EOS, in order to perform a detailed comparison to published equilibrium sequences that used the Komatsu, Eriguchi and Hachisu (1989) rotation law. We find a small influence of the choice of rotation law on the mass of the equilibrium models and a somewhat larger influence on their radius. The versatility of the new rotation law allows us to construct models that have a similar rotational profile and axis ratio as observed for merger remnants, while at the same time being quasi-spherical. While our models are highly accurate solutions of the fully general relativistic structure equations, we demonstrate that for models relevant to merger remnants the IWM-CFC approximation still maintains an acceptable accuracy.

title: QCD equations of state and speed of sound in neutron stars
authors: Toru Kojo
topic: Neutron stars are cosmic laboratories to study dense matter in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The observable mass-radius relations of neutron stars are determined by QCD equations of state, and can reflect the properties of QCD phase transitions. In the last decade there have been historical discoveries in neutron stars, the discoveries of two-solar mass neutron stars and neutron star merger events, which have imposed tight constraints on equations of state. While a number of equations of state are constructed to satisfy these constraints, a theoretical challenge is how to reconcile those constructions with the microphysics expected from the hadron physics and in-medium calculations. In this short article we briefly go over recent observations and discuss their implications for dense QCD matter, referring to QCD constraints in the low and high density limits, QCD-like theories, and lattice QCD results for baryon-baryon interactions.

authors: Domenico Trotta, Francesco Valentini, David Burgess, Sergio Servidio
topic: The interaction of collisionless shocks with fully developed plasma turbulence is numerically investigated. Hybrid kinetic simulations, where a turbulent jet is slammed against an oblique shock, are employed to address the role of upstream turbulence on plasma transport. A novel technique, using coarse-graining of the Vlasov equation, is proposed, showing that the transport properties strongly depend on upstream turbulence strength, with turbulent structures-modulated patterns. These results might be relevant for the understanding of acceleration and heating processes in space plasmas.

title: Axisymmetric models for neutron star merger remnants with realistic thermal and rotational profiles
authors: Giovanni Camelio, Tim Dietrich, Stephan Rosswog, Brynmor Haskell
topic: Merging neutron stars are expected to produce hot, metastable remnants in rapid differential rotation, which subsequently cool and evolve into rigidly rotating neutron stars or collapse to black holes. Studying this metastable phase and its further evolution is essential for the prediction and interpretation of the electromagnetic, neutrino, and gravitational signals from such a merger. In this work, we model binary neutron star merger remnants and propose new rotation and thermal laws that describe post-merger remnants. Our framework is capable to reproduce quasi-equilibrium configurations for generic equations of state, rotation and temperature profiles, including nonbarotropic ones. We demonstrate that our results are in agreement with numerical relativity simulations concerning bulk remnant properties like the mass, angular momentum, and the formation of a massive accretion disk. Because of the low computational cost for our axisymmetric code compared to full 3+1-dimensional simulations, we can perform an extensive exploration of the binary neutron star remnant parameter space studying several hundred thousand configurations for different equation of states.

title: Gravitational-wave Signals From Three-dimensional Supernova Simulations With Different Neutrino-Transport Methods
authors: Haakon Andresen, Robert Glas, H-Thomas Janka 
topic: We compare gravitational-wave (GW) signals from eight three-dimensional simulations of core-collapse supernovae from Glas et al. (2019), using two different progenitors with zero-age main sequence masses of 9 and 20 solar masses. The collapse of each progenitor was simulated four times, at two different grid resolutions and with two different neutrino transport methods, using the Aenus-Alcar code. The main goal of this study is to assess the validity of recent concerns that the so-called "Ray-by-Ray+" (RbR+) approximation is problematic in core-collapse simulations and can adversely affect theoretical GW predictions. Therefore, signals from simulations using RbR+ are compared to signals from corresponding simulations using a fully multidimensional (FMD) transport scheme. The 9 solar-mass progenitor successfully explodes, whereas the 20 solar-mass model does not. Both the standing accretion shock instability and hot-bubble convection develop in the postshock layer of the non-exploding models. In the exploding models, neutrino-driven convection in the postshock flow is established around 100 ms after core bounce and lasts until the onset of shock revival. We can, therefore, judge the impact of the numerical resolution and neutrino transport under all conditions typically seen in non-rotating core-collapse simulations. We find excellent qualitative agreement in all GW features and mostly very satisfactory quantitative agreement between simulations using the different transport schemes. Overall, resolution-dependent differences in the hydrodynamic behaviour of low-resolution and high-resolution models turn out to have a greater impact on the GW signals than consequences of the different transport methods. Furthermore, increasing the resolution decreases the discrepancies between models with different neutrino transport.

authors: Mouza Almualla, Shreya Anand, Michael W. Coughlin, Tim Dietrich, Nidhal Guessoum, Ana Sagués Carracedo, Tomás Ahumada, Igor Andreoni, Sarah Antier, Eric C. Bellm, Mattia Bulla, Leo P. Singer
topic: The rise of multi-messenger astronomy has brought with it the need to exploit all available data streams and learn more about the astrophysical objects that fall within its breadth. One possible avenue is the search for serendipitous electromagnetic counterparts of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and gravitational-wave signals, known as kilonovae. With surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which observes the sky with a cadence of ~ three days, the existing counterpart locations are likely to be observed; however, due to the significant amount of sky to explore, it is difficult to search for these fast-evolving candidates. It is thus beneficial for the survey cadence to be optimized to find and identify transients of this type such that further photometric and spectroscopic observations can be made. We explore how to improve the cadence of wide field-of-view surveys like ZTF to enable such identifications. We show that with improved observational choices, e.g., the adoption of a ~ nightly cadence and the prioritization of redder photometric bands, detection rates improve by about a factor of two relative to the nominal cadence. These results demonstrate how an optimal use of ZTF increases the likelihood of kilonova discovery independent of gravitational waves or GRBs, thereby allowing for a sensitive search with less interruption of its nominal cadence through Target of Opportunity programs.

title: "Slow" Radio Bursts from Galactic Magnetars?
authors: Bing Zhang
topic: Recently, one fast radio burst, FRB 200428, was detected from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 during one X-ray burst. This suggests that magnetars can make FRBs. On the other hand, the majority of X-ray bursts from SGR J1935+2154 are not associated with FRBs. One possible reason of such rarity of FRB-SGR-burst associations is that the FRB emission is much more narrowly beamed than SGR burst emission. If such an interpretation is true, one would expect to detect radio bursts with viewing angle somewhat outside the narrow emission beam. These "slow" radio bursts (SRBs) would have broader widths and lower flux densities due to the smaller Doppler factor involved. The 2.2-s long, 111 MHz radio burst detected from SGR J1935+2154 by the BSA LPI radio telescope may be such an SRB if the spectral slope is positive. If the FRB beam is narrow, there should be many more SRBs than FRBs from Galactic magnetars. Non-detection of these SRBs would disfavor the assumption that all SGR bursts are associated with narrow-beam FRBs.

title: The evolution of a newborn millisecond magnetar with a propeller-recycling disk
authors: Shao-Ze Li, Yun-Wei Yu, He Gao, Bing Zhang
topic: A rapidly rotating and highly magnetized neutron star (NS) could be formed from the explosive phenomena such as superluminous supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. This newborn NS can substantially influence the emission of these explosive transients through its spin-down. The spin-down evolution of the NS can sometimes be affected by fallback accretion, although it is usually regulated by the magnetic dipole radiation and gravitational wave radiation of the NS. Under appropriate conditions, the accreting material can be firstly ejected and subsequently recycled back, so that the accretion disk can keep in a quasi-steady state for a long time. Here we describe the interaction of the NS with such a propeller-recycling disk and their co-evolution. Our result shows that, the spin-down of the NS can be initially dominated by the propeller, which prevents the disk material from falling onto the NS until hundreds or thousands of seconds later. It is suggested that the abrupt fall of the disk material onto the NS could significantly suppress the magnetic dipole radiation and then convert the NS from a normal magnetar to a low-field magnetar. This evolution behavior of the newborn NS can help to understand the very different influence of the NS on the early GRB afterglows and the late supernova/kilonova emission.

title: Heat release in accreting neutron stars
authors: Mikhail E. Gusakov, Andrey I. Chugunov
topic: Observed thermal emission from accreting neutron stars (NSs) in a quiescent state is believed to be powered by nonequilibrium nuclear reactions that heat the stellar crust (deep crustal heating paradigm). We derive a simple universal formula for the heating efficiency, assuming that an NS has a fully accreted crust. We further show that, within the recently proposed thermodynamically consistent approach to the accreted crust, the heat release can be parametrized by the only one parameter -- the pressure Poi at the outer-inner crust interface (as we argue, this pressure should not necessarily coincide with the neutron-drip pressure). We discuss possible values of Poi for a selection of nuclear models that account for shell effects, and determine the net heat release and its distribution in the crust as a function of Poi. We conclude that the heat release should be reduced by a factor of few in comparison to previous works.

title: Black hole-neutron star coalescence: effects of the neutron star spin on jet launching and dynamical ejecta mass
authors: Milton Ruiz, Vasileios Paschalidis, Antonios Tsokaros, Stuart L. Shapiro
topic: Black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers are thought to be sources of gravitational waves (GWs) with coincident electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. To further probe whether these systems are viable progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) and kilonovae, and how one may use (the lack of) EM counterparts associated with LIGO/Virgo candidate BHNS GW events to sharpen parameter estimation, we study the impact of neutron star spin in BHNS mergers. Using dynamical spacetime magnetohydrodynamic simulations of BHNSs initially on a quasicircular orbit, we survey configurations that differ in the BH spin, and the binary mass ratio. The general trend we find is that increasing the NS prograde spin increases both the rest mass of the accretion disk onto the remnant black hole, and the rest mass of dynamically ejected matter. a magnetically--driven jet is launched only for q=3:1 regardless of the initial NS spin. The lifetime of the jets 1.5s. and their outgoing Poynting luminosity are consistent with typical sGRBs luminosities and expectations from the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. By the time we terminate our simulations, we do not observe either an outflow or a large-scale magnetic field collimation for the other systems we considered.

title: Binary Neutron Star Mergers in AGN Accretion Disks: Cocoon and Ejecta Shock Breakouts
authors: Jin-Ping Zhu, Bing Zhang, Yun-Wei Yu, He Gao
topic: Compact binary coalescences are believed to occur in accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Here we show that a putative jet launched from the merger of a binary neutron star (BNS) or a neutron star--black hole (NSBH) binary occurred at the migration trap in an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk would be choked. The jet energy is deposited within the disk materials to power a hot cocoon. The cocoon is energetic enough to break out from the AGN disk and produce a bright X-ray shock breakout transient peaking at ~0.15d after the merger. The peak luminosity is estimated as ~1046ergs−1, which can be discovered by Einstein Probe from zless0.5. Later on, the non-relativistic ejecta launched from the merger would break out the disk, powering an X-ray/UV flare peaking at ~0.5d after the merger. This second shock breakout signal may be detected by UV transient searches. The cocoon cooling emission and kilonova emission are outshone by the disk emission. Future joint observations of gravitational waves from BNS/NSBH mergers and associated two shock breakout signatures can provide a strong support for the compact binary coalescence formation channel in AGN disks.

title: s-Processing in AGB Stars Revisited. III. Neutron captures from MHD mixing at different metallicities and observational constraints
authors: Maurizio Busso, Diego Vescovi, Sara Palmerini, Sergio Cristallo, Vincenzo Antonuccio Delogu
topic: We present post process neutron capture computations for Asymptotic Giant Branch stars of 1.5 to 3 Msun and metallicities -1.3 to 0.1. The reference stellar models are computed with the FRANEC code, using the Schwarzschild's criterion for convection. Motivations for this choice are outlined. We assume that MHD processes induce the penetration of protons below the convective boundary, when the third dredge up occurs. There, the 13C(alpha,n)16O neutron source can subsequently operate, merging its effects with those of the 22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg reaction, activated at the temperature peaks characterizing AGB stages. This work has three main scopes. i) We provide a grid of abundance yields, as produced through our MHD mixing scheme, uniformly sampled in mass and metallicity. From it, we deduce that the solar s process distribution, as well as the abundances in recent stellar populations, can be accounted for, without the need of the extra primary like contributions suggested in the past. ii) We formulate analytical expressions for the mass of the 13C pockets generated, in order to allow easy verification of our findings. iii) We compare our results with observations of evolved stars and with isotopic ratios in presolar SiC grains, also noticing how some flux tubes should survive turbulent disruption, carrying C rich materials into the winds even when the envelope is O rich. This wind phase is approximated through the G component of AGB s processing. We conclude that MHD induced mixing is adequate to drive slow neutron capture phenomena accounting for observations. Our prescriptions should permit its inclusion into current stellar evolutionary codes.

title: Emission of magnetar bursts and precursors of neutron star mergers
authors: Andrei M. Beloborodov
topic: Magnetar bursts can be emitted by Alfven waves growing in the outer magnetosphere to nonlinear amplitudes, and triggering magnetic reconnection. Similar magnetic flares should occur quasi-periodically in a magnetized neutron star binary nearing merger. In both cases, fast dissipation in the magnetic flare creates optically thick e+e- plasma, whose heat capacity is negligible compared with the generated radiation energy. Magnetic dissipation then involves photon viscosity and acts through Compton drag on the plasma bulk motions in the reconnection region. The effective temperature of the resulting Comptonization process is self-regulated to tens of keV. The generated X-ray emission is calculated using time-dependent radiative transfer simulations, which follow the creation of e+e- pairs and the production, Comptonization, and escape of photons. The simulations show how the dissipation region becomes dressed in an e+e- coat, and how the escaping spectrum is shaped by radiative transfer through the coat. The results are compared with observed magnetar bursts, including the recent activity of SGR~1935+2154 accompanied by a fast radio burst. Predictions are made for X-ray precursors of magnetized neutron star mergers.

title: Igniting weak interactions in neutron-star post-merger accretion disks
authors: Soumi De, Daniel Siegel
topic: The merger of two neutron stars or of a neutron star and a black hole typically results in the formation of a post-merger accretion disk. Outflows from disks may dominate the overall ejecta from mergers and be a major source of r-process nuclei in our universe. We explore the parameter space of such disks, their outflows, and r-process yields by performing three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations with weak interactions and approximate neutrino transport. We discuss the mapping between initial binary parameters and the parameter space of resulting disks, chiefly characterized by their initial accretion rate. We demonstrate the existence of an ignition threshold for weak interactions at around ~10-3Msun-1 for typical parameters by means of analytic calculations within a 1D alpha-viscosity disk model and by explicit GRMHD simulations. Focusing on the qualitative change in disk physics across the ignition threshold, we find a degenerate, self-regulated, neutrino-cooled regime above the threshold and an advection dominated regime below the threshold. Excess heating in the absence of neutrino cooling below the threshold leads to greater 60% of the initial disk mass being ejected in outflows, with typical velocities ~(0.1-0.2)c in the model we simulate, compared to less then 40% at ~(0.1−0.15)c above the threshold. While disks below the threshold show suppressed production of light r-process elements, disks above the threshold can produce the entire range of r-process elements in good agreement with the observed solar system abundances. Disks below the ignition threshold may produce an overabundance of actinides seen in actinide-boost stars. As gravitational-wave detectors start to sample the neutron-star merger parameter space, different disk realizations may be observable via their associated kilonova emission.

The magnetar was observed in a period of intense X-ray bursting activity and enhanced X-ray emission. We report here on the detection of two radio bursts from 1E1547.0-5408, reminiscent of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). One of the radio bursts was anticipated by ~1s (about half a rotation period of the pulsar) by a bright SGR-like X-ray burst, resulting in a []. Radio pulsations were not detected during the observation showing the FRB-like radio bursts, while they were detected in the previous radio observation. We also found that the two radio bursts are neither aligned with the latter radio pulsations nor with the peak of the X-ray pulse profile (phase shift of ~0.2). Comparing the luminosity of these FRB-like bursts and those reported from SGR1935+2154, we find that the wide range in radio efficiency and/or luminosity of magnetar bursts in the Galaxy may bridge the gap between "ordinary" pulsar radio bursts and the extragalactic FRB phenomenon.

title: Model of heat diffusion in the outer crust of bursting neutron stars
authors: D. G. Yakovlev, A. D. Kaminker, A. Y. Potekhin, P. Haensel
topic: We study heat diffusion after an energy release in a deep spherical layer of the outer neutron star crust. We demonstrate that this layer possesses specific heat-accumulating properties, absorbing heat and directing it mostly inside the star. It can absorb up to about [] due to its high heat capacity, until its temperature exceeds []K and triggers a rapid neutrino cooling. A warm layer with []K can serve as a good heat reservoir, which is thermally decoupled from the inner crust and the stellar core for a few months. We present a toy model to explore the heat diffusion within the heat-accumulating layer, and we test this model using numerical simulations. We formulate some generic features of the heat propagation which can be useful, for instance, for the interpretation of superbursts in accreting neutron stars. We present a self-similar analysis of late afterglow after such superbursts, which can be helpful to estimate properties of bursting stars.

title: What determines the structure of short gamma-ray burst jets?
authors: Gerardo Urrutia, Fabio De Colle, Ariadna Murguia-Berthier, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
topic: The discovery of GRB 170817A, the first unambiguous off-axis short gamma-ray burst arising from a neutron star merger, has challenged our understanding of the angular structure of relativistic jets. The late afterglow of GRB 170817A has been described by a structured jet seen slightly off-axis (at an observer angle of 20-30deg). Studies of the jet dynamics and propagation usually assume that the jet is ejected from the central engine with a top-hat structure and its final structure, which determines the observed light curve and spectra, is primarily regulated by the interaction with the nearby environment. However, relativistic jets are expected to be produced with a structure that is more complex than a simple top-hat, as shown by global accretion simulations. In this work, we present results of numerical simulations of short GRBs launched with a wide range of initial structures, durations, luminosities, and ejection time histories. We follow the interaction of the jet with the pre-collapse, merger remnant wind and compute its final structure at distances 10to11~cm from the central engine. We show that the final jet structure, as well as the resulting afterglow emission (at much larger distances), depend strongly on the initial structure of the jet, its luminosity and duration. We find that the initial structure at the jet is preserved for long-lasting sGRBs, while it is strongly modified for jets barely making their way through the wind. This illustrates the importance of combining the results of global simulations with propagation studies in order to better predict the expected afterglow signatures from neutron star mergers. Structured jets provide a reasonable description of the GRB 170817A afterglow emission with an off-axis angle θobs=22.5∘ while top-hat jets do not.

title: The Non Relativistic Interiors of Ultra-Relativistic Explosions: Extension to the Blandford McKee Solutions
authors: Tamar Faran, Re'em Sari
topic: The hydrodynamics of an ultrarelativistic flow, enclosed by a strong shock wave, are described by the well known Blandford-McKee solutions in spherical geometry. These solutions, however, become inaccurate at a distance ~R/2 behind the shock wave, where R is the shock radius, as the flow approaches Newtonian velocities. In this work we find a new self-similar solution which is an extension to the Blandford-McKee solutions, and which describes the interior part of the blast wave, where the flow reaches mildly relativistic to Newtonian velocities. We find that the velocity profile of the internal part of the flow does not depend on the value of the shock Lorentz factor, Gamma, and is accurate from r=0 down to a distance of R/Gamma2 behind the shock. Despite the fact that the shock wave is in causal contact with the entire flow behind it, a singular point appears in the equations. Nevertheless, the solution is not required to pass through the singular point: for ambient density that decreases slowly enough, rho prop to r-k with, a secondary shock wave forms with an inflow at the origin.

The goal of this work is to study the space-time and the effects of quadrupole moments via studying the properties of these equilibrium sequences of magnetized, non-self-gravitating discs in this space-time. We employed different angular momentum distributions and discussed the procedure of building this toroidal disc model based on a combination of approaches previously considered in the literature. We have shown the properties of this relativistic accretion disc model and its dependence on the initial parameters. Besides, this theoretical model can serve as the initial data for numerical simulations.

title: Polarized Radiation Transfer in Neutron Star Surface Layers
authors: Joseph A. Barchas, Kun Hu, Matthew G. Baring
topic: The study of polarized radiation transfer in the highly-magnetized surface locales of neutron stars is of great interest to the understanding of accreting X-ray pulsars, rotation-powered pulsars and magnetars. This paper explores scattering transport in the classical magnetic Thomson domain that is of broad applicability to these neutron star classes. The development of a Monte Carlo simulation for the polarized radiative transfer is detailed: it employs an electric field vector formalism to enable a breadth of utility in relating linear, circular and elliptical polarizations. The simulation can be applied to any neutron star surface locale, and is adaptable to accretion column and magnetospheric problems. Validation of the code for both intensity and Stokes parameter determination is illustrated in a variety of ways. Representative results for emergent polarization signals from surface layers are presented for both polar and equatorial magnetic locales, exhibiting contrasting signatures between the two regions. There is also a strong dependence of these characteristics on the ratio of the frequency of a photon to the cyclotron frequency. Polarization signatures for high opacity domains are presented, highlighting compact analytic approximations for the Stokes parameters and anisotropy relative to the local field direction for an extended range of frequencies. These are very useful in defining injection conditions deep in the simulation slab geometries, expediting the generation of emission signals from highly opaque stellar atmospheres. The results are interpreted throughout using the polarization characteristics of the magnetic Thomson differential cross section.

title: The first five years of gravitational-wave astrophysics
authors: Salvatore Vitale
topic: Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime generated by the acceleration of astrophysical objects. A direct consequence of Einstein's general relativity, they were directly observed for the first time in 2015 by the twin LIGO observatories. Five years later, tens of gravitational waves have been detected, emitted by pairs of merging compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes. These signals yield insights about the formation of compact objects and their progenitor stars; they enable stringent tests of general relativity and reveal the behavior of matter at supranuclear densities. Bright mergers, emitting both gravitational and electromagnetic waves, are unique probes of the formation of short gamma ray bursts and of heavy elements, and can be used to measure the local expansion rate of the universe.

title: Inclusion of the effect of radiation pressure on the accretion phenomena in astrophysics
authors: Hongsu Kim, Uicheol Jang, Yu Yi
topic: In the present work, we would like to elaborate on Shakura Sunyaev Alpha disk model. To be more concrete, inclusion of the effect of the radiation pressure on the accretion phenomena have been carefully studied. To summarize, the present modification of Shakura Sunyaev Alpha disk model of disk accretion can be regarded as a new candidate theory of ADAF. Reduction of accreting matter's angular velocity leads to the suppression of the disk luminosity and the surface temperature which essentially implies the transition of the standard accretion disk model from CDAF to ADAF.

title: Fast magnetic reconnection structures in Poynting-flux dominated jets
authors: Luís H.S Kadowaki, Elisabete M. de Gouveia Dal Pino, Tania E. Medina Torrejon, Yosuke Mizuno, Pankaj Kushwaha
topic: The ubiquitous relativistic jet phenomena associated with black holes play a major role in high and very-high-energy (VHE) astrophysics. In particular, observations have demonstrated that blazars show VHE emission with time-variability from days (in the GeV band) to minutes (in the TeV band), implying very compact emission regions. The real mechanism able to explain the particle acceleration process responsible for this emission is still debated, but magnetic reconnection has been lately discussed as a strong potential candidate and, in some circumstances, as the only possible one. In this work, we present the results of three-dimensional special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the development of reconnection events driven by turbulence induced by current-driven kink instability along a relativistic jet. ... This suggests that turbulent fast magnetic reconnection driven by kink instability can be a possible process behind the high energy emission variability phenomena observed in blazars.

title: Electromagnetic Counterparts of Compact Binary Mergers
authors: Stefano Ascenzi, Gor Oganesyan, Marica Branchesi, Riccardo Ciolfi
topic: The first detection of a binary neutron star merger through gravitational waves and photons marked the dawn of multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves, and it greatly increased our insight in different fields of astrophysics and fundamental physics. However, many open questions on the physical process involved in a compact binary merger still remain and many of these processes concern plasma physics. With the second generation of gravitational wave interferometers approaching their design sensitivity, the new generation under design study, and new X-ray detectors under development, the high energy Universe will become more and more a unique laboratory for our understanding of plasma in extreme conditions. In this review, we discuss the main electromagnetic signals expected to follow the merger of two compact objects highlighting the main physical processes involved and some of the most important open problems in the field.

title: Gravitational Waves from Disks Around Spinning Black Holes: Simulations in Full General Relativity
authors: Erik Wessel, Vasileios Paschalidis, Antonios Tsokaros, Milton Ruiz, Stuart L. Shapiro
topic: We present fully general-relativistic numerical evolutions of self-gravitating tori around spinning black holes with dimensionless spin a/M=0.7 parallel or anti-parallel to the disk angular momentum. The initial disks are unstable to the hydrodynamic Papaloizou-Pringle Instability which causes them to grow persistent orbiting matter clumps. The effect of black hole spin on the growth and saturation of the instability is assessed. We find that the instability behaves similarly to prior simulations with non-spinning black holes, with a shift in frequency due to spin-induced changes in disk orbital period. Copious gravitational waves are generated by these systems, and we analyze their detectability by current and future gravitational wave observatories for large range of masses. We find that systems of 10Msun - relevant for black hole-neutron star mergers - are detectable by Cosmic Explorer out to ~300 Mpc, while DECIGO (LISA) will be able to detect systems of 1000Msun (105Msun) - relevant for disks forming in collapsing supermassive stars - out to cosmological redshift of z~5 (z~1). Computing the accretion rate of these systems we find that these systems may also be promising sources of coincident electromagnetic signals.

title: Evolution of magnetic deformation in neutron star crust
authors: Yasufumi Kojima, Shota Kisaka, Kotaro Fujisawa
topic: In this study, we examine the magnetic field evolution occurring in a neutron star crust. Beyond the elastic limit, the lattice ions are assumed to act as a plastic flow. The Ohmic dissipation, Hall drift, and bulk fluid velocity driven by the Lorentz force are considered in our numerical simulation. A magnetically induced quadrupole deformation is observed in the crust during the evolution. Generally, the ellipticity decreases as the magnetic energy decreases. In a toroidal-field-dominated model, the sign of the ellipticity changes. Namely, the initial prolate shape tends to become oblate. This occurs because the toroidal component decays rapidly on a smaller timescale than the poloidal dipole component. We find that the magnetic dipole component does not change significantly on the Hall timescale of ~1Myr for the considered simple initial models. Thus, a more complex initial model is required to study the fast decay of surface dipoles on the abovementioned timescale.

title: The Physical Mechanisms of Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Bing Zhang
topic: Fast radio bursts are mysterious millisecond-duration transients prevalent in the radio sky. Rapid accumulation of data in recent years has facilitated an understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms of these events. Knowledge gained from the neighboring fields of gamma-ray bursts and radio pulsars also offered insight. Here I review developments in this fast-moving field. Two generic categories of radiation model invoking either magnetospheres of compact objects (neutron stars or black holes) or relativistic shocks launched from such objects have been much debated. The recent detection of a Galactic fast radio burst in association with a soft gamma-ray repeater suggests that magnetar engines can produce at least some, and probably all, fast radio bursts. Other engines that could produce fast radio bursts are not required, but are also not impossible.

title: Relativistic effective action of dynamical gravitomagnetic tides for slowly rotating neutron stars
authors: Pawan Kumar Gupta, Jan Steinhoff, Tanja Hinderer
topic: Gravitomagnetic quasi-normal modes of neutron stars are resonantly excited by tidal effects during a binary inspiral, leading to a potentially measurable effect in the gravitational wave signal. We take an important step towards incorporating these effects in waveform models by developing a relativistic effective action for the gravitomagnetic dynamics that clarifies a number of subtleties. Working in the slow-rotation limit, we first consider the post-Newtonian approximation and explicitly derive the effective action from the equations of motion. We demonstrate that this formulation opens a novel way to compute mode frequencies, yields insights into the relevant matter variables, and elucidates the role of a shift symmetry of the fluid properties under a displacement of the gravitomagnetic mode amplitudes. We then construct a fully relativistic action based on the symmetries and a power counting scheme. This action involves four coupling coefficients that depend on the internal structure of the neutron star and characterize the key matter parameters imprinted in the gravitational waves. We show that, after fixing one of the coefficients by normalization, the other three directly involve the two kinds of gravitomagnetic Love numbers (static and irrotational), and the mode frequencies. We discuss several interesting features and dynamical consequences of this action. Our results provide the foundation for deriving precision predictions of gravitomagnetic effects, and the nuclear physics they encode, for gravitational-wave astronomy.

title: Kilonova Emission From Black Hole-Neutron Star Mergers. II. Luminosity Function and Implications for Target-of-opportunity Observations of Gravitational-wave Triggers and Blind Searches
authors: Jin-Ping Zhu, Shichao Wu, Yuan-Pei Yang, Bing Zhang, He Gao, Yun-Wei Yu, Zhuo Li, Zhoujian Cao, Liang-Duan Liu, Yan Huang, Xing-Han Zhang
topic: We present detailed simulations of kilonova (KN) and GRB afterglow emission originating from BH-NS mergers. We present KN luminosity function and discuss the detectability of KN and GRB afterglow in connection with GW detections, GW-triggered ToO observations, and blind searches in time-domain survey observations. The predicted absolute magnitude of the BH-NS merger KNe at 0.5day after the merger falls in the range of [−10,−15.5]. The simulated luminosity function contains the viewing angle distribution information of the anisotropic KN emission. We simulate the GW detection rates, detectable distances and signal duration, for the future networks of 2nd, 2.5th, and 3rd generation GW detectors. BH-NS mergers produce brighter KNe and afterglows if the primary BH has a high aligned-spin, and the NS is less-massive with a stiff EoS. The detectability of KN emission is sensitive to the BH spin. If primary BHs typically have a low spin, the EM counterpart of BH-NSs are hard to discover. For the 2nd generation GW detector networks, a limiting magnitude of mlimit~23-24mag is required to detect the KNe even if BH high spin is assumed. This could provide a plausible explanation for the lack of KN detection from BH-NS candidates during O3: either there is no EM counterpart, or the current follow-up observations are too shallow. These observations may still have the chance to detect the on-axis jet afterglow associated with a sGRB or an orphan afterglow. In future GW detection eras, more remote GW signals can be detected, but their associated KNe are more difficult to detect. Follow up observations can in any case detect possible associated sGRB afterglows, from which KN signatures may be studied. For time-domain survey observations, a high-cadence search in redder filters is recommended to detect more BH-NS KNe and afterglows.

title: Some properties of doubly-degenerate stars
authors: Shin'ichirou Yoshida, Junya Tanaka
topic: We investigate critical masses of and circular geodesics around doubly-degenerate stars (DDSs) which are composed of cold nuclear matter as well as cold Fermionic dark matter (DM). We here consider asymmetric dark Fermion with self-interaction as a DM candidate. These stars have core-envelope structures and are categorized into baryon-enveloped and DM-enveloped, according to the composition of their envelope. It is seen that the baryon-enveloped and DM-enveloped classes have their own critical masses determined mainly by the dominant component in their envelope. For a typical parameter sets, we see that a balanced mixture of two species may lead to smaller masses than if the either of the species is dominant.
We also show that for a highly DM-enveloped case circular orbits in the vacuum region terminates at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) in vacuum, but circular orbits of smaller radius are possible in the DM-envelope forming a gap between the ISCO and the inner orbits.

authors: C. Ceccobello, M.H.M. Heemskerk, Y. Cavecchi, W.H.T. Vlemmings, D. Tafoya
topic: Outflows, spanning a wide range of dynamical properties and spatial extensions, have now been associated with a variety of accreting astrophysical objects, from supermassive black holes at the core of active galaxies to young stellar objects. The role of such outflows is key to the evolution of the system that generates them, for they extract a fraction of the orbiting material and angular momentum from the region close to the central object and release them in the surroundings. The details of the launching mechanism and their impact on the environment are fundamental to understand the evolution of individual sources and the similarities between different types of outflow-launching systems. We solve semi-analytically the non-relativistic, ideal, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations describing outflows launched from a rotating disk threaded with magnetic fields using our new numerical scheme. We present here a parameter study of a large sample of new solutions. We study the different combinations of forces that lead to a successfully launched jet and discuss their global properties. We show how these solutions can be applied to the outflow of the water fountain W43A for which we have observational constraints on magnetic field, density and velocity of the flow at the location of two symmetrical water maser emitting regions.

title: A backscattering dominated prompt emission model for the prompt phase of Gamma ray bursts
authors: Mukesh K Vyas, Asaf Pe'er, David Eichler
topic: As gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet drills its way through the collapsing star, it traps a baryonic cork ahead of it. Here we explore a prompt emission model for GRBs in which the jet does not cross the cork, but rather photons that are emitted deep in the flow are scattered inside the expanding cork and escape largely from the back end of it as they push it from behind. Due to the relativistic motion of the cork, these photons are easily seen by an observer close to the jet axis peaking at. We show that this model naturally explains several key observational features including: (1) Low energy spectral slope, and high energy power law index with an intermediate thermal spectral region; (2)decay of the prompt emission light curve as ; (3) Delay of soft photons; (4) peak energy - isotropic energy (the so-called Amati) correlation, with, resulting from different viewing angles. At low luminosities, our model predicts an observable turn off in the Amati relation with. (4) An anti-correlation between the spectral FWHM and time as. (5) Temporal evolution, with increase of the high energy spectral slope with time. (6) Distribution of peak energies  in the observed GRB population.

title: i-process nucleosynthesis: observational evidences from CEMP stars
authors: Partha Pratim Goswami, Aruna Goswami
topic: The surface chemical compositions of a large fraction of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars, the so-called CEMP-r/s stars, are known to exhibit enhancement of both s- and r-process elements. For these stars, the heavy element abundances cannot be explained either by s-process or r-process nucleosynthesis alone, as the production sites of s- and r-process elements are very different, and these two processes produce distinct abundance patterns. Thus, the observational evidence of the double enhancement seen in CEMP-r/s stars remains a puzzle as far as the origin of the elements is concerned. In this work, we have critically analysed the observed abundances of heavy elements in a sample of eight CEMP-r/s stars from literature, to trace the origin of the observed double enhancement. Towards this, we have conducted a parametric-model based analysis to delineate the contributions of s- and r-process nucleosynthesis to the observed elemental abundances. We have further examined if the i-process (intermediate process) nucleosynthesis, that occurs at a high neutron-density (n~1015 cm-3 ) produced during proton-ingestion from a H-rich envelope to the intershell region of an AGB star, that is capable of producing both r- and s-process elements in a single stellar site, could explain the observed abundance patterns of the sample stars. Our analysis shows that the observed abundance patterns of the selected sample of CEMP-r/s stars could be fairly well reproduced using the i-process model yields.

title: Effect of hyperons on f-mode oscillations in Neutron Stars
authors: Bikram Keshari Pradhan, Debarati Chatterjee
topic: As the densities in the interior of neutron stars exceed those of terrestrial nuclear experiments, they provide a scope for studying the nature of dense matter under extreme conditions. The composition of the inner core of neutron stars is highly uncertain, and it is speculated that exotic forms of matter such as hyperons may appear there. Gravitational waves emitted by unstable oscillation modes in neutron stars contain information about their interior composition and therefore allow us to probe the interior directly. Recently, a systematic investigation of f-mode oscillations in neutron stars revealed the role of the uncertainty in nuclear saturation parameters, particularly the effective nucleon mass, on its frequency. In this work, we study the influence of the appearance of hyperons on f-mode oscillation frequencies and therefore on the emission of gravitational waves. We also speculate whether a future detection of f-mode frequencies could provide a possibility of probing the presence of hyperons in the neutron star core.

topic: Orbital decay mechanisms argue that double white dwarf mergers are inevitable, but extremely rare. Whilst some mergers result in explosions, the survivors re-ignite helium and burn brightly for tens of thousands or millions of years. Candidate survivors include extreme helium stars, R CrB variables and various classes of helium-rich subluminous star. Nuclear waste on the survivors' surfaces provides evidence of the stars' nuclear history prior to and their nucleosynthesis during the merger. Extensive and deep spectroscopic surveys offer rich prospects for future discoveries.

title: Heavy double neutron stars: birth, mid-life and death
authors: Shanika Galaudage, Christian Adamcewicz, Xing-Jiang Zhu, Eric Thrane
topic: Radio pulsar observations probe the lives of Galactic double neutron-star (DNS) systems while gravitational waves enable us to study extragalactic DNS in their final moments. By combining measurements from radio and gravitational-wave astronomy, we seek to gain a more complete understanding of DNS from formation to merger. We analyse the recent gravitational-wave binary neutron star mergers GW170817 and GW190425 in the context of other DNS known from radio astronomy. By employing a model for the birth and evolution of DNS, we measure the mass distribution of DNS at birth, at mid-life (in the radio), and at death (in gravitational waves). We consider the hypothesis that the high-mass gravitational-wave event GW190425 is part of a subpopulation formed through unstable case BB mass transfer, which quickly merge in ~10−100 Myr. We find mild evidence to support this hypothesis and that GW190425 is not a clear outlier from the radio population as previously claimed. If there are fast-merging binaries, we estimate that they constitute 8-79% of DNS at birth (90% credibility). We estimate the typical delay time between the birth and death of fast-merging binaries to be =5-401 Myr (90% credibility). We discuss the implications for radio and gravitational-wave astronomy.

authors: Shokoufe Faraji, Audrey Trova
topic: In this paper, we constructed the magnetized thick disc model analytically around the static black hole in the presence of an external distribution of matter up to the quadrupole moment. This space-time is a solution of Einstein field equation describing the exterior of a static and axially symmetric object locally. The goal of this work is to study this space-time and the effects of quadrupole moments via studying the properties of the equilibrium sequences of magnetized, non-self-gravitating discs in this space-time. We discussed a procedure to build the thick disc model based on a combination of two approaches previously considered in the literature. We have shown the properties of this model and its dependence on the initial parameters, which can be used as initial data for numerical models in the scope of general relativity.

topic: We investigate the implications of a hypothetical 2.5Msun neutron star in regard to the possibility of a strong phase transition to quark matter. We use equations of state (EoS) of varying stiffness provided by a parameterizable relativistic mean filed model transitioning in a first order phase transition to quark matter with a constant speed of sound. We find a strong connection between the discontinuity in energy density and the maximal mass generated by the EoS. We demonstrate, that high maximal masses cannot be realized for large discontinuities in energy density, which are necessary for visible twin stars, especially for soft EoSs. As a result twin stars and maximal masses of Mmax greater 2.2Msun are mutually exclusive.

topic: The first self-consistent simulations of electron acceleration during magnetic reconnection in a macroscale system are presented. Consistent with solar flare observations the spectra of energetic electrons take the form of power-laws that extend more than two decades in energy. The drive mechanism for these nonthermal electrons is Fermi reflection in growing and merging magnetic flux ropes. A strong guide field is found to suppress the production of nonthermal electrons by weakening the Fermi drive mechanism. For a weak guide field the total energy content of nonthermal electrons dominates that of the hot thermal electrons even though their number density remains small. Our results are benchmarked with the hard x-ray, radio and extreme ultra-violet (EUV) observations of the X8.2-class solar flare on September 10, 2017.

title: Collapsar R-Process Yields Can Reproduce [Eu/Fe] Abundance Scatter in Metal-Poor Stars
authors: Kaley Brauer, Alexander P. Ji, Maria R. Drout, Anna Frebel
topic: It is unclear if neutron star mergers can explain the observed r-process abundances of metal-poor stars. Collapsars, defined here as rotating massive stars whose collapse results in a rapidly accreting disk around a black hole that can launch jets, are a promising alternative. We find that we can produce a self-consistent model in which a population of collapsars with stochastic europium yields synthesizes all of the r-process material in metal-poor ([Fe/H] less -2.5) stars. Our model reproduces the observed scatter and evolution of scatter of [Eu/Fe] abundances. We find that if collapsars are the dominant r-process site for metal-poor stars, r-process synthesis may be linked to supernovae that produce long gamma-ray bursts. Our results also allow for the possibility that core-collapse supernovae beyond those that launch gamma-ray bursts also produce r-process material (e.g., potentially a subset of Type Ic-BL supernovae). Furthermore, we identify collapsar jet properties (isotropic energy, engine luminosity, or engine time) which may trace r-process yield and verify that the amount of r-process yield produced per collapsar in our model (~0.07 Msun) is consistent with other independent estimates. In the future, achieving 0.05 dex precision on distribution scatter or a reliable selection function would further constrain our probe of r-process production. Our model would also hold for another prompt r-process site with a power-law yield, and work is needed to determine if, for example, fast-merging neutron stars can also explain abundance scatter.

title: Non-thermal neutrinos created by shock acceleration in successful and failed core-collapse supernova
authors: Hiroki Nagakura, Kenta Hotokezaka
topic: We present a comprehensive study of neutrino shock acceleration in core-collapse supernova (CCSN). The leading players are heavy leptonic neutrinos, the former and latter potentially gain the energy up to ~100 MeV and ~200 MeV, respectively, through the shock acceleration. Demonstrating the neutrino shock acceleration by Monte Carlo neutrino transport, we make a statement that it commonly occurs in the early post bounce phase (lowere 50 ms after bounce) for all massive stellar collapse experiencing nuclear bounce and would reoccur in the late phase (after 100 ms) for failed CCSNe. This opens up a new possibility to detect high energy neutrinos by terrestrial detectors from Galactic CCSNe; hence, we estimate the event counts for Hyper(Super)-Kamiokande, DUNE, and JUNO. We find that the event count with the energy of greater 80 MeV is a few orders of magnitude higher than that of the thermal neutrinos regardless of the detectors, and muon production may also happen in these detectors with the energy of greater 100 MeV. The neutrino signals provide a precious information on deciphering the inner dynamics of CCSN and placing a constraint on the physics of neutrino oscillation; indeed, the detection of the high energy neutrinos through charged current reaction channels will be a smoking gun evidence of neutrino flavor conversion.

title: Gravitational waves from mountains in newly born millisecond magnetars
authors: Ankan Sur, Brynmor Haskell
topic: In this paper we study the spin-evolution and gravitational-wave luminosity of a newly born millisecond magnetar, formed either after the collapse of a massive star or after the merger of two neutron stars. In both cases we consider the effect of fallback accretion, and consider the evolution of the system due to the different torques acting on the star, namely the spin up torque due to accretion and spin-down torques due to magnetic dipole radiation, neutrino emission, and gravitational wave emission linked to the formation of a `mountain' on the accretion poles. Initially the spin period is mostly affected by the dipole radiation, but at later times accretion spin the star up rapidly. We find that a magnetar formed after the collapse of a massive star can accrete up to 1 Msun , and survive on the order of 50 s before collapsing to a black hole. The gravitational wave strain, for an object located at 1 Mpc, is hc 10^{-23} at kHz frequencies, making this a potential target for next generation ground based detectors. A magnetar formed after a binary neutron star merger, on the other hand, accretes at the most 0.2 Msun, and emits gravitational waves with a lower maximum strain of the order of hc 10^{-24} , but also survives for much longer times, and may possibly be associated with the X-ray plateau observed in the light curve of a number of short gamma-ray burst.

title: Relativistic Alfven Waves Entering Charge Starvation in the Magnetospheres of Neutron Stars
authors: Alexander Y. Chen, Yajie Yuan, Andrei M. Beloborodov, Xinyu Li
topic: Instabilities in a neutron star can generate Alfven waves in its magnetosphere. Propagation along the curved magnetic field lines strongly shears the wave, boosting its electric current jA. We derive an analytic expression for the evolution of the wave vector k and the growth of jA. In the strongly sheared regime, jA may exceed the maximum current j0 that can be supported by the background electron-positron plasma. We investigate these "charge-starved" waves, first using a simplified two-fluid analytic model, then with first-principles kinetic simulations. We find that the Alfven wave continues to propagate successfully even when κ=jA/j0 gg 1. It sustains jA by compressing and advecting the plasma along the magnetic field lines with particle Lorentz factors ~κ1/2. The simulations show how plasma instabilities lead to gradual dissipation of the wave energy, giving a dissipation power Ldiss~1035(κ/100)1/2(Bw/1011G)erg/s, where Bw is the wave amplitude. Our results imply that dissipation due to charge starvation is not sufficient to power observed fast radio bursts (FRBs), in contrast to recent proposals.

title: Eccentricity evolution of compact binaries and applications to gravitational-wave physics
authors: Vitor Cardoso, Caio F. B. Macedo, Rodrigo Vicente
topic: Searches for gravitational waves from compact binaries focus mostly on quasi-circular motion, with the rationale that wave emission circularizes the orbit. Here, we study the generality of this result, when astrophysical environments (e.g., accretion disks) or other fundamental interactions are taken into account. We are motivated by possible electromagnetic counterparts to binary black hole coalescences and orbits, but also by the possible use of eccentricity as a smoking-gun for new physics. We find that: i) backreaction from radiative mechanisms, including scalars, vectors and gravitational waves circularize the orbital motion. ii) by contrast, environmental effects such as accretion and dynamical friction increase the eccentricity of binaries. Thus, it is the competition between radiative mechanisms and environmental effects that dictates the eccentricity evolution. We study this competition within an adiabatic approach, including gravitational radiation and dynamical friction forces. We show that that there is a critical semi-major axis below which gravitational radiation dominates the motion and the eccentricity of the system decreases. However, the eccentricity inherited from the environment-dominated stage can be substantial, and in particular can affect LISA sources. We provide examples for GW190521-like sources.

title: On the Torque Reversals of Accreting Neutron Stars
authors: Unal Ertan
topic: We have extended the analytical model proposed earlier to estimate the inner disk radius of accreting neutron stars in the strong-propeller (SP) phase, and the conditions for the transitions between the strong and weak propeller (WP) phases (Ertan 2017, 2018) to the WP (accretion with spin-down) and the spin-up (SU) phases, and the torque reversals during the WP/SU transitions. The model can account for some basic observed properties of these systems that are not expected in conventional models: (1) accretion on to the star at low X-ray luminosities and the transitions to the SP phase (no accretion) at critical accretion rates much lower than the rate required for the spin-up/spin-down transition, (2) ongoing accretion throughout a large range of accretion rates while the source is spinning down (WP phase), and (3) transitions between the spin-up and spin-down phases with comparable torque magnitudes, without substantial changes in the mass-flow rate. Our results indicate that the magnitudes of the torques on either side of the torque reversal have a ratio similar for different systems independently of their spin periods, magnetic dipole moments and accretion rates during the transitions. Estimated torque reversal properties in our model are in agreement with the observed torque reversals of 4U 1626--67.

Nuclear isobars harboring urca nuclides can be produced in the ashes of Type I X-ray bursts, but the details of their production have not yet been explored. Using the code {\tt MESA}, we investigate urca nuclide production in a one-dimensional model of Type I X-ray bursts using astrophysical conditions thought to resemble the source GS 1826-24. We find that high-mass (A geq 55) urca nuclei are primarily produced late in the X-ray burst, during hydrogen-burning freeze-out that corresponds to the tail of the burst light curve. The ~0.4--0.6~GK temperature relevant for nucleosynthesis of these urca nuclides is much lower than the ~1~GK temperature most relevant for X-ray burst light curve impacts by nuclear reaction rates involving high-mass nuclides. The latter temperature is often assumed for nuclear physics studies. Therefore, our findings alter the excitation energy range of interest in compound nuclei for nuclear physics studies of urca nuclide production. We demonstrate that for some cases this will need to be considered in planning for nuclear physics experiments. Additionally, we show that the lower temperature range for urca nuclide production explains why variations of some nuclear reaction rates in model calculations impacts the burst light curve but not local features of the burst ashes.

title: Nucleosynthesis imprints from different Type Ia Supernova explosion scenarios and implications for galactic chemical evolution
authors: F. Lach, F. K. Roepke, I. R. Seitenzahl, B. Coté , S. Gronow, A. J. Ruiter 
topic: We analyze the nucleosynthesis yields of various Type Ia supernova explosion simulations including pure detonations in sub- Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, double detonations and pure helium detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs with an accreted helium envelope, a violent merger model of two white dwarfs and deflagrations as well as delayed detonations in Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. We focus on the iron peak elements Mn, Zn and Cu. To this end, we also briefly review the different burning regimes and production sites of these elements as well as the results of abundance measurements and several galactic chemical evolution studies. We find that super-solar values of [Mn/Fe] are not restricted to Chandrasekhar mass explosion models. Scenarios including a helium detonation can significantly contribute to the production of Mn, in particular the models proposed for calcium-rich transients. Although Type Ia supernovae are often not accounted for as production sites of Zn and Cu, our models involving helium shell detonations can produce these elements in super-solar ratios relative to Fe. Our results suggest a re-consideration of Type Ia supernova yields in galactic chemical evolution models. A detailed comparison with observations can provide new insight into the progenitor and explosion channels of these events.

title: Analytical Solution of Magnetically Dominated Astrophysical Jets/Winds
authors: Liang Chen, Bing Zhang
topic: We present an analytical solution of a highly magnetized jet/wind flow. The left-hand of the general force-free jet/wind equation (the "pulsar" equation) is separated into a rotating and a non-rotating term. The two equations with either term can be solved analytically and the two solutions match each other very well. Therefore, we obtain a general approximate solution of a magnetically dominated jet/wind, which covers from the non-relativistic to relativistic regimes, with the drift velocity well matching the cold plasma velocity. The acceleration of a jet includes three stages. 1. The jet flow is located within the Alfven critical surface (i.e. the light cylinder), has a non-relativistic speed, and is dominated by toroidal motion. 2. The jet is beyond the Alfven critical surface where the flow is dominated by poloidal motion and becomes relativistic. The total velocity in these two stages follows the same law vGamma=OmegaR. 3. The evolution law is replaced by vGammaΓ = 1/(Theta sqrt(2-nu)), where Theta is the half opening angle of the jet and Theta less nu less 2 is a free parameter determined by the magnetic field configuration. This is because the earlier efficient acceleration finally breaks the causality connection between different parts in the jet, preventing a global solution. The jet has to carry local charges and currents to support an electromagnetic balance. This approximate solution is consistent with known theoretical results and numerical simulations and it is more convenient to directly compare with observations. This theory may be used to constrain the spin of black holes in astrophysical jets.

title: How are gamma-ray burst radio afterglows populated?
authors: K.Zhang, Z.B.Zhang, Y.F.Huang, L.M.Song, S.J.Zheng, X.J.Li
topic: We systematically analyze three GRB samples named as radio-loud, radio-quiet and radio-none afterglows, respectively. It is shown that dichotomy of the radio-loud afterglows is not necessary. Interestingly, we find that the intrinsic durations (Tint), isotropic energies of prompt gamma-rays (Egamma,iso) and redshifts (z) of their host galaxies are log-normally distributed for both the radio-loud and radio-quiet samples except those GRBs without any radio detections. Based on the distinct distributions of Tint, Egamma,iso, the circum-burst medium density (n) and the isotropic equivalent energy of radio afterglows (Lnu,p), we confirm that the GRB radio afterglows are really better to be divided into the dim and the bright types. However, it is noticeable that the distributions of flux densities (Fhost) from host galaxies of both classes of radio afterglows are intrinsically quite similar. Meanwhile, we point out that the radio-none sample is also obviously different from the above two samples with radio afterglows observed, according to the cumulative frequency distributions of the Tint and the Egamma,iso, together with correlations between Tint and z. In addition, a positive correlation between Egamma,iso and Lnu,p is found in the radio-loud samples especially for the supernova-associated GRBs. Besides, we also find this positive correlation in the radio-quiet sample. A negative correlation between Tint and z is confirmed to hold for the radio-quiet sample too. The dividing line between short and long GRBs in the rest frame is at Tint=1 s. Consequently, we propose that the radio-loud, the radio-quiet and the radio-none GRBs could be originated from different progenitors.

title: Afterglow Synchrotron Radiations follow the Lp,iso-Ep,z-Gamma0 relation of Gamma-Ray Bursts? Cases of GRBs 190114C, 130427A, and 180720B
authors: Xiao-Li Huang (NJU), En-Wei Liang (GXU), Ruo-Yu Liu (NJU), Ji-Gui Cheng (GXU), Xiang-Yu Wang (NJU)
topic: Bimodal spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow of GRBs 190114C, 130427A and 180720B confirm that they are originated from the synchrotron emission (Syn) and synchrotron self-Compton Scattering process (SSC) of electrons accelerated in the jets. The radiation mechanism and the physics of the observed spectrum-luminosity/energy relations of GRBs remain as open questions. By extracting the Syn component through fitting their early afterglow SEDs with the Syn+SSC model, we find that their luminosity (Lsyn), peak energy (Ep,syn,z), and the Lorentz factor of the afterglow fireball (Gammat) follow the Lp,iso-Ep,z-Gamma0 relation of prompt gamma-rays, where Lp,iso is the isotropic luminosity, Ep,z is the peak energy of the νfν spectrum in the burst frame, and Γ0 is the initial Lorentz factor of the fireball. To examine whether late afterglows is consistent with this relation, we calculate the synchrotron component at late afterglows. It is found that they also follow the same Lp,iso-Ep,z-Gamma0 relation, albeit they are not consistent with the Lp,iso-Ep,z relation. Our results may imply that the Lp,iso-Ep,z-Gamma0 would be an universal feature of synchrotron radiations of electrons accelerated in GRB jets throughout the prompt and afterglow phases among GRBs. Its origin is not fully understood and possible explanations are briefly discussed.

title: GW190521 may be an intermediate mass ratio inspiral
authors: Alexander H. Nitz, Collin D. Capano
topic: GW190521 is the first confident observation of a binary black hole merger with total mass M greater 100Msun. Given the lack of observational constraints at these masses, we analyze GW190521 considering two different priors for the binary's masses: uniform in mass ratio and source-frame total mass, and uniform in source-frame component masses. For the uniform in mass-ratio prior, we find that the component masses are msrc1=168+15-61Msun and msrc2=16+33-3Msun. The uniform in component-mass prior yields a bimodal posterior distribution. There is a low-mass-ratio mode (q less 4) with msrc1=100+17−18Msun and msrc2=57+17−16Msun and a high-mass-ratio mode (q greter 4) with msrc1=166+16-35Msun and msrc2=16+14-3Msun. Although the two modes have nearly equal posterior probability, the maximum-likelihood parameters are in the high-mass ratio mode, with msrc1=171Msun and msrc2=16Msun, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 16. These results are consistent with the proposed "mass gap" produced by pair-instability in supernova. Our results are inconsistent with those published in Abbott et al. (2020b). We find that a combination of the prior used and the constraints applied may have prevented that analysis from sampling the high-mass-ratio mode. An accretion flare in AGN J124942.3+344929 was observed in possible coincidence with GW190521 by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We report parameters assuming a common origin; however, the spatial agreement of GW190521 and the EM flare alone does not provide convincing evidence for the association

title: Shedding light on the angular momentum evolution of binary neutron star merger remnants: a semi-analytic model
authors: Matteo Lucca, Laura Sagunski, Federico Guercilena, Christian M. Fromm
topic: The main features of the gravitational dynamics of binary neutron star systems are now well established. While the inspiral can be precisely described in the post-Newtonian approximation, fully relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical simulations are required to model the evolution of the merger and post-merger phase. However, the interpretation of the numerical results can often be non-trivial, so that toy models become a very powerful tool. Not only do they simplify the interpretation of the post-merger dynamics, but also allow to gain insights into the physics behind it. In this work, we construct a simple toy model that is capable of reproducing the whole angular momentum evolution of the post-merger remnant, from the merger to the collapse. We validate the model against several fully general-relativistic numerical simulations employing a genetic algorithm, and against additional constraints derived from the spectral properties of the gravitational radiation. As a result, from the remarkably close overlap between the model predictions and the reference simulations within the first milliseconds after the merger, we are able to systematically shed light on the currently open debate regarding the source of the low-frequency peaks of the gravitational wave power spectral density. Additionally, we also present two original relations connecting the angular momentum of the post-merger remnant at merger and collapse to initial properties of the system.

title: Electromagnetic Emission from a Binary Black Hole Merger Remnant in Plasma: Field Alignment and Plasma Temperature
authors: Bernard J. Kelly, Zachariah B. Eteinne, Jacob Golomb, Jeremy D. Schnittman, John G. Baker, Scott C. Noble, Geoffrey Ryan
topic: Comparable-mass black-hole mergers generically result in moderate to highly spinning holes, whose spacetime curvature will significantly affect nearby matter in observable ways. We investigate how the moderate spin of a post-merger Kerr black hole immersed in a plasma with initially uniform density and uniform magnetic field affects potentially observable accretion rates and energy fluxes. Varying the initial specific internal energy of the plasma over two decades, we find very little change in steady-state mass accretion rate or Poynting luminosity, except at the lowest internal energies, where fluxes do not exhibit steady-state behavior during the simulation timescale. Fixing the internal energy and varying the initial fixed magnetic-field amplitude and orientation, we find that the steady-state Poynting luminosity depends strongly on the initial field angle with respect to the black hole spin axis, while the matter accretion rate is more stable until the field angle exceeds $\sim 45\degree$. The proto-jet formed along the black hole spin-axis conforms to a thin, elongated cylinder near the hole, while aligning with the asymptotic magnetic field at large distances.

title: The impact of magnetic fields on momentum transport and saturation of shear-flow instability by stable modes
authors: A. E. Fraser, P. W. Terry, E. G. Zweibel, M. J. Pueschel, J. M. Schroeder
topic: The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability of a shear layer with an initially-uniform magnetic field in the direction of flow is studied in the framework of 2D incompressible magnetohydrodynamics with finite resistivity and viscosity using direct numerical simulations. The shear layer evolves freely, with no external forcing, and thus broadens in time as turbulent stresses transport momentum across it. As with KH-unstable flows in hydrodynamics, the instability here features a conjugate stable mode for every unstable mode in the absence of dissipation. Stable modes are shown to transport momentum up its gradient, shrinking the layer width whenever they exceed unstable modes in amplitude. In simulations with weak magnetic fields, the linear instability is minimally affected by the magnetic field, but enhanced small-scale fluctuations relative to the hydrodynamic case are observed. These enhanced fluctuations coincide with increased energy dissipation and faster layer broadening, with these features more pronounced in simulations with stronger fields. These trends result from the magnetic field reducing the effects of stable modes relative to the transfer of energy to small scales. As field strength increases, stable modes become less excited and thus transport less momentum against its gradient. Furthermore, the energy that would otherwise transfer back to the driving shear due to stable modes is instead allowed to cascade to small scales, where it is lost to dissipation. Approximations of the turbulent state in terms of a reduced set of modes are explored. While the Reynolds stress is well-described using just two modes per wavenumber at large scales, the Maxwell stress is not.

title: Modelling Type Ic Supernovae with TARDIS: Hidden Helium in SN1994I?
authors: Marc Williamson, Wolfgang Kerzendorf, Maryam Modjaz
topic: Supernovae (SNe) with photospheric spectra devoid of Hydrogen and Helium features are generally classified as Type Ic SNe (SNe Ic). However, there is ongoing debate as to whether Helium can be hidden in the ejecta of SNe Ic (that is, Helium is present in the ejecta, but produces no obvious features in the spectra). We present the first application of the fast, 1-D radiative transfer code TARDIS to a SN Ic, and we investigate the question of how much Helium can be hidden in the outer layers of the SN Ic ejecta. We generate TARDIS models for the nearby, well-observed, and extensively modeled SN Ic 1994I, and we perform a code comparison to a different, well-established Monte Carlo based radiation transfer code. The code comparison shows that TARDIS produces consistent synthetic spectra for identical ejecta models of SN1994I. In addition, we perform a systematic experiment of adding outer He shells of varying masses to our SN1994I models. We find that an outer He shell of only 0.05Msun produces strong optical and NIR He spectral features for SN1994I which are not present in observations, thus indicating that the SN1994I ejecta is almost fully He deficient compared to the He masses of typical He-rich SN progenitors. Finally we show that the He I lambda20851 line pseudo equivalent width of our modeled spectra for SN1994I could be used to infer the outer He shell mass which suggests that NIR spectral follow-up of SNe Ic will be critical for addressing the hidden helium question for a statistical sample of SNe Ic.

title: Spherical shocks in a steep density gradient of expanding media
authors: Taya Govreen-Segal, Ehud Nakar, Amir Levinson
topic: We study the propagation of a Newtonian shock in a spherically symmetric, homologously expanding ejecta. We focus on media with a steep power-law density profile of the form rho propto t-3v−a, with a>5, where v is the velocity of the expanding medium and t is time. Such profiles are expected in the leading edge of supernovae ejecta and sub-relativistic outflows from binary neutron star mergers. We find that such shocks always accelerate in the observer frame and lose causal contact with the bulk of the driver gas, owing to the steep density profile. However, the prolonged shock evolution exhibits two distinct pathways: In one, the shock strength diminishes with time until the shock eventually dies out. In the other, the shock strength steadily increases, and the solution approaches the self-similar solution of a shock is a static medium. By mapping the parameter space of shock solutions, we find that the evolutionary pathways are dictated by α and by the initial ratio between the shock velocity and the local upstream velocity. We find that for a less omega c (omega c = 8), the shock always decays, and that for α>ωc the shock may decay or grow stronger depending on the initial value of the velocity ratio. These two branches bifurcate from a self-similar solution derived analytically for a constant velocity ratio. We analyze properties of the solutions that may have an impact on the observational signatures of such systems, and assess the conditions required for decaying shocks to break out from a finite medium.

title: Dispersion and Rotation Measures from the Ejecta of Compact Binary Mergers: Clue to the Progenitors of Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Z. Y. Zhao, G. Q. Zhang, Y. Y. Wang, F. Y. Wang (NJU)
topic: Magnetars are promising central engines of fast radio bursts (FRBs), since the discovery of FRB 200428 from the Galactic SGR 1935+2154. It is widely believed that magnetars could form by core-collapse (CC) explosions and compact binary mergers, such as binary neutron star (BNS), binary white dwarfs (BWD) and neutron star-white dwarf (NSWD) mergers. Therefore, it is particularly important to distinguish the various progenitors of FRBs. The expansion of the merger ejecta produces a time-evolving dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) that can probe the local environments of FRBs. In this paper, we derive the scaling laws for the DM and RM from ejecta with different dynamical structures (the mass and energy distribution) in the uniform ambient medium (merger scenario) and wind environment (CC scenario). We find that the DM and RM will increase in early phase, while DM will continue to grow slowly but RM will decrease in later phase in merger scenario. We also fit the DM and RM evolution of FRB 121102 simultaneously in BNS merger scenario, and find that the source age is ~10 yr when it was first detected in 2012, and the ambient medium density is ~2.3 cm-3. The large offsets of some FRBs are consistent with BNS/NSWD channel. The population synthesis method is used to estimate the rate of compact binary mergers. The rate of BWD mergers is close to the observed FRB rate. Therefore, the progenitors of FRBs may not be unique.

authors: J. Heinzel, M. W. Coughlin, T. Dietrich, M. Bulla, S. Antier, N. Christensen, D. A. Coulter, R. J. Foley, L. Issa, N. Khetan
topic: The detection of AT2017gfo proved that binary neutron star mergers are progenitors of kilonovae. Using a combination of numerical-relativity and radiative-transfer simulations, the community has developed sophisticated models for these transients for a wide portion of the expected parameter space. Using these simulations and surrogate models made from them, it has been possible to perform Bayesian inference of the observed signals to infer properties of the ejected matter. It has been pointed out that combining inclination constraints derived from the kilonova with gravitational-wave measurements increases the accuracy with which binary parameters can be measured and allows a more accurate inference of the Hubble Constant. In order to not introduce biases, constraints on the inclination angle for AT2017gfo should be insensitive to the employed models. In this work, we compare different assumptions about the ejecta and radiative reprocesses used by the community and we investigate their impact on the parameter inference. While most inferred parameters agree, we find disagreement between posteriors for the inclination angle for different geometries that have been used in the literature. According to our study, the inclusion of reprocessing of the photons between different ejecta types improves the modeling fits to AT2017gfo and in some cases affects the inferred constraints. Our study motivates the inclusion of large ~ 1 mag uncertainties in the kilonova models employed for Bayesian analysis to capture yet unknown systematics, especially when inferring inclination angles, although smaller uncertainties seem appropriate to capture model systematics for other parameters. We also use this method to impose soft constraints on the ejecta geometry of the kilonova AT2017gfo.

title: Ambipolar diffusion velocity and magnetic field evolution in the neutron star core
authors: Monika Sinha
topic: The magnetic field associated with neutron stars are generally believed to be threaded inside the star. In presence of magnetic field the plasma present in the interior of the star goes under several processes which lead to magnetic field evolution. It is thought that magnetar activities are mainly due to field decay. The most important process of field decay inside the core of the star is the ambipolar diffusion of the charged particles present in the interior plasma. The decay rate due to ambipolar diffusion is directly connected to the ambipolar velocity of the charged particles under the influence of present magnetic field. The ambipolar velocity of the charged particles depends on the internal dynamics of the particles. We outline a general method to solve the particle dynamics in presence of magnetic field to have a magneto-hydrodynamic equation form ambipolar velocity. The equation is general and applicable to all possible surrounding conditions e.g. temperature,matter states like normal or superfluid etc.

topic: We develop a neutrino transfer code for core-collapse simulations, that directly solves the multidimensional Boltzmann equations in full general relativity. We employ the discrete ordinate method, which discretizes the six dimensional phase space. The code is an extension of our special relativistic code coupled to a Newtonian hydrodynamics code, which is currently employed for core-collapse supernova simulations. In order to demonstrate our code's capability to treat general relativistic effects, we conduct some tests: we first compute the free streaming of neutrinos in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes and compare the results with the geodesic curves; in the Schwarzschild case we deploy not only a 1-dimensional grid in space under spherical symmetry but also a 2-dimensional spatial mesh under axisymmetry in order to assess the capability of the code to compute the spatial advection of neutrinos; secondly, we calculate the neutrino transport in a fixed matter background, which is taken from a core-collapse supernova simulation with our general relativistic but spherically symmetric Boltzmann-hydrodynamics code, to obtain a steady neutrino distribution; the results are compared with those given by the latter code.

title: Properties of neutrino transfer in a deformed remnant of neutron star merger
authors: Kohsuke Sumiyoshi, Sho Fujibayashi, Yuichiro Sekiguchi, Masaru Shibata
topic: We study properties of neutrino transfer in a remnant of neutron star merger, consisting of a massive neutron star and a surrounding torus. We perform numerical simulations of the neutrino transfer by solving the Boltzmann equation with momentum-space angles and energies of neutrinos for snapshots of the merger remnant having elongated shapes. The evaluation of the neutrino distributions in the multi-dimensions enable us to provide the detailed information of angle and energy spectra and neutrino reaction rates. We demonstrate features of asymmetric neutrino fluxes from the deformed remnant and investigate the neutrino emission region by determining the neutrinosphere for each energy. We examine the emission and absorption of neutrinos to identify important ingredients of heating rates through neutrino irradiation. We show that the contributions of μ- and τ-types neutrinos are important for the heating in the region above the massive neutron star. We also examine the angle moments and the Eddington tensor calculated directly by the neutrino distribution functions and compare them with those obtained by a moment closure approach, which is often used in the study of neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics. We show that the components of the Eddington tensor have non-monotonic behaviors and the approximation of the closure relation may become inaccurate for high energy neutrinos, whose fluxes are highly aspherical due to the extended merger remnant.

title: Temporal Properties of Precursors, Main peaks and Extended Emissions of Short GRBs in the Third Swift/BAT GRB Catalog
authors: X. J. Li, Z. B. Zhang, X. L. Zhang, H. Y. Zhen
topic: A comprehensive study is given to short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) in the third Swift/BAT GRB Catalog from December 2004 to July 2019. We examine in details the temporal properties of the three components in the prompt gamma-ray emission phase, including precursors, main peaks and extended emissions (EE). We investigate the similarity of the main peaks between one-component and two-component sGRBs. It is found that there is no substantial difference among their main peaks. Importantly, comparisons are made between in the single-peaked sGRBs and the double-peaked sGRBs. It is found that our results of main peaks in Swift/BAT sGRBs are essentially consistent with those in CGRO/BATSE ones recently found in our paper I. Interestingly, we suspect, besides the newly-found MODE I/II evolution forms of pulses in BATSE sGRBs in paper I, that there would have more evolution modes of pulses across differently adjacent energy channels in view of the Swift/BAT observations. We further inspect the correlation of the main peaks with either the precursors or the EEs. We find that the main peaks tend to last longer than the precursors but shorter than the EEs. In particular, we verify the power-law correlations related with peak fluxes of the three components, strongly suggesting that they are produced from the similar central engine activities. Especially, we compare the temporal properties of GRB 170817A with other sGRBs with EE and find no obvious differences between them.

authors: Jennifer Barnes, Y. L. Zhu, K. A. Lund, T. M. Sprouse, N. Vassh, G. C. McLaughlin, M.R. Mumpower, R. Surman
topic: Merging neutron stars produce "kilonovae"---electromagnetic transients powered by the decay of unstable nuclei synthesized via rapid neutron capture (the r-process) in material that is gravitationally unbound during inspiral and coalescence. Kilonova emission, if accurately interpreted, can be used to characterize the masses and compositions of merger-driven outflows, helping to resolve a long-standing debate about the origins of r-process material in the Universe. We explore how the uncertain properties of nuclei involved in the r-process complicate the inference of outflow properties from kilonova observations. Using r-process simulations, we show how nuclear physics uncertainties impact predictions of radioactive heating and element synthesis. For a set of models that span a large range in both predicted heating and final abundances, we carry out detailed numerical calculations of decay product thermalization and radiation transport in a kilonova ejecta with a fixed mass and density profile. The light curves associated with our models exhibit great diversity in their luminosities, with peak brightness varying by more than an order of magnitude. We also find variability in the shape of the kilonova light curves and their color, which in some cases runs counter to the expectation that increasing levels of lanthanide and/or actinide enrichment will be correlated with longer, dimmer, redder emission.

title: A unified accreting magnetar model for long-duration gamma-ray bursts and some stripped-envelope supernovae
authors: W. L. Lin, X. F. Wang, L. J. Wang, Z. G. Dai
topic: Both the long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and the Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe~I) have been proposed to be primarily powered by central magnetars. A correlation, proposed between the initial spin period (P0) and the surface magnetic field (B) of the magnetars powering the X-ray plateaus in LGRB afterglows, indicates a possibility that the magnetars have reached an equilibrium spin period due to the fallback accretion. For the SLSNe~I and a fraction of engine-powered normal type Ic supernovae (SNe~Ic) and broad-lined subclass (SNe~Ic-BL), the magnetars could also reach an accretion-induced spin equilibrium, but the corresponding B-P0 distribution suggests a different accretion rate range. Considering the effect of fallback accretion, magnetars with relatively weak fields are responsible for the SLSNe~I, while those with stronger magnetic fields could lead to SNe~Ic/Ic-BL. Some SLSNe~I in our sample could arise from compact progenitor stars, while others that require longer-term accretion may originate from the progenitor stars with more extended envelopes or circumstellar medium.

title: On the deceleration of Fanaroff-Riley Class I jets: mass loading of magnetized jets by stellar winds
authors: Andreu Anglés-Castillo, Manel Perucho, José María Martí, Robert A. Laing
topic: In this paper we present steady-state RMHD simulations that include a mass-load term to study the process of jet deceleration. The mass-load mimics the injection of a proton-electron plasma from stellar winds within the host galaxy into initially pair plasma jets. The spatial jet evolution covers ~500pc from jet injection in the grid at 10~pc from the jet nozzle. Our simulations use a relativistic gas equation of state and a pressure profile for the ambient medium. We compare these simulations with previous dynamical simulations of relativistic, non-magnetised jets. Our results show that toroidal magnetic fields can prevent fast jet expansion and the subsequent embedding of further stars via magnetic tension. In this sense, magnetic fields avoid a runaway deceleration process. Furthermore, when the mass-load is large enough to increase the jet density and produce fast, differential jet expansion, the conversion of magnetic energy flux into kinetic energy flux (i.e., magnetic acceleration), helps to delay the deceleration process with respect to non-magnetised jets. We conclude that the typical stellar population in elliptical galaxies cannot explain jet deceleration in classical FRI radio galaxies. However, we observe a significant change in the jet composition, thermodynamical parameters and energy dissipation along its evolution, even for moderate values of the mass-load.

title: Sleeping beasts: strong toroidal magnetic field in quiescent magnetars explains their large pulsed fraction
authors: Andrei P. Igoshev, Rainer Hollerbach, Toby Wood, Konstantinos N. Gourgouliatos
topic: Magnetars are neutron stars (NSs) with extreme magnetic fields of strength 5x1013 - 1015 G. They exhibit transient, highly energetic events, such as short X-ray flashes, bursts and giant flares, all of which are powered by their enormous magnetic energy. Quiescent magnetars have X-ray luminosities between 1029 and 1035 erg/s, and are further classified as either persistent or transient magnetars. Their X-ray emission is modulated with the rotational period of the NS, with a typical relative amplitude (so-called pulsed fraction) between 10-58 per cent, implying that the surface temperature is significantly non-uniform despite the high thermal conductivity of the star's crust. Here, we present the first 3D magneto-thermal MHD simulations of magnetars with strong toroidal magnetic fields. We show that these models, combined with ray propagation in curved space-time, accurately describe the light-curves of most transient magnetars in quiescence and allow us to further constrain their rotational orientation. We find that the presence of a strong toroidal magnetic field explains the observed asymmetry in the surface temperature, and is the main cause of the strong modulation of thermal X-ray emission in quiescence.

title: Are there radio-loud and radio-quiet Gamma-Ray Bursts?
authors: Joshua Alexander Osborne, Fatemeh Bagheri, Amir Shahmoradi
topic: The potential existence of two separate classes of Long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs) with and without radio afterglow emission, corresponding to radio-bright/loud and radio-dark/quiet populations, has been recently argued and favored in the GRB literature. The radio-quiet LGRBs have been found to have, on average, lower total isotropic gamma-ray emissions (Eiso) and shorter intrinsic prompt gamma-ray duration (e.g., T90z). In addition, a redshift-T90z anti-correlation has been discovered among the radio-loud LGRBs, which is reportedly missing in the radio-quiet class.
Here we discuss the significance of the differences between the energetics and temporal properties of the two proposed classes of radio-loud and radio-quiet LGRBs. We show that much of the proposed evidence in support of the two distinct radio populations of LGRBs can be explained away in terms of selection effects and sample incompleteness. Our arguments are based on the recent discovery of the relatively-strong highly-significant positive correlation between the total isotropic emission (Eiso) and the intrinsic prompt duration (T90z) that is present in both populations of short-hard and long-soft GRBs, predicted, quantified, and reported for the first time by Shahmoradi (2013) and Shahmoradi and Nemiroff (2015).

authors: Lorenzo Nativi (1), Mattia Bulla (2), Stephan Rosswog (1), Christoffer Lundman (1), Grzegorz Kowal (3), Davide Gizzi (1), Gavin Paul Lamb (4), Albino Perego 
topic: Neutron star mergers eject neutron-rich matter in which heavy elements are synthesised. The decay of these freshly synthesised elements powers electromagnetic transients ("macronovae" or "kilonovae") whose luminosity and colour strongly depend on their nuclear composition. If the ejecta are very neutron-rich (electron fraction Ye less 0.25), they contain fair amounts of lanthanides and actinides which have large opacities and therefore efficiently trap the radiation inside the ejecta so that the emission peaks in the red part of the spectrum. Even small amounts of this high-opacity material can obscure emission from lower lying material and therefore act as a "lanthanide curtain". Here, we investigate how a relativistic jet that punches through the ejecta can potentially push away a significant fraction of the high opacity material before the macronova begins to shine. We use the results of detailed neutrino-driven wind studies as initial conditions and explore with 3D special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations how jets are propagating through these winds. Subsequently, we perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations to explore the resulting macronova emission. We find that the hole punched by the jet makes the macronova brighter and bluer for on-axis observers during the first few days of emission, and that more powerful jets have larger impacts on the macronova.

title: Physical, numerical, and computational challenges of modeling neutrino transport in core-collapse supernovae
authors: Anthony Mezzacappa, Eirik Endeve, O.E. Bronson Messer, Stephen W. Bruenn
topic: The proposal that core collapse supernovae are neutrino driven is still the subject of active investigation more than fifty years after the seminal paper by Colgate and White. The modern version of this paradigm, which we owe to Wilson, proposes that the supernova shock wave is powered by neutrino heating, mediated by the absorption of electron-flavor neutrinos and antineutrinos emanating from the proto-neutron star surface, or neutrinosphere. Neutrino weak interactions with the stellar core fluid, the theory of which is still evolving, are flavor and energy dependent. The associated neutrino mean free paths extend over many orders of magnitude and are never always small relative to the stellar core radius. Thus, neutrinos are never always fluid like. Instead, a kinetic description of them in terms of distribution functions that determine the number density of neutrinos in the six-dimensional phase space of position, direction, and energy, for both neutrinos and antineutrinos of each flavor, or in terms of angular moments of these neutrino distributions that instead provide neutrino number densities in the four-dimensional phase-space subspace of position and energy, is needed. In turn, the computational challenge is twofold: (i) to map the kinetic equations governing the evolution of these distributions or moments onto discrete representations that are stable, accurate, and, perhaps most important, respect physical laws such as conservation of lepton number and energy and the Fermi--Dirac nature of neutrinos and (ii) to develop efficient, supercomputer-architecture-aware solution methods for the resultant nonlinear algebraic equations. In this review, we present the current state of the art in attempts to meet this challenge

title: Shock-powered radio precursors of neutron star mergers from accelerating relativistic binary winds
authors: Navin Sridhar (1), Jonathan Zrake (1 and 2), Brian D. Metzger (1 and 3), Lorenzo Sironi (1), Dimitrios Giannios
topic: During the final stages of a compact object merger, if at least one of the binary components is a magnetized neutron star (NS), then the orbital motion of the conducting companion induces a strong current along the magnetic field lines connecting the stars. This interaction also substantially expands the NS's open magnetic flux---and hence increases its wind luminosity---relative to that of an isolated pulsar. As the binary orbit shrinks due to gravitational radiation, the power and speed of this binary-induced inspiral wind may (depending on pair loading) secularly increase, leading to self-interaction and internal shocks in the outflow beyond the binary orbit. The magnetized forward shock can generate coherent radio emission via the synchrotron maser process, resulting in an observable radio precursor to binary NS merger. We perform 1D relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of shock interaction in the accelerating binary NS wind, assuming that the inspiral wind efficiently converts its Poynting flux into bulk kinetic energy prior to the shock radius. This is combined with the shock maser spectrum from particle-in-cell simulations, to generate synthetic radio light curves. The precursor burst with a fluence of ~1 Jy ms at ~GHz frequencies lasts ~1-500 ms following the merger for a source at ~3 Gpc (Bd/1012 G)8/9, where Bd is the dipole field strength of the more strongly-magnetized star. Given an outflow geometry concentrated along the binary equatorial, the signal may be preferentially observable for high-inclination systems, i.e. those least likely to produce a detectable gamma-ray burst.

topic: With the computational power and algorithmic improvements available today, the ongoing STAR/RHIC and HADES/GSI experiments, the future FAIR and NICA facilities becoming operational, and the new precise measurements from NICER and LIGO/VIRGO, the high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics communities are in the unique position to set very stringent constraints on the equation of state of strongly interacting matter. We review the state-of-the-art of different approaches used in the description of hot and ultradense baryonic matter in and out of equilibrium, and discuss the regions in the phase diagram where heavy-ion collisions and neutron star mergers can overlap. Future perspectives are discussed to help define a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary strategy to map out the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter from heavy ion collisions to neutron stars.

title: Probing Fundamental Physics with Gravitational Waves: The Next Generation
authors: Scott E. Perkins, Nicolás Yunes, Emanuele Berti
topic: Gravitational wave observations of compact binary mergers are already providing stringent tests of general relativity and constraints on modified gravity. Ground-based interferometric detectors will soon reach design sensitivity and they will be followed by third-generation upgrades, possibly operating in conjunction with space-based detectors. How will these improvements affect our ability to investigate fundamental physics with gravitational waves? The answer depends on the timeline for the sensitivity upgrades of the instruments, but also on astrophysical compact binary population uncertainties, which determine the number and signal-to-noise ratio of the observed sources. We consider several scenarios for the proposed timeline of detector upgrades and various astrophysical population models. Using a stacked Fisher matrix analysis of binary black hole merger observations, we thoroughly investigate future theory-agnostic bounds on modifications of general relativity, as well as bounds on specific theories. For theory-agnostic bounds, we find that ground-based observations of stellar-mass black holes and LISA observations of massive black holes can each lead to improvements of 2-4 orders of magnitude with respect to present gravitational wave constraints, while multiband observations can yield improvements of 1-6 orders of magnitude. We also clarify how the relation between theory-agnostic and theory-specific bounds depends on the source properties.

title: Kilonova rates from spherical and axisymmetrical models
authors: József Kóbori, Zsolt Bagoly, Lajos G. Balázs
topic: Detecting the thermal emission from double neutron star merger events is a challenging task because of the quick fading of the observed flux. In order to create an efficient observing strategy for their observing method it is crucial to know their intrinsic rate. Unfortunately, the numerous models existing today predict this rate on a vary wide range. Hence, our goal in this paper is to investigate the effect of different level of approximations on the relative rate predictions. Also, we study the effect of distinct ejecta mass lay-outs on the light curve. We find that the ratio of the expected kilonova detections of the spherical to axisymmetrical models is 6:1 (or 2:1, depending on the input parameter set applied in our work). Nevertheless, the light curve shape is only slightly affected by the various ejecta alignments. This means that different ejecta layouts can produce light curves with similar shapes making it a challenging task to infer the structure of the matter outflow. Thus, we conclude that the uncertainty in the rate predictions arising from the various ejecta mass distribution models is negligible compared to the errors present in other input parameters (e.g. binary neutron star merger rate). In addition, we show that up to moderate redshifts (z less 0.2) the redshift distribution type (observed or uniform in volume) does not affect the expected relative rate estimations.

title: Self-modulation of Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Emanuele Sobacchi, Yuri Lyubarsky, Andrei M. Beloborodov, Lorenzo Sironi
topic: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extreme astrophysical phenomena entering the realm of non-linear optics, a field developed in laser physics. A classical non-linear effect is self-modulation. We examine the propagation of FRBs through the circumburst environment using the idealised setup of a monochromatic linearly-polarised GHz wave propagating through a uniform plasma slab of density N at distance R from the source. We find that self-modulation occurs if the slab is located within a critical radius Rcrit~1017(N/102cm-3)(L/1042ergs-1)cm, where L is the isotropic equivalent of the FRB luminosity. Self-modulation breaks the burst into pancakes transverse to the radial direction. When R less Rcrit, the transverse size of the pancakes is smaller than the Fresnel scale. The pancakes are strongly diffracted as the burst exits the slab, and interference between the pancakes produces a frequency modulation of the observed intensity with a sub-GHz bandwidth. When R~Rcrit, the transverse size of the pancakes becomes comparable with the Fresnel scale, and the effect of diffraction is weaker. The observed intensity is modulated on a timescale of ten microseconds, which corresponds to the radial width of the pancakes. Our results suggest that self-modulation may cause the temporal and frequency structure observed in FRBs.

title: Magnetic field evolution timescales in superconducting neutron stars
authors: Mikhail E. Gusakov, Elena M. Kantor, Dmitry D. Ofengeim
topic: The self-consistent approach to the magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores, developed recently, is generalised to the case of superfluid and superconducting neutron stars. Applying this approach to the cold matter of neutron star cores composed of neutrons, protons, electrons, and muons we find that, similarly to the case of normal matter, an arbitrary configuration of the magnetic field may result in generation of macroscopic particle velocities, strongly exceeding their diffusive (relative) velocities. This effect substantially accelerates evolution of the magnetic field in the stellar core. An hierarchy of timescales of such evolution at different stages of neutron star life is proposed and discussed. It is argued that the magnetic field in the core cannot be considered as frozen or vanishing and that its temporal evolution should affect the observational properties of neutron stars.

title: FRB 181112 as a Rapidly-Rotating Massive Neutron Star just after a Binary Neutron Star Merger?: Implications for Future Constraints on Neutron Star Equations of State
authors: Shotaro Yamasaki (HUJI), Tomonori Totani (U. Tokyo), Kenta Kiuchi (AEI)
topic: The light curve of the fast radio burst (FRB) 181112 is resolved into four successive pulses, and the time interval (~0.8 ms) between the first and third pulses coincides with that between the second and fourth pulses, which can be interpreted as a neutron star (NS) spinning at a period of about 0.8 ms. Although this period is shorter than the most rapidly rotating pulsar currently known (1.4 ms), it is typical for a simulated massive NS formed immediately after the coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNS). Therefore, a BNS merger is a good candidate for the origin of this FRB if the periodicity is real. We discuss the future implications that can be obtained if such a periodicity is detected from FRBs simultaneously with gravitational waves (GW). The remnant spin period Prem inferred from the FRB observation is unique information which is not readily obtained by current GW observations at the post-merger phase. If combined with the mass of the merger remnant Mrem inferred from GW data, it would set a new constraint on the equation of state of nuclear matter. Furthermore, the post-merger quantity Prem/Mrem, or the tidal deformability of the merger remnant, is closely related to the binary tidal deformability parameter Lambda of NSs before they merge, and a joint FRB-GW observation will establish a new limit on Lambda. Thus, if Lambda is also well measured by GW data, a comparison between these two will provide further insights into the nature of nuclear matter and BNS mergers.

title: The maximum energy of shock-accelerated electrons in a microturbulent magnetic field
authors: Donald C. Warren, Catherine A. A. Beauchemin, Maxim V. Barkov, Shigehiro Nagataki
topic: Relativistic shocks propagating into a medium with low magnetization are generated and sustained by small-scale but very strong magnetic field turbulence. This so-called "microturbulence" modifies the typical shock acceleration process, and in particular that of electrons. In this work we perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of electrons encountering shocks with microturbulent fields. The simulations cover a three-dimensional parameter space in shock speed, acceleration efficiency, and peak magnetic field strength. From these, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was employed to estimate the maximum electron momentum from the MC-simulated electron spectra. Having estimated this quantity at many points well-distributed over an astrophysically relevant parameter space, an MCMC method was again used to estimate the parameters of an empirical formula that computes the maximum momentum of a Fermi-accelerated electron population anywhere in this parameter space. The maximum energy is well-approximated as a broken power-law in shock speed, with the break occurring when the shock decelerates to the point where electrons can begin to escape upstream from the shock.

title: Formation of spiral structure from the violent relaxation of self-gravitating disks
authors: Tirawut Worrakitpoonpon 
topic: We present the numerical study of the formation of spiral structure in the context of violent relaxation. Initial conditions are the out-of-equilibrium disks of self-gravitating particles in rigid rotation. By that mechanism, robust and non-stationary spiral arms can be formed within a few free-fall times by the shearing of the mass ejection following the collapse. With a closer look, we find different properties of the arms in connection with the initial configuration. The winding degree tends to increase with initial angular speed provided that a disk is thin. If disk surface is circular, both number and position of arms are governed by the Poissonian density fluctuations that produce more arms as more particles are introduced. On the contrary, if the surface ellipticity is imposed, the number of arms and their placement are effectively controlled. Otherwise, the increase of thickness leads to a complicated outcome since the number of arms and winding degree are less effectively controlled. We speculate that this complexity is caused by a strong non-axisymmetric field during the violent relaxation that disorganizes the pre-collapse motion and the concentration of particles.

topic: The giant flares of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) have long been proposed to contribute to at least a subsample of the observed short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the high-energy data of the recent bright short GRB 200415A, which was located close to the Sculptor galaxy. Our results suggest that a magnetar giant flare provides the most natural explanation for most observational properties of GRB 200415A, including its location, temporal and spectral features, energy, statistical correlations, and high-energy emissions. On the other hand, the compact star merger GRB model is found to have difficulty reproducing such an event in a nearby distance. Future detections and follow-up observations of similar events are essential to firmly establish the connection between SGR giant flares and a subsample of nearby short GRBs.

title: Effect of the crust on neutron star empirical relations
authors: Márcio Ferreira, Constança Providência
topic: We analyze how the crust equation of state affects several neutron star properties and how it impacts on possible constraints inferred from astrophysical observations. Using three distinct crusts, we generate three sets of model-independent equations of state describing stellar matter from a Taylor expansion around saturation density. The equations of state are thermodynamically consistent, causal, and compatible with astrophysical observations. The relations between the tidal deformability Lmabda and compactness C, Love number k2 and radius of neutron star with mass M are studied, and the effect of the crust equation of state on these relations analyzed. In most of the relations, the impact of the crust equation of state is not larger that 2\%. If, however, a fixed neutron star mass is considered, the relation between the tidal deformability and the radius depends on the crust. We have found that the relation LmabdaMi=[eq] becomes almost exact and crust independent for massive neutron stars. It is shown that it is possible to determine the tidal deformability of an 1.4Msun star from the GW179817 effective tidal deformability Lmabda~ with an accuracy of at least ≈10%. A high correlation between Lmabda~ and the radius of the most massive star of the neutron star binary was confirmed, however, it was demonstrated that the crust has an effect of 14% on this relation. We have found that the relation Lmabda1/Lmabda2=qa depends on Mchirp as..

title: Oscillations of hypermassive compact stars with gravitational radiation and viscosity
authors: Peter B. Rau, Armen Sedrakian
topic: Binary neutron star mergers, such as the multimessenger GW170817 event, may produce hypermassive compact objects which are supported against collapse by the internal circulation of the fluid within the star. We compute their unstable modes of oscillations driven by gravitational wave radiation and shear viscosity, modeling them as triaxial Riemann ellipsoids. We work in a perturbative regime, where the gravitational radiation reaction force is taken into account at 2.5-post-Newtonian order and find unstable modes with dissipation timescales larger 1 ms which are relevant to the transient state of a hypermassive remnant of a merger. We show that the secular instabilities are dominated by gravitational wave radiation. If the shear viscosity is included, it can increase the growth times or even stabilize the unstable modes, but it must have values several orders of magnitude larger than predicted for cold neutron stars.

authors: Jie-Shuang Wang, Zong-Kai Peng, Jin-Hang Zou, Bin-Bin Zhang, Bing Zhang
topic: We perform a stringent search for precursor emission of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) from the Fermi/GBM data and find 16 precursor events with greater 4.5 sigma significance. We find that the durations of the main SGRB emission (TGRB) and the precursor emission (Tpre), as well as the waiting time (Twt) in between, are roughly comparable to each other, with Twt≈2.8T1.2GRB approximately satisfied for most cases except one significant outlier. We also perform spectral analyses to the precursors and SGRBs, and find that the spectra of precursor emission can be fitted with the blackbody, non-thermal cutoff power law and/or power law models. We consider several possible models for precursor emission in SGRBs and find that the luminosity and spectral shape may be explained by the the shock breakout or the photospheric radiation of a fireball launched after the merger for thermal precursors, or magnetospheric interaction between two NSs prior to the merger for non-thermal precursors. For the fireball photospheric model, a matter-dominated jet is preferred and a constraint on the fireball Lorentz factor can be placed as Gamma~30. For the magnetospheric interaction model, jet launching mechanism may be constrained.

title: A Consistent Modeling of Neutrino-driven Wind with Accretion Flow onto a Protoneutron Star and its Implications for Ni Production
authors: Ryo Sawada (Kyoto Sangyo Univ.), Yudai Suwa (Kyoto Sangyo Univ. & YITP, Kyoto Univ.)
topic: Details of the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are not yet fully understood. There is now an increasing number of successful examples of reproducing explosions in the first-principles simulations, which have shown a slow increase of explosion energy. However, it was recently pointed out that the growth rates of the explosion energy of these simulations are insufficient to produce enough 56Ni mass to account for observations. We refer to this issue as the `nickel mass problem' (Ni problem, hereafter) in this paper. The neutrino-driven wind is suggested as one of the most promising candidates for the solution to the Ni problem, in literature. In this paper, we first built a consistent model of the neutrino-driven wind with an accretion flow onto a protoneutron star (PNS), by connecting a steady-state solution of the neutrino-driven wind and a phenomenological mass accretion model. Our conclusion is that it is difficult to solve the Ni problem, by continuous injection of 56Ni by the neutrino-driven wind. We suggest that the total amount of synthesized 56Ni can be estimated robustly if simulations are followed up to ~2 seconds.

title: Gravitational Waves from Core-Collapse Supernovae
authors: Ernazar Abdikamalov, Giulia Pagliaroli, David Radice
topic: We summarize our current understanding of gravitational wave emission from core-collapse supernovae. We review the established results from multi-dimensional simulations and, wherever possible, provide back-of-the-envelope calculations to highlight the underlying physical principles. The gravitational waves are predominantly emitted by protoneutron star oscillations. In slowly rotating cases, which represent the most common type of the supernovae, the oscillations are excited by multi-dimensional hydrodynamic instabilities, while in rare rapidly rotating cases, the protoneutron star is born with an oblate deformation due to the centrifugal force. The gravitational wave signal may be marginally visible with current detectors for a source within our galaxy, while future third-generation instruments will enable more robust and detailed observations. The rapidly rotating models that develop non-axisymmetric instabilities may be visible up to a megaparsec distance with the third-generation detectors. Finally, we discuss strategies for multi-messenger observations of supernovae.

title: Systematics of prompt black-hole formation in neutron star mergers
authors: Andreas Bauswein, Sebastian Blacker, Georgios Lioutas, Theodoros Soultanis, Vimal Vijayan, Nikolaos Stergioulas
topic: This study addresses the collapse behavior of neutron star (NS) mergers expressed through the binary threshold mass Mthres for prompt black hole (BH) formation, which we determine by relativistic hydrodynamical simulations for a set of 40 equation of state (EoS) models. Mthres can be well described by various fit formulae involving stellar parameters of nonrotating NSs. Using these relations we compute which constraints on NS radii and the tidal deformability are set by current and future merger detections revealing information about the merger product. We systematically investigate the impact of the binary mass ratio q=M1/M2 and assemble different fits, which may be applicable in different situations. We find fit formulae for Mthres including an explicit q dependence, which are valid in a broad range of 0.7<=q<=1 and which are nearly as tight as relations for fixed mass ratios. For most EoS models except for some extreme cases the threshold mass of asymmetric mergers is equal or smaller than the one of equal-mass binaries. Generally, the impact of the binary mass asymmetry on M_thres becomes stronger with more extreme mass ratios, while Mthres is approximately constant for small deviations from q=1, i.e. for 0.85<=q<=1.

topic: The mergers of binary neutron stars, as well as black hole-neutron star systems, are expected to produce an electromagnetic counterpart that can be analyzed to infer the element synthesis that occurred in these events. We investigate one source of uncertainties pertinent to lanthanide-rich outflows: the nuclear inputs to rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis calculations. We begin by examining thirty-two different combinations of nuclear inputs: eight mass models, two types of spontaneous fission rates, and two types of fission daughter product distributions. We find that such nuclear physics uncertainties typically generate at least one order of magnitude uncertainty in key quantities such as the nuclear heating (one and a half orders of magnitude at one day post-merger), the bolometric luminosity (one order of magnitude at five days post-merger), and the inferred mass of material from the bolometric luminosity (factor of eight when considering the eight to ten days region). Since particular nuclear processes are critical for determining the electromagnetic signal, we provide tables of key nuclei undergoing β-decay, α-decay, and spontaneous fission important for heating at different times, identifying decays that are common among the many nuclear input combinations.

title: Gravitational wave friction in light of GW170817 and GW190521
authors: S. Mastrogiovanni, L. Haegel, C. Karathanasis, I. Magana-Hernandez, D. A. Steer
topic: We use the gravitational wave (GW) events GW170817 and GW190521, together with their proposed electromagnetic counterparts, to constrain cosmological parameters and theories of gravity beyond General Relativity (GR). In particular we consider models with a time-varying Planck mass, large extra-dimensions, and a phenomenological parametrization covering several beyond-GR theories. In all three cases, this introduces a friction term into the GW propagation equation, effectively modifying the GW luminosity distance. We set constraints on LambdaCDM parameters and GR deviation parameters using two sets of priors on the Hubble constant and matter energy density. With priors set to the measured Planck's mission values, we find that with the inclusion of GW190521, the two GR deviation parameters constraints improves by a factor ∼10, we report a number of spacetime dimensions compatible with 4 with an precision of 2.5% (at 95\% CL) and an upper limit to the variation of Netwon's constant at the epoch of GW170817 les20%. With wide priors on the Hubble constant and matter energy density, we show that it is still possible to constrain the lambdaCDM parameters and GR deviation parameters conjointly from GW170817 and GW190521 obtaining constraints on GR deviation parameters which are a factor 2−6 worse than the results using restricted priors on LambdaCDM parameters.

title: Nucleosynthesis in magneto-rotational supernovae
authors: Moritz Reichert, Martin Obergaulinger, Marius Eichler, Miguel-Ángel Aloy, Almudena Arcones
topic: We present the nucleosynthesis from magneto-rotational supernovae (MR-SN) including neutrino-driven and magneto-rotational-driven ejecta based, for the first time, on two-dimensional simulations with accurate neutrino transport. The models analysed here have different rotation and magnetic fields, allowing us to explore the impact of these two key ingredients. The accurate neutrino transport of the simulations is critical to analyse the slightly neutron rich and proton rich ejecta that are similar to the, also neutrino-driven, ejecta in standard supernovae. In the model with strong magnetic field, the r-process produces heavy elements up to the third r-process peak (A~195), in agreement with previous works. This model presents a jet-like explosion with proton-rich jets surrounded by neutron rich material where the r-process occurs. We have estimated a lower limit for 56Ni of 2.5*10-2Msun, which is still well below the expected hypernova value. Longer simulations including the accretion disk evolution are required to get a final prediction. In addition, we have found that the late evolution is critical in a model with weak magnetic field in which lately ejected neutron rich matter produces elements up to the second r-process peak. Even if we cannot yet provide conclusions for hypernova nucleosynthesis, our results agree with observations of old stars and radioactive isotopes in supernova remnants. This makes MR-SNe a good additional scenario to neutron star mergers for the synthesis of heavy elements and brings us closer to understand their origin and the role of MR-SNe in the early galaxy nucleosynthesis.

title: Energy-momentum tensor of special relativistic fluids and Connection of relativistic and non-relativistic fluids in the new scaling
authors: Mahboobe Moeen Moghaddas
topic: In this paper, the relativistic fluids with the negligible magnetic field in the flat metric are studied. The iso-dimension scale in introduced, in this scale, all similar components of a variable have the same dimension. Also, the components of shear, bulk and heat flux tensors and the components of energy-momentum tensors are calculated in the cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems, all these components are derived in the iso-dimension scale. The non-relativistic shear, bulk and heat flux tensors and the components of energy-momentum tensor are derived in the limit of the relativistic fluids. Also, the connection of relativistic and non-relativistic fluids are seen. So, some distinctions of relativistic and non-relativistic fluids are displayed, for example in the relativistic fluids, the time derivative of velocity is created the shear stress tensor and derivative of velocity and temperature is created the heat flux energy-momentum tensor, etc.

title: Properties of the remnant disk and the dynamical ejecta produced in low-mass black hole-neutron star mergers
authors: Kota Hayashi, Kyohei Kawaguchi, Kenta Kiuchi, Koutarou Kyutoku, Masaru Shibata
topic: We systematically perform numerical-relativity simulations for low-mass black hole-neutron star mergers for the models with seven mass ratios Q=MBH/MNS ranging from 1.5 to 4.4, and three neutron-star equations of state, focusing on properties of matter remaining outside the black hole and ejected dynamically during the merger. We pay particular attention to the dependence on the mass ratio of the binaries. It is found that the rest mass remaining outside the apparent horizon after the merger depends only weakly on the mass ratio for the models with low mass ratios. It is also clarified that the rest mass of the ejecta has a peak at Q~3, and decreases steeply as the mass ratio decreases for the low mass-ratio case. We present a novel analysis method for the behavior of matter during the merger, focusing on the matter distribution in the phase space of specific energy and specific angular momentum. Then we model the matter distribution during and after the merger. Using the result of the analysis, we discuss the properties of the ejecta.

title: A Possible kilonova powered by magnetic wind from a newborn black hole
authors: Shuai-Bing Ma, Wei Xie, Bin Liao, Bin-Bin Zhang, Hou-Jun Lü, Yu Liu, Wei-Hua Lei
topic: The merger of binary neutron stars (NS-NS) as the progenitor of short Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been confirmed by the discovery of the association of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 with GRB 170817A. However, the merger product of binary NS remains an open question. An X-ray plateau followed by a steep decay ("internal plateau") has been found in some short GRBs, implying that a supra-massive magnetar operates as the merger remnant and then collapses into a newborn black hole (BH) at the end of the plateau. X-ray bump or second-plateau following the "internal plateau" is considered as the expected signature from the fallback accretion onto this newborn BH through Blandford-Znajek mechanism (BZ) mechanism. At the same time, a nearly isotropic wind energy driven by Blandford-Payne mechanism (BP) from the newborn BH's disk can produce a bright kilonova. Therefore, the bright kilonova observation for a short GRB with "internal plateau" (and followed by X-ray bump or second-plateau) provides further evidence for this scenario. In this paper, we find that GRB 160821B is a candidate of such a case, and the kilonova emission of GRB 160821B is possibly powered by the BP wind form a newborn BH. Future GW detection of GRB 160821B-like events may provide further support to this scenario, enable us to investigate the properties of the magnetar and the newborn BH, and constrain the equation of state of neutron stars.

title: Gravito-magnetic instabilities of Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics
authors: Hyerim Noh, Jai-chan Hwang
topic: We study gravito-magnetic instabilities of a static homogeneous medium with an aligned magnetic field in the two contexts of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD): first, MHD with post-Newtonian (PN) corrections, and second, special relativistic (SR) MHD with weak gravity. The analysis in the PN MHD is made without taking the temporal gauge condition, thus results are gauge-invariant. The PN corrections of the internal energy, pressure, sound velocity and the Alfvén velocity lower the critical (Jeans) wavelength. {All relativistic effects tend to destabilize the system.} Although the SR MHD with weak gravity is presented in the harmonic gauge, in the presence of gravity the stability analysis is strictly valid to Newtonian order. In the absence of gravity, the SR MHD is independent of the gauge condition. We present the plane wave velocities and the stability criteria in both cases.

title: Reconstructing Masses of Merging Neutron Stars from Stellar R-Process Abundance Signatures
authors: Erika M. Holmbeck, Anna Frebel, G. C. McLaughlin, Rebecca Surman, Rodrigo Fernandez, Brian D. Metzger, Matthew R. Mumpower, Trevor M. Sprouse
topic: Neutron star mergers (NSMs) are promising astrophysical sites for the rapid neutron-capture ("r-") process, but can their integrated yields explain the majority of heavy-element material in the Galaxy? One method to address this question has utilized a forward approach that propagates NSM rates and yields along with stellar formation rates, in the end comparing those results with observed chemical abundances of r-process-rich, metal-poor stars. In this work, we take the inverse approach by utilizing r-process-element abundance ratios of metal-poor stars as input to reconstruct the properties---especially the masses---of the neutron star (NS) binary progenitors of the r-process stars. This novel analysis provides an independent avenue for studying the population of the original neutron star binary systems that merged and produced the r-process material incorporated in Galactic metal-poor halo stars. We use ratios of elements typically associated with the limited-r process and the actinide region to those in the lanthanide region (i.e., Zr/Dy and Th/Dy) to probe the NS masses of the progenitor merger. We find that NSMs can account for all r-process material in metal-poor stars that display r-process signatures, while simultaneously reproducing the present-day distribution of double-NS (DNS) systems. However, the most r-process enhanced stars (the r-II stars) on their own would require progenitor NSMs of very asymmetric systems that are distinctly different from present ones in the Galaxy. As this analysis is model-dependent, we also explore variations in line with future expectation regarding potential theoretical and observational updates, and comment on how these variations impact our results.

authors: Maria Giovanna Dainotti, Aleksander Lenart, Giuseppe Sarracino, Shigehiro Nagataki, Salvatore Capozziello, Nissim Fraija
topic: A large fraction of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) lightcurves (LCs) shows X-ray plateaus. We analyze all GRBs with known redshifts presenting plateaus observed by \emph{The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} from its launch until August 2019. The fundamental plane relation between the rest-frame time and X-ray luminosity at the end of the plateau emission and the peak prompt luminosity holds for all the GRB classes when selection biases and cosmological evolutions are applied. We have discovered two important findings: 1) a new class of Long GRBs with good data coverage: the Platinum Sample; 2) the Platinum, the SNe-LGRB and the KN-SGRB samples, the second sample composed of GRBs associated spectroscopically with the SNe Ib,c, the third sample composed by 8 GRBs associated with Kilonovae or where there could have been such an association, yield the smallest intrinsic scatter. Furthermore, the distance from the Gold fundamental plane is a crucial discriminant among classes. In fact, we find that the distributions of the distances of the SNe-LGRB, SNe-LGRB-ABC, KN-SGRBs and SGRBs samples from the Gold fundamental plane are statistically different from the distribution of the Gold GRBs' distances from the Gold fundamental plane with and without considering evolution cases.

title: The impact of turbulent mixing on the galactic r-process enrichment by binary neutron star mergers across the entire metallicity range
authors: Irina Dvorkin, Frédéric Daigne, Stéphane Goriely, Elisabeth Vangioni, Joseph Silk
topic: We study the enrichment of the interstellar medium with rapid neutron capture (r-process) elements produced in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers using a semi-analytic model of the evolution of a Milky-Way-like galaxy in which we implemented merger rates and time delay distributions of BNS mergers consistent with the latest population synthesis models. In order to study the dispersion of the relative abundances of r-process elements and iron, we applied a turbulent mixing scheme, where the freshly synthesized elements are gradually dispersed in the interstellar medium. We show that within our model the abundances observed in Milky-Way stars, in particular the scatter at low metallicities, can be entirely explained by BNS mergers. Our results suggest that binary neutron star mergers could be the dominant source of r-process elements in low-metallicity environments, and can potentially also be the main source of r-process elements in disk stars at solar metallicity.

title: MHD Turbulence: A Biased Review
authors: Alexander A. Schekochihin (Oxford)
topic: This review puts the developments of the last few years in the context of the canonical time line (Kolmogorov to Iroshnikov-Kraichnan to Goldreich-Sridhar to Boldyrev). It is argued that Beresnyak's objection that Boldyrev's alignment theory violates the RMHD rescaling symmetry can be reconciled with alignment if the latter is understood as an intermittency effect. Boldyrev's scalings, recovered in this interpretation, are thus an example of a physical theory of intermittency in a turbulent system. Emergence of aligned structures brings in reconnection physics, so the theory of MHD turbulence intertwines with the physics of tearing and current-sheet disruption. Recent work on this by Loureiro, Mallet et al. is reviewed and it is argued that we finally have a reasonably complete picture of MHD cascade all the way to the dissipation scale. This picture appears to reconcile Beresnyak's Kolmogorov scaling of the dissipation cutoff with Boldyrev's aligned cascade.

title: Spin-polarized β-stable neutron star matter: the nuclear symmetry energy and GW170817 constraint
authors: Ngo Hai Tan, Dao T. Khoa, Doan Thi Loan
topic: Magnetic field of rotating pulsar might be so strong that the equation of state (EOS) of neutron star (NS) matter is significantly affected by the spin polarization of baryons. In the present work, the EOS of the spin-polarized nuclear matter is investigated in the nonrelativistic Hartree-Fock formalism, using a realistic density dependent nucleon-nucleon interaction with its spin and spin-isospin dependence accurately adjusted to the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock results for the spin-polarized nuclear matter. The nuclear symmetry energy and proton fraction are found to increase significantly with the increasing spin polarization of baryons, leading to a larger probability of the direct Urca process in the cooling of magnetar.

authors: X. L. Zhang, C. T. Zhang, X. J. Li, F. F. S, X. F. Dong, H. Y. Chang, Z. B. Zhang
topic: Thanks to more and more gamma-ray bursts with measured redshift and extended emission detected by the recent space telescopes, it is urgent and possible to check whether those previous energy correlations still satisfy for the particular sample involving only the bursts accompanied by tail radiations. Using 20 long and 22 short bursts with extended emission, we find that the popular gamma-ray energy correlations of the intrinsic peak energy versus the isotropic energy (Amati relation) and the intrinsic peak energy versus the peak luminosity (Yonetoku relation) do exist in either short or long bursts. However, these gamma-ray bursts with extended emissions are much better to be reclassified into two subgroups of E-I and E-II that make the above energy correlations more tight. As proposed by Zhang et al. (2018), the energy correlations can be utilized to distinguish these kinds of gamma-ray bursts in the plane of bolometric fluence versus peak energy as well. Interestingly, the peculiar short GRB 170817A belongs to the E-I group in the fluence versus peak energy plane, but it is an outlier of both Amati and Yonetoku relations even though the off-axis effect has been corrected.

title: Hybrid stars in the light of the merging event GW170817
authors: Alessandro Parisi, C. Vásquez Flores, C. Henrique Lenzi, Chian-Shu Chen, Germán Lugones
topic: We study quark-hadron hybrid stars with sharp phase transitions assuming that phase conversions at the interface are slow. Hadronic matter is described by a set of equations of state (EoS) based on the chiral effective field theory and quark matter by a generic bag model. Due to slow conversions at the interface, there is an extended region of stable hybrid stars with central densities above the density of the maximum mass star. We explore systematically the role of the transition pressure and the energy-density jump Δϵ at the interface on some global properties of hybrid stars. ... We also find that the LIGO/Virgo constrain (at 90% level) and the 2Msun requirement can be simultaneously fulfilled in a scenario where all hybrid configurations have masses larger than 1.6Msun and the hadronic EoS is not too stiff, such as several of our hybrid models involving a hadronic EoS of intermediate stiffness. In such scenario hybrid stars may exist in Nature but both objects in GW170817 were hadronic stars.

title: Modelling the prompt optical emission of GRB 180325A: the evolution of a spike from the optical to gamma-rays
authors: Rosa L. Becerra, Fabio De Colle, Jorge Cantó, Susana Lizano et al
topic: The transition from prompt to the afterglow emission is one of the most exciting and least understood phases in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Correlations among optical, X-ray and gamma-ray emission in GRBs have been explored, to attempt to answer whether the earliest optical emission comes from internal and/or external shocks. We present optical photometric observations of GRB 180325A collected with the TAROT and RATIR ground-based telescopes. These observations show two strong optical flashes with separate peaks at ~50s and ~120s, followed by a temporally extended optical emission. We also present X-rays and gamma-ray observations of GRB 180325A, detected by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and X-ray Telescope (XRT), on the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory, which both observed a narrow flash at ~80s. We show that the prompt gamma- and X-ray early emission shares similar temporal and spectral features consistent with internal dissipation within the relativistic outflow (e.g. by internal shocks or magnetic reconnection), while the early optical flashes are likely generated by the reverse shock that decelerates the ejecta as it sweeps up the external medium.

title: Fast Parameter Estimation of Binary Mergers for Multimessenger Followup
authors: Daniel Finstad, Duncan A. Brown
topic: Significant human and observational resources have been dedicated to electromagnetic followup of gravitational-wave events detected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo. As the sensitivity of LIGO and Virgo improves, the rate of sources detected will increase. Margalit & Metzger (2019; arXiv:1904.11995) have suggested that it may be necessary to prioritize observations of future events. Optimal prioritization requires a rapid measurement of a gravitational-wave event's masses and spins, as these can determine the nature of any electromagnetic emission. We extend the relative binning method of Zackay et al. (2018; arXiv:1806.08792) to a coherent detector-network statistic.

title: A Standard Siren Cosmological Measurement from the Potential GW190521 Electromagnetic Counterpart ZTF19abanrhr
authors: Hsin-Yu Chen, Carl-Johan Haster, Salvatore Vitale, Will M. Farr, Maximiliano Isi
topic: The identification of the electromagnetic counterpart candidate ZTF19abanrhr to the binary black hole merger GW190521 opens the possibility to infer cosmological parameters from this standard siren with a uniquely identified host galaxy. The distant merger allows for cosmological inference beyond the Hubble constant. Here we show that the three-dimensional spatial location of ZTF19abanrhr calculated from the electromagnetic data remains consistent with the updated sky localization of GW190521 provided by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration. If ZTF19abanrhr is associated with the GW190521 merger and assuming a flat wCDM model we find that H0=48+24-10 km/s/Mpc, Ωm=0.39+0.38−0.29, and w0=-1.29+0.63-0.50 (median and 68% credible interval). If we use the Hubble constant value inferred from another gravitational-wave event, GW170817, as a prior for our analysis, together with assumption of a flat LambdaCDM and the model-independent constraint on the physical matter density ωm from Planck, we find H0=69.18.7-6.0 km/s/Mpc.

topic: We report on results of spectropolarimetry of the afterglow of the long gamma-ray burst GRB 191221B, obtained with SALT/RSS and VLT/FORS2, as well as photometry from two telescopes in the MASTER Global Robotic Network, at the MASTER-SAAO (South Africa) and MASTER-OAFA (Argentina) stations. Prompt optical emission was detected by MASTER-SAAO 38 s after the alert, which dimmed from a magnitude (white-light) of ~10 to 16.2 mag over a period of ~10 ks, followed by a plateau phase lasting ~10 ks and then a decline to ~18 mag after 80 ks. The light curve shows complex structure, with four or five distinct breaks in the power-law decline rate. SALT/RSS linear spectropolarimetry of the afterglow began ~2.9 h after the burst, during the early part of the plateau phase of the light curve. Absorption lines seen at ~6010Å and 5490Å are identified with the Mg II 2799Å line from the host galaxy at z=1.15 and an intervening system located at z=0.96.

title: Core-Collapse Supernova Explosion Theory
authors: Adam Burrows, David Vartanyan
topic: Most supernova explosions accompany the death of a massive star. These explosions give birth to neutron stars and black holes and eject solar masses of heavy elements. However, determining the mechanism of explosion has been a half-century journey of great complexity. In this paper, we present our perspective of the status of this theoretical quest and the physics and astrophysics upon which its resolution seems to depend. The delayed neutrino-heating mechanism is emerging as a robust solution, but there remain many issues to address, not the least of which involves the chaos of the dynamics, before victory can unambiguously be declared. It is impossible to review in detail all aspects of this multi-faceted, more-than-half-century-long theoretical quest. Rather, we here map out the major ingredients of explosion and the emerging systematics of the observables with progenitor mass, as we currently see them. Our discussion will of necessity be speculative in parts, and many of the ideas may not survive future scrutiny.

topic: The low frequency sensitivity on the orders of a few Hz in future gravitational-wave observatories will enable the detection of gravitational wave signals of very long duration. The runtime of parameter estimation with these long waveforms can be months even years, which make it impractical with existing Bayesian inference pipelines. Reduced order modelling and reduced order quadrature integration rules have recently been exploited as promising techniques that can greatly reduce parameter estimation computational costs. We describe a Python-based reduced order quadrature building code named PyROQ that builds the reduced order quadrature data needed to accelerate the parameter estimation of gravitational waves.

title: Constraining neutron superfluidity with r-mode physics
authors: Elena M. Kantor, Mikhail E. Gusakov, Vasiliy A. Dommes
topic: We constrain the parameters of neutron superfluidity in the cores of neutron stars making use of the recently proposed effect of resonance stabilization of r-modes. To this end, we, for the first time, calculate the finite-temperature r-mode spectra for realistic models of rotating superfluid neutron stars, accounting for both muons and neutron-proton entrainment in their interiors. We find that the ordinary (normal) r-mode exhibits avoided crossings with superfluid r-modes at certain stellar temperatures and spin frequencies. Near the avoided crossings, the normal r-mode dissipates strongly, which leads to substantial suppression of the r-mode instability there. The extreme sensitivity of the positions of avoided crossings to the neutron superfluidity model allows us to constrain the latter by confronting the calculated spectra with observations of rapidly rotating neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries.

title: Constraints from LIGO/Virgo and NICER on quark star equation of state
authors: Ang Li, Jin-Liang Jiang, Shao-Peng Tang, Zhi-Qiang Miao, En-Ping Zhou, Ren-Xin Xu
topic: We investigate the quark star equation of state within the Bayesian statistical approach using the widely-used bag model, assuming the strange quark matter is in the color-flavor locked phase. Three types of filters are employed for the posterior distribution: Normal atomic nuclei should not decay into nonstrange quark matter, bulk strange quark matter should be more stable than the most bound atomic nuclei, and the lower limit on the maximum mass MTOV. The likelihood functions incorporate observational constraints from the tidal deformability measurement of the GW170817 binary merger by LIGO/Virgo and the measurements of PSR J0030+0451s mass and radius by NICER. The 90% posterior credible boundary around the most probable values of the quark star maximum mass is found to be MTOV=2.15+0.16-0.12Msum, with the radius and tidal deformability of a canonical 1.4Msun star being R1.4=11.52+0.51-0.46km and Λ1.4=670+230−160, respectively. Nevertheless, the color superconductivity gap is poorly constrained by those observed global star properties, and no clear evidence about the sound speed behavior in strange quark matter is manifested. A possible probe of the quark pairing gap through future tidal deformability measurement of massive quark stars (close to MTOV) is also discussed.

title: LOC program for line radiative transfer
authors: M. Juvela
topic: Radiative transfer modelling is part of many astrophysical numerical simulations. It is also used by itself, to make synthetic observations based on models and to assist direct analysis of observations.
Our aim is to provide a line radiative transfer (RT) program that makes good use of multi-core CPUs and GPUs. Parallelisation is essential to speed up computations and to enable the tackling of large modelling tasks with personal computers.
The program LOC is based on ray-tracing (i.e. not Monte Carlo) and uses standard accelerated lambda iteration (ALI) methods for faster convergence. The program works on 1D and 3D grids. The 1D version makes use of symmetries to speed up the RT calculations. The 3D version works with octree grids and, to enable calculations with large models, is optimised for low memory usage.
Tests show that LOC gives results that are in agreement with other RT codes to within ~2%. This is typical of code-to-code differences, which often are related to different interpretations of the model set-up. LOC run times compare favourably especially with those of Monte Carlo codes. In 1D tests, LOC runs were by up to a factor ~20 faster on a GPU than on a single CPU core. In spite of the complex path calculations, up to ~10 speed-up was observed also for 3D models using octree discretisation. Modern GPUs enable calculations of models with up to hundreds of millions of cells.

title: On the delay times of merging double neutron stars
authors: Laura Greggio, Paolo Simonetti, Francesca Matteucci
topic: The merging rate of double neutron stars (DNS) has a great impact on many astrophysical issues, including the interpretation of gravitational waves signals, of the short Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), and of the chemical properties of stars in galaxies. Such rate depends on the distribution of the delay times (DDT) of the merging events. In this paper we derive a theoretical DDT of merging DNS following from the characteristics of the clock controlling their evolution. We show that the shape of the DDT is governed by a few key parameters, primarily the lower limit and the slope of the distribution of the separation of the DNS systems at birth. With a parametric approach we investigate on the observational constraints on the DDT from the cosmic rate of short GRBs and the Europium to Iron ratio in Milky Way stars, taken as tracer of the products of the explosion. We find that the local rate of DNS merging requires that about 1 percent of neutron stars progenitors live in binary systems which end their evolution as merging DNS within a Hubble time. The redshift distribution of short GRBs does not yet provide a strong constraint on the shape of the DDT, although the best fitting models have a shallow DDT. The chemical pattern in Milky Way stars requires an additional source of Europium besides the products from merging DNS, which weakens the related requirement on the DDT. At present both constraints can be matched with the same DDT for merging DNS.

The variation in the radius at the canonical mass, R1.4, using different inner crust equation of state (EoS) with different symmetry energy slope parameter is also studied. It is found that although the NS maximum mass and the corresponding radius do not vary much with different slope parameter inner crust EoS, the radius at 1.4Msun follows a linear correlation with the symmetry energy slope parameter for all core parameter sets.

topic: This study presents a comprehensive chemo-dynamical analysis of LAMOST J1109+0754, a bright (V = 12.8), extremely metal-poor (\abund{Fe}{H} = -3.17) star, with a strong \textit{r}-process enhancement (\abund{Eu}{Fe} = +0.94 pm 0.12) We obtain chemical abundances of 31 elements (from lithium to thorium). The abundance ratios (\abund{X}{Fe}) of the light-elements (Z less 30) suggest a massive Population III progenitor in the 13.4-29.5 ,Msun mass range. The heavy-element (30 less Z less 90) abundance pattern of J1109+075 agrees extremely well with the scaled-Solar \textit{r}-process signature. We have developed a novel approach to trace the kinematic history and orbital evolution of J1109+0754 with a c\textbf{O}smologically pived varying Galactic textbftential (the ORIENT) constructed from snapshots of a simulated Milky-Way analog taken from the \texttt{Illustris-TNG} simulation. The orbital evolution within this Milky Way-like galaxy, along with the chemical-abundance pattern implies that J1109+0754 likely originated in a low-mass dwarf galaxy located sim 60\,kpc from the center of the Galaxy, which was accreted ~ 6 - 7\,Gyr ago, and that the star now belongs to the outer-halo population.

title: Mergers of binary neutron star systems: a multi-messenger revolution
authors: Elena Pian
topic: On 17 August 2017, less than two years after the direct detection of gravitational radiation from the merger of two ~30 Msun black holes, a binary neutron star merger was identified as the source of a gravitational wave signal of ~100 s duration that occurred at less than 50 Mpc from Earth. A short GRB was independently identified in the same sky area by the Fermi and INTEGRAL satellites for high energy astrophysics, which turned out to be associated with the gravitational event. Prompt follow-up observations at all wavelengths led first to the detection of an optical and infrared source located in the spheroidal galaxy NGC4993 and, with a delay of ~10 days, to the detection of radio and X-ray signals. This paper revisits these observations and focusses on the early optical/infrared source, which was thermal in nature and powered by the radioactive decay of the unstable isotopes of elements synthesized via rapid neutron capture during the merger and in the phases immediately following it. The far-reaching consequences of this event for cosmic nucleosynthesis and for the history of heavy elements formation in the Universe are also illustrated.

topic: We show the existence and investigate the location of the special point (SP) in which hybrid neutron star mass-radius (M-R) curves have to cross each other when they belong to a class of hybrid equation of state (EoS) constructed with generic constant--speed--of--sound (CSS) quark matter models for which the onset deconfinement is varied. We demonstrate that for a three-parameter CSS model the position of the SP in the M-R diagram is largely independent of the choice of the hadronic EoS, but in dependence on the stiffness of the quark matter EoS it spans a region that we identify. We find that the difference between the maximum mass and the SP mass depends on the mass at the onset of deconfinement so that an upper limit of 0.19 Msun for this difference is obtained from which a lower limit on the radius of hybrid stars is deduced.For neutron stars with M less 2.4 Msun this lies within a more constraining lower limit of the neutron star radius from multi-messenger observations. Together with a lower limit on the radius of hadronic stars we identify a region in the M-R diagram which can be occupied only by hybrid stars. Accordingly, we suggest that a NICER radius measurement on the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 in the range of 10.7-11.8 km would indicate that this pulsar is a hybrid neutron star with deconfined quark matter in the inner core.

title: The Population III origin of GW190521
authors: Boyuan Liu, Volker Bromm
topic: We explore the possibility that the recently detected black hole binary (BHB) merger event GW190521 originates from the first generation of massive, metal-free, so-called Population III (Pop III), stars. Based on improved binary statistics derived from N-body simulations of Pop III star clusters, we calculate the merger rate densities of Pop III BHBs similar to GW190521, in two evolution channels: classical binary stellar evolution and dynamical hardening in high-redshift nuclear star clusters. Both channels can explain the observed rate density. But the latter is favoured by better agreement with observation and less restrictions on uncertain parameters. Our analysis also indicates that given the distinct features of the two channels, future observation of BHB mergers similar to GW190521 with third-generation gravitational wave detectors will greatly improve our knowledge of the evolution of Pop III BHBs, especially for their dynamics during cosmic structure formation.

title: Confronting the Magnetar Interpretation of Fast Radio Bursts Through Their Host Galaxy Demographics
authors: Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh, J. Xavier Prochaska, Kasper E. Heintz, Wen-fai Fong
topic: We explore the prompt magnetar progenitor scenario in the context of fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies demographics and offset distributions. Magnetars are neutron stars with strong magnetic fields on the order of 1015 G with a short decay lifetime of less than 104 years. Due to their extremely short lifetimes, magnetars should follow the demographics of galaxies according to their current star-formation rate (SFR). Moreover, we hypothesize that magnetars should follow the SFR profile within galaxies, which we assume to follow an exponential profile. We construct a simple model for the host galaxies of magnetars assuming these events track SFR in all galaxies and compare it to observed properties from a sample of  secure FRB hosts. We find the distribution of observed SFRs is inconsistent with the model at 95% c.l. The offset distribution is consistent with this scenario; however, this could be due to the limited sample size and the seeing limited estimates for the effective radii of the FRB host galaxies.

title: Screening Effects on Electron Capture Rates and Type Ia Supernova Nucleosynthesis
authors: Kanji Mori, Toshio Suzuki, Michio Honma, Michael A. Famiano, Toshitaka Kajino, Motohiko Kusakabe, Baha A. Balantekin
topic: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are believed to be a thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf, but the mass of their progenitors is still an open problem. In near-Chandrasekhar-mass (near-M_Ch) models of SNe Ia, the central density reaches >10^9 g cm^{-3}. The electron chemical potential becomes higher than the Q-values of electron capture (EC) transitions between fp-shell nuclei, so a portion of the available electrons is captured by iron group elements and thus neutron-rich isotopes are formed. Since EC reaction rates are sensitive to the density, the degree of neutronization is a key to distinguish near- and sub-M_Ch models. In order to compare observations and theoretical models, an accurate treatment of EC reactions is necessary. In previous theoretical works, however, effects of electron screening on ECs are ignored. Screening lowers EC rates and thus leads to a higher electron fraction. We implement electron screening on ECs to calculate explosive SN Ia nucleosynthesis in a near-M_Ch single degenerate model.

title: On the formation of GW190814
authors: Wenbin Lu, Paz Beniamini, Clément Bonnerot
topic: The LIGO-Virgo collaboration recently reported a puzzling event, GW190814, with component masses of 23 and 2.6 solar masses. Motivated by the relatively small rate of such a coalescence and the fact that the mass of the secondary is close to the total mass of known binary neutron star (bNS) systems, we propose that GW190814 was a second-generation merger from a hierarchical triple system, i.e., the remnant from the bNS coalescence was able to merge again with the 23 Msun black hole (BH) tertiary. We show that this occurs at a sufficiently high probability provided that the semimajor axis of the outer orbit is less than a few AU at the time of bNS coalescence. It remains to be explored whether the conditions for the formation of such tight triple systems are commonly realized in the Universe, especially in low metallicity (less than 0.1 solar) environments. Our model provides a number of predictions. (1) The spin of the secondary in GW190814-like systems is 0.6 to 0.7. (2) The component mass distribution from a large sample of LIGO sources should have a narrow peak between 2.5 and ~3.5 Msun, whereas the range between ~3.5 and ~5 Msun stays empty (provided that stellar evolution does not generate such BHs in the "mass gap"). (3) About 90% (10%) of GW190814-like events have an eccentricity

title: Simulating the dynamics and non-thermal emission of relativistic magnetised jets I. Dynamics
authors: Dipanjan Mukherjee, Gianluigi Bodo, Andrea Mignone, Paola Rossi, Bhargav Vaidya
topic: We have performed magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of relativistic jets from supermassive blackholes over a few tens of kpc for a range of jet parameters. One of the primary aims were to investigate the effect of different MHD instabilities on the jet dynamics and their dependence on the choice of jet parameters. We find that two dominant MHD instabilities affect the dynamics of the jet, small scale Kelvin- Helmholtz (KH) modes and large scale kink modes, whose evolution depend on internal jet parameters like the Lorentz factor, the ratio of the density and pressure to the external medium and the magnetisation and hence consequently on the jet power. Low power jets are susceptible to both instabilities, kink modes for jets with higher central magnetic field and KH modes for lower magnetisation. Moderate power jets do not show appreciable growth of kink modes, but KH modes develop for lower magnetisation. Higher power jets are generally stable to both instabilities. Such instabilities decelerate and decollimate the jet while inducing turbulence in the cocoon, with consequences on the magnetic field structure. We model the dynamics of the jets following a generalised treatment of the Begelman-Cioffi relations which we present here.

title: Plasma kinetic effects in relativistic radiation mediated shocks
authors: Amir Levinson
topic: Fast shocks that form in optically thick media are mediated by Compton scattering and, if relativistic, pair creation. Since the radiation force acts primarily on electrons and positrons, the question arises of how the force is mediated to the ions which are the dominant carriers of the shock energy. It has been widely thought that a small charge separation induced by the radiation force generates electric field inside the shock that decelerates the ions. In this paper we argue that, while this is true in sub-relativistic shocks which are devoid of positrons, in relativistic radiation mediated shocks (RRMS), which are dominated by newly created e+e− pairs, additional coupling is needed, owing to the opposite electric force acting on electrons and positrons. Specifically, we show that dissipation of the ions energy must involve collective plasma interactions. By constructing a multi-fluid model for RRMS that incorporates friction forces, we estimate that momentum transfer between electrons and positrons (and/or ions) via collective interactions on scales of tens to thousands proton skin depths

title: Can we constrain the aftermath of binary neutron star mergers with short gamma-ray bursts?
authors: Barbara Patricelli, Maria Grazia Bernardini
topic: The joint observation of GW170817 and GRB170817A proved that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are progenitors of short Gamma-ray Bursts (SGRB): this established a direct link between the still unsettled SGRB central engine and the outcome of BNS mergers, whose nature depends on the equation of state (EOS) and on the masses of the NSs. We propose a novel method to probe the central engine of SGRBs based on this link. We produce an extended catalog of BNS mergers by combining recent theoretically predicted BNS merger rate as a function of redshift and the NS mass distribution inferred from measurements of Galactic BNSs. We use this catalog to predict the number of BNS systems ending as magnetars (stable or Supramassive NS) or BHs (formed promptly or after the collapse of a hypermassive NS) for different EOSs, and we compare these outcomes with the observed rate of SGRBs. Despite the uncertainties mainly related to the poor knowledge of the SGRB jet structure, we find that for most EOSs the rate of magnetars produced after BNS mergers is sufficient to power all the SGRBs, while scenarios with only BHs as possible central engine seems to be disfavoured.

title: Magnetic Ergostars, Jet Formation and Gamma-Ray Bursts: Ergoregions versus Horizons
authors: Milton Ruiz, Antonios Tsokaros, Stuart L. Shapiro, Kyle C. Nelli, Sam Qunell
topic: We perform the first fully general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of dynamically stable hypermassive neutron stars with and without ergoregions to assess the impact of ergoregions on launching magnetically--driven outflows. The hypermassive neutron stars are modeled by a compressible and causal equation of state and are initially endowed with a dipolar magnetic field extending from the stellar interior into its exterior. We find that, after a few Alfvén times, magnetic field lines in the ergostar (star that contains ergoregions) and the normal star have been tightly wound in both cases into a helical funnel within which matter begins to flow outward. The maximum Lorentz factor in the outflow is Gamma = 2.5, while the force-free parameter holds at B2/8pi prho 0 leq 10. These values are incompatible with highly relativistic, magnetically-driven outflows (jets) and short γ-ray bursts. We compare these results with those of a spinning black hole surrounded by a magnetized, massless accretion disk that launches a bona fide jet. Our simulations suggest that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism for launching relativistic jets only operates when a black hole is present, though the Poynting luminosity in all cases is comparable. Therefore, one cannot distinguish a magnetized, accreting black hole from a magnetized hypermassive neutron star in the so-called mass-gap based solely on the value of the observed Poynting luminosity.

topic: We study the production of light elements (Z less 20) in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers by combining detailed nucleosynthesis calculations with the outcome of numerical relativity merger simulations. We explore different microphysical equations of state and binary mass ratios, and find that hydrogen and helium are the most abundant light elements. For both elements, the decay of free neutrons is the driving nuclear reaction. Hydrogen is produced in extremely fast expanding ejecta while helium is synthesized in association with heavy r-process elements. By computing synthetic spectra, we find that the possibility of detecting hydrogen and helium features in kilonova spectra is very unlikely.

title: Rank-3 Moment Closures in General Relativistic Neutrino Transport
authors: Sherwood Richers
topic: Many modern simulations of accretion disks use moment-based methods for radiation transport to determine the thermal evolution of the disk and the properties of the ejected matter. The popular M1 scheme evolves the rank-0 and rank-1 moments requires an analytic approximation for the rank-2 and higher tensors. We present the open-source Monte Carlo steady-state general-relativistic neutrino transport code SedonuGR, which we use to asses fundamental analytic closure assumptions, quantify proposed closure errors, and test an extension of the MEFD closure to the rank-3 moment. We demonstrate that the fundamental assumptions employed in all analytic closures are strongly violated. This violation is most evident at the interface between the equatorial disk and the evacuated polar regions. Finally, we calculate the neutrino momentum and energy deposition rate from neutrino pair annihilation, and demonstrate that a moment-based annihilation power calculation is accurate to at most ~20% if the rank-2 and higher moments are neglected.

title: Formation of GW190521 via gas accretion onto Population III stellar black hole remnants born in high-redshift minihalos
authors: Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh, Zoltán Haiman
topic: The recent gravitational wave merger event, GW190521, has challenged our understanding of the stellar-mass black hole (BH) formation. The primary and secondary BH are both inferred to fall inside the pair-instability (PI) mass gap. Here we propose that the formation of such binaries is possible through gas accretion onto the BH remnants of Population III (Pop~III) stars born in high-redshift (z greater 10) minihalos. Once the parent halo has grown to the atomic-cooling limit, even brief episodes of gas accretion in the dense central regions of the halo can increase the masses of Pop~III remnant BHs above the PI limit. Starting with a BBH with an initial mass of O(100) Msun we find that it would only need to spend about 100~Myr in the inner few pc of an atomic-cooling halo to accrete about 50~Msun of material and resemble a system similar to GW190521. The dynamical friction timescale for the binary to sink to the dense inner region of its parent halo is comparable or shorter than the accretion timescale required to increase their mass above the PI limit. Once in the core of the halo, the binary can enter a phase of hyper-Eddington accretion, where it would only take a few thousand years to exceed the PI limit through accretion.

title: Neutron stars mergers in a stochastic chemical evolution model: impact of time delay distributions
authors: L. Cavallo, G. Cescutti, F. Matteucci
topic: We study the evolution of the [Eu/Fe] ratio in the Galactic halo by means of a stochastic chemical evolution model considering merging neutron stars as polluters of europium. We improved our previous stochastic chemical evolution model by adding a time delay distribution for the coalescence of the neutron stars, instead of constant delays. The stochastic chemical evolution model can reproduce the trend and the observed spread in the [Eu/Fe] data with neutron star mergers as unique producers if we assume: i) a delay time distribution per event, iii) progenitors of neutron stars in the range 9-50Msun and iv) a constant fraction of massive stars in the initial mass function (0.02) that produce neutron star mergers. Our best model is obtained by relaxing point iv) and assuming a fraction that varies with metallicity. We confirm that the mixed scenario with both merging neutron stars and supernovae as europium producers can provide a good agreement with the data relaxing the constraints on the distribution time delays for the coalescence of neutron stars. Adopting our best model, we also reproduce the dispersion of [Eu/Fe] at a given metallicity, which depends on the fraction of massive stars that produce neutron star mergers. Future high-resolution spectroscopic surveys, such as 4MOST and WEAVE, will produce the necessary statistics to constrain at best this parameter.

topic: We perform three-dimensional (3D) general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations to model the jet break-out from the ejecta expected to be produced in a binary neutron-star merger. The structure of the relativistic outflow from the 3D simulation confirms our previous results from 2D simulations, namely, that a relativistic magnetized outflow breaking out from the merger ejecta exhibits a hollow core of Theta core eq 4 deg, an opening angle of Theta jet geq 10deg, and is accompanied by a wind of ejected matter that will contribute to the kilonova emission. We also compute the non-thermal afterglow emission of the relativistic outflow and fit it to the panchromatic afterglow from GRB170817A, together with the superluminal motion reported from VLBI observations

authors: Thomas W. Baumgarte, Stuart L. Shapiro
topic: We adopt a two-moment formalism, together with a reference-metric approach, to express the equations of relativistic radiation hydrodynamics in a form that is well-suited for numerical implementations in curvilinear coordinates. We illustrate the approach by employing a gray opacity in an optically thick medium. As numerical demonstrations we present results for two test problems, namely stationary, slab-symmetric solutions in flat spacetimes, including shocks, and heated Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse to a black hole. For the latter, we carefully analyze the transition from an initial transient to a post-transient phase that is well described by an analytically-known diffusion solution. We discuss the properties of the numerical solution when rendered in moving-puncture coordinates.

authors: Tania E. Medina-Torrejon, Elisabete M. de Gouveia Dal Pino, Luis H.S. Kadowaki, Grzegorz Kowal, Chandra B. Singh, Yosuke Mizuno
topic: Particle acceleration in magnetized relativistic jets still puzzles theorists, specially when one tries to explain the highly variable emission observed in blazar jets or gamma-ray bursts putting severe constraints on current models. In this work we investigate the acceleration of particles injected in a three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamical jet subject to current driven kink instability (CDKI), which drives turbulence and fast magnetic reconnection. Test protons injected in the nearly stationary snapshots of the jet, experience an exponential acceleration up to a maximum energy. The simulations also reveal a clear association of the accelerated particles with the regions of fast reconnection. In the early stages of the development of the non-linear growth of CDKI in the jet, when there are still no sites of fast reconnection, injected particles are also efficiently accelerated, but by magnetic curvature drift in the wiggling jet spine. However, they have to be injected with an initial energy much larger than that required for particles to accelerate in reconnection sites. Finally, we have also obtained from the simulations an acceleration time due to reconnection with a weak dependence on the particles energy E.

title: Evolution of inspiralling neutron star binaries: effects of tidal interactions and orbital eccentricities
authors: Jie-Shuang Wang, Dong Lai
topic: Neutron star (NS) binaries formed dynamically may have significant eccentricities while emitting gravitational waves (GWs) in the LIGO/VIRGO band. We study tidal effects in such eccentric inspiralling NS binaries using a set of hybrid equations. The NS is modelled as a compressible ellipsoid, which can deform nonlinearly due to tidal forces, while the orbit evolution is treated with the post-Newtonian (PN) theory up to 2.5-PN order. We find that in general, the tidal interaction can accelerate the inspiral, and cause orbital frequency and phase shifts. For circular inspirals, our calculations reproduce previous linear result at large binary separations, but incorporate the dynamical response of the NS at small separations. For eccentric inspirals, the frequency and phase shifts oscillate considerably near pericenter passages, and the oscillating amplitudes increase with eccentricities.

title: Persistent mysteries of jet engines, formation, propagation, and particle acceleration: have they been addressed experimentally?
authors: Eric G. Blackman, Sergey V. Lebedev
topic: The physics of astrophysical jets can be divided into three regimes: (i) engine and launch (ii) propagation and collimation, (iii) dissipation and particle acceleration. Since astrophysical jets comprise a huge range of scales and phenomena, practicality dictates that most studies of jets intentionally or inadvertently focus on one of these regimes, and even therein, one body of work may be simply boundary condition for another. We first discuss long standing persistent mysteries that pertain the physics of each of these regimes, independent of the method used to study them. This discussion makes contact with frontiers of plasma astrophysics more generally. While observations theory, and simulations, and have long been the main tools of the trade, what about laboratory experiments? Jet related experiments have offered controlled studies of specific principles, physical processes, and benchmarks for numerical and theoretical calculations. We discuss what has been done to date on these fronts. Although experiments have indeed helped us to understand certain processes, proof of principle concepts, and benchmarked codes, they have yet to solved an astrophysical jet mystery on their own

title: Impact of magnetic field on neutrino-matter interactions in core-collapse supernova
authors: Takami Kuroda
topic: We explore the impact of magnetic field on neutrino-matter interactions in core-collapse supernova. We first derive the modified source terms for neutrino-nucleon scattering and neutrino absorption and emission processes in the moment formalism. Then we perform full relativistic three-dimensional, magnetorotational core-collapse supernova simulations of a 20 Msun star with spectral neutrino transport. Our simulations treat self-consistently the parity violation effects of magnetic field on the lepton number, energy, and momentum exchanges. The result shows a clear global asymmetry with respect to the equatorial plane in each exchange rate. The asymmetric property arises from two factors: the angle between the neutrino flux and magnetic field and the term, which is parallel to the magnetic field and is also proportional to the deviation of distribution function of neutrinos from thermal equilibrium. The typical correction value amounts to ~1 % relative to the total neutrino-matter interaction rate for the magnetic field strength of ~10 15-16 G

title: Turbulent magnetic-field amplification in the first 10 milliseconds after a binary neutron star merger: comparing high-resolution and large eddy simulations
authors: Ricard Aguilera-Miret, Daniele Viganò, Federico Carrasco, Borja Miñano, Carlos Palenzuela
topic: The detection of binary neutron star mergers represents one of the most important and complex astrophysical discoveries of the recent years. One of the unclear aspects of the problem is the turbulent magnetic field amplification, initially triggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at much smaller scales than any reachable numerical resolution nowadays. Here we present numerical simulations of the first ten milliseconds of a binary neutron star merger. First, we confirm in detail how the simulated amplification depends on the numerical resolution and is distributed on a broad range of scales, as expected from turbulent MHD theory. We find that an initial large-scale magnetic field of 10^11G inside each star is amplified in the remnant to root-mean-square values above 1016G within the first 5 milliseconds for our highest-resolution run. Then, we run large eddy simulations, exploring the performance of the subgrid-scale gradient model, already tested successfully in previous turbulent box simulations. We show that the addition of this model is especially important in the induction equation, since it leads to an amplification of the magnetic field comparable to a higher-resolution run, but with a greatly reduced computational cost. In the first 10 milliseconds, there is no clear hint for an ordered, large-scale magnetic field, which should indeed occur in longer timescales through magnetic winding and the magneto-rotational instability.

title: On the torque exerted by a warped, magnetically threaded accretion disk
authors: Chang Liu, Xiang-Dong Li
topic: Most astrophysical accretion disks are likely to be warped. In X-ray binaries the spin evolution of an accreting neutron star is critically dependent on the interaction between the neutron star magnetic field and the accretion disk. There have been extensive investigations on the accretion torque exerted by a coplanar disk that is magnetically threaded by the magnetic field lines from the neutron stars, but relevant works on warped/tilted accretion disks are still lacking. In this paper we develop a simplified two-component model, in which the disk is comprised of an inner coplanar part and an outer, tilted part. Based on standard assumption on the formation and evolution of the toroidal magnetic field component, we derive the dimensionless torque and show that a warped/titled disk is more likely to spin up the neutron star compared with a coplanar disk.We also discuss the possible influence of various initial parameters on the torque.

The models are representative of evolution in close binaries. A subset, those with presupernova masses in the range, have many properties in common with observed Type Ib and Ic supernovae, including a median ejected mass near... These limits are fainter than some allegedly typical Type Ib and Ic supernovae and could reflect problems in our models or the observational analysis. Helium stars with lower and higher masses also produce interesting transients that may have been observed including fast, faint, blue transients and long, red, faint Type Ic supernovae. New models are specifically presented for SN 2007Y, SN 2007gr, SN 2009jf, LSQ13abf, SN 2008D, and SN 2010X.

authors: Gokul Prem Srinivasaragavan, Maria Giovanna Dainotti, Nissim Fraija, Xavier Hernandez, Shigehiro Nagataki, Luke Bowden, Robert Wagner, Aleksander Lenart
topic: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the most explosive phenomena in the Universe after the Big Bang. A large fraction of GRB lightcurves (LCs) shows X-ray plateaus. We perform the most comprehensive analysis of all GRBs (with known and unknown redshifts) with plateau emission observed by The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from its launch until August 2019. We fit 455 LCs showing a plateau and explore whether these LCs follow closure relations, relations between the temporal and spectral indices of the afterglow, corresponding to 2 distinct astrophysical environments and cooling regimes within the external forward shock (ES) model, and find that the ES model works for the majority of cases. The most favored environments are a constant density interstellar or wind medium with slow cooling. We also confirm the existence of the fundamental plane relation between the rest-frame time and luminosity at the end of the plateau emission and the peak prompt luminosity for this enlarged sample, and test this relation on groups corresponding to the astrophysical environments of our known redshift sample. The plane becomes a crucial discriminant corresponding to these environments in terms of the best fitting parameters and dispersions. Most GRBs for which the closure relations are fulfilled with respect to astrophysical environments have an intrinsic scatter sigma compatible within 1 sigma of that of the Gold GRBs, a subset of long GRBs with relatively flat plateaus. We also find that GRBs satisfying closure relations indicating a fast cooling regime have a lower sigma than ever previously found in literature.

LIGO/Virgo observations provide an independent measure of binary compact remnant masses and several candidate first mass gap objects (either NS or BH) were observed in the O3 science run. We study the formation of BH-NS mergers in the framework of isolated classical binary evolution. We use population synthesis method to evolve binary stars (Population I and II) across cosmic time. We find that with appropriate constraints on the (delayed) supernova engine ~30-40% of LIGO/Virgo BH-NS mergers may host at least one compact object in the gap. The uncertainties in the processes behind compact object formation imply that the fraction of BH-NS systems ejecting mass during the merger is ~0-9%. In our reference we find that only ~0.2% of BH-NS mergers will have any mass ejection, and about the same percentage would produce kilonova bright enough to have a chance to be detected even with a large (Subaru-class) 8m telescope. Interestingly, all these mergers will have both BH and NS in the first mass gap.

title: Is GW190521 the merger of black holes from the first stellar generations?
authors: Eoin J. Farrell, Jose H. Groh, Raphael Hirschi, Laura Murphy, Etienne Kaiser, Sylvia Ekström, Cyril Georgy, Georges Meynet
topic: GW190521 challenges our understanding of the late-stage evolution of massive stars and the effects of the pair-instability in particular. We discuss the possibility that stars at low or zero metallicity could retain most of their hydrogen envelope until the pre-supernova stage, avoid the pulsational pair-instability regime and produce a black hole with a mass in the mass gap by fallback. Models with a metallicity in the range 0-0.0004 have three properties which favour higher BH masses as compared to higher metallicity models. These are (i) lower mass-loss rates during the post-MS phase, (ii) a more compact star disfavouring binary interaction and (iii) possible H-He shell interactions which lower the CO core mass. We conclude that it is possible that GW190521 may be the merger of black holes produced directly by massive stars from the first stellar generations.

title: The Sobolev approximation for radiation transport with line overlap and continuous opacity
authors: Aleksandr Nesterenok
topic: The radiation transport problem in the plane-parallel medium with the large velocity gradient is considered. The Sobolev approximation is used. The effects of continuum absorption and line overlap are taken into account. The photon loss probability functions are calculated and tabulated. Two calculations are performed - for the Gaussian spectral line profile and for the rectangular profile. It is shown that at particular choice of the rectangular profile width the results of the calculations are very close. The evaluated photon loss probability functions may be used in the calculations of energy level populations of OH molecule in the interstellar gas flows.

title: Merging strangeon stars: the ejecta and light curves
authors: X. Y. Lai, C. J. Xia, Y. W. Yu, R. X. Xu
topic: This paper gives the first qualitative description about the evolution of ejecta and find that the ejecta could end up with two components. In the hot environment of the merger, the strangeon nuggets ejected by tidal disruption and hydrodynamical squeezing would suffer from evaporation, in which process particles, such as strangeons, neutrons and protons, are emitted. Taking into account both the evaporation of strangeon nuggets and the decay of strangeons, most of the ejected strangeon nuggets would turn into neutrons and protons within 10 ms, and the dependence of evaporation rate on temperature leads to the two-component ejecta. Light curves are derived for both high and low opacity components, where the former would be ejected from the directions around the equatorial plane, and the latter would be ejected in a broad range of angular directions.

topic: We combine equation of state of dense matter up to twice nuclear saturation density (nsat=0.16fm-3) obtained using chiral effective field theory (xEFT), and recent observations of neutron stars to gain insights about the high-density matter encountered in their cores. A key element in our study is the recent Bayesian analysis of correlated EFT truncation errors based on order-by-order calculations up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in the χEFT expansion. We refine the bounds on the maximum mass imposed by causality at high densities, and provide stringent limits on the maximum and minimum radii of ~1.4Msun and ~2.0Msun stars.

title: Don't fall into the gap: GW190521 as a straddling binary
authors: Maya Fishbach, Daniel E. Holz
topic: black holes cannot be born with masses in the range 50Msun less m less 120Msun. The reported mass of GW190521's primary black hole, falls squarely within this mass gap. We consider the more conservative alternative that GW190521's secondary BH belongs to the population of BHs previously observed by LIGO/Virgo With this prior on m2, we automatically find that the mass of the primary BH has. This is because the total mass of the system is better constrained than the individual masses. As long as the prior odds for a double-mass-gap BBH are smaller than ~1:15, it is more likely that GW190521 straddles the PISN gap.

authors: V. Gayathri, J. Healy, J. Lange, B. O'Brien, M. Szczepanczyk, I. Bartos, M. Campanelli, S. Klimenko, C. Lousto, R. O'Shaughnessy
topic: The stellar-mass black hole merger GW190521 is the heaviest system discovered by LIGO/Virgo so far, with masses unexpected from stellar evolution. The system underwent precession due to its black hole spin orientation, a signature of binaries formed through gravitational capture. Capture through close encounters can also lead to eccentric binary orbits, but this feature is currently difficult to identify due to the lack of suitable gravitational waveforms. No eccentric merger has been reported to date. Here we show that GW190521 is the most consistent with a highly eccentric black hole merger. We carried out 325 numerical relativity simulations to generate an effective ~3x10^4 gravitational waveforms to compare to the observed data, much greater than previously available at high eccentricities. We find that GW190521 is best explained by a high-eccentricity, precessing model with e~0.7. All properties of GW190521 point to its origin being the repeated gravitational capture of black holes, making GW190521 the first of LIGO/Virgo's discoveries whose formation channel is identified.

title: On the Origin of GW190521-like events from repeated black hole mergers in star clusters
authors: Giacomo Fragione, Abraham Loeb, Frederic A. Rasio
topic: LIGO and Virgo have reported the detection of GW190521, from the merger of a binary black hole (BBH) with a total mass around 150 Msun. While current stellar models limit the mass of any black hole (BH) remnant to about 40-50 Msun, more massive BHs can be produced dynamically through repeated mergers in the core of a dense star cluster. The process is limited by the recoil kick (due to anisotropic emission of gravitational radiation) imparted to merger remnants, which can escape the parent cluster, thereby terminating growth. We study the role of the host cluster metallicity and escape speed in the buildup of massive BHs through repeated mergers. Almost independent of host metallicity, we find that a BBH of about 150 Msun could be formed dynamically in any star cluster

authors: Juan Calderón Bustillo, Nicolas Sanchis-Gual, Alejandro Torres-Forné, José A. Font, Avi Vajpeyi, Rory Smith, Carlos Herdeiro, Eugen Radu, Samson H. W. Leong
topic: dvanced LIGO-Virgo reported a short gravitational-wave signal (GW190521) interpreted as a quasi-circular merger of black holes, one populating the pair-instability supernova gap, forming a remnant black hole of Mf~142Msun at a luminosity distance of dL~5.3 Gpc. With barely visible pre-merger emission, however, GW190521 merits further investigation of the pre-merger dynamics and even of the very nature of the colliding objects. We show that GW190521 is consistent with numerically simulated signals from head-on collisions of two (equal mass and spin) horizonless vector boson stars (aka Proca stars), forming a final black hole with Mf=231+13-17Msun, located at a distance of dL=571+348-181 Mpc. The favoured mass for the ultra-light vector boson constituent of the Proca stars is muV=8.72+0.73-0.82x10-13 eV. This provides the first demonstration of close degeneracy between these two theoretical models, for a real gravitational-wave event. Confirmation of the Proca star interpretation, which we find statistically slightly preferred, would provide the first evidence for a long sought dark matter particle.

title: Hyperon Bulk Viscosity in Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Mark G. Alford, Alexander Haber
topic: In this paper we present a computation of bulk viscosity arising from hyperonic processes in matter at densities and temperatures typical of neutron star mergers. To deal with the high temperatures in this environment we go beyond the Fermi surface approximation in our rate calculations and numerically evaluate the full phase space integral. We include processes where quarks move between baryons via meson exchange: these have been largely omitted in previous analyses but provide the dominant contribution to the bulk viscosity. We obtain the dissipation times for harmonic oscillations at the frequencies seen in merger simulations, and find that hyperon bulk viscosity can be highly relevant at densities just below the onset of the first hyperon species and temperatures up to T=5 MeV, with dissipation times as fast as τdiss approx 9 ms.

title: Deformed crystals and torsional oscillations of neutron star crust
authors: A. A. Kozhberov, D. G. Yakovlev
topic: We study breaking stress of deformed Coulomb crystals in a neutron star crust, taking into account electron plasma screening of ion-ion interaction; calculated breaking stress is fitted as a function of electron screening parameter. We apply the results for analyzing torsional oscillation modes in the crust of a non-magnetic star. We present exact analytic expression for the fundamental frequencies of such oscillations and show that the frequencies of all torsional oscillations are insensitive to the presence of the outer neutron star crust. The results can be useful in theoretical modeling of processes involving deformed Coulomb crystals in the crust of neutron stars, such as magnetic field evolution, torsional crustal or thermo-elastic quasi-periodic oscillations of flaring soft gamma-ray repeaters, pulsar glitches. The applicability of the results to soft gamma-ray repeaters is discussed.

title: GW190521: orbital eccentricity and signatures of dynamical formation in a binary black hole merger signal
authors: Isobel M. Romero-Shaw, Paul D. Lasky, Eric Thrane, Juan Calderon Bustillo
topic: Pair instability supernovae are thought to restrict the formation of black holes in the mass range -50 - 135 solar masses. However, black holes with masses within this "high mass gap" are expected to form as the remnants of binary black hole mergers. These remnants can merge again dynamically in densely populated environments such as globular clusters. The hypothesis that the binary black hole merger GW190521 formed dynamically is supported by its high mass. Orbital eccentricity can also be a signature of dynamical formation, since a binary that merges quickly after becoming bound may not circularize before merger. In this work, we measure the orbital eccentricity of GW190521.

title: Constraining the Jet Launching Time of GRB 170817A by Utilizing the Baryon Loading
authors: Jia Ren, Da-Bin Lin, Lu-lu Zhang, Kai Wang, Xiao-yan Li, Xiang-Gao Wang, En-Wei Liang
topic: The observed delay of GRB 170817A relative to GW170817 carries significant information about gamma-ray burst (GRB) physics and is subject to intense debate. In this letter, we put forward an approach to discuss the major source of this time delay. First of all, we use the structured jet model to fit the X-ray/optical/radio afterglows of GRB 170817A together with superluminal motion measured by the Very Long Baseline Interferometry. Our structured jet is modelled with angle-dependent energy and baryon loading. It is found that our model can well fit the afterglows of GRB 170817A. After that, the baryon loading in the jet is inferred based on our fitting results. By comparing the baryon loading to the mass outflow in different stages, we infer that the time lag of the jet launch relative to the merger is less than hundreds or tens of milliseconds. It suggests that the time delay of GRB 170817A relative to GW170817 is defined mostly by the spreading time of the jet propagating to its dissipation radius.

title: Multi-messenger parameter estimation of GW170817: from jet structure to the Hubble constant
authors: Hao Wang, Dimitrios Giannios
topic: The electromagnetic radiation that followed the neutron-star merger event GW170817 revealed that gamma-ray burst afterglows from jets misaligned with our line of sight exhibit a light curve with slowly rising flux. The slope of the rising light curve depends sensitively on the angle of the observer with respect to the jet axis, which is likely to be perpendicular to the merger plane of the neutron star binary. Therefore, the afterglow emission can be used to constrain the inclination of the merging system. Here, we calculate the GRB afterglow emission based on the realistic jet structure derived from general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations of black hole-torus system for the central engine of the gamma-ray burst. Combined with gravitational wave parameter estimation, we fit the multi-epoch afterglow emission of GW170817. We show that with such a jet model, the observing angle can be tightly constrained by multi-messenger observations. The best fit observing angle of GW170817 is Theta_nu=0.38pm0.02 rad. With such a constraint, we can break the degeneracy between inclination angle and luminosity distance in gravitational wave parameter estimation, and substantially increase the precision with which the Hubble constant is constrained by the standard siren method. Our estimation of the distance...  As a result, multi-messenger observations of short-duration gamma-ray bursts, combined with a good theoretical understanding of the jet structure, can be powerful probes of cosmological parameters.

title: 3D modelling of magneto-thermal evolution of neutron stars: method and test cases
authors: Davide De Grandis, Roberto Turolla, Toby S. Wood, Silvia Zane, Roberto Taverna, Konstantinos N. Gourgouliatos
topic: Neutron stars harbour extremely strong magnetic fields within their solid outer crust. The topology of this field strongly influences the surface temperature distribution, and hence the star's observational properties. In this work, we present the first realistic simulations of the coupled crustal magneto-thermal evolution of isolated neutron stars in three dimensions with account for neutrino emission, obtained with the pseudo-spectral code Parody. We investigate both the secular evolution, especially in connection with the onset of instabilities during the Hall phase, and the short-term evolution following episodes of localised energy injection. Simulations show that a resistive tearing instability develops in about a Hall time if the initial toroidal field exceeds similar 10^15 G. This leads to crustal failures because of the huge magnetic stresses coupled with the local temperature enhancement produced by dissipation. Localised heat deposition in the crust results in the appearance of hot spots on the star surface which can exhibit a variety of patterns. Since the transport properties are strongly influenced by the magnetic field, the hot regions tend to drift away and get deformed following the magnetic field lines while cooling. The shapes obtained with our simulations are reminiscent of those recently derived from NICER X-ray observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR J0030+0451.

title: Maximum mass cutoff in the neutron star mass distribution and the prospect of forming supramassive objects in the double neutron star mergers
authors: Dong-Sheng Shao, Shao-Peng Tang, Jin-Liang Jiang, Yi-Zhong Fan
topic: The sample of neutron stars with a measured mass is growing quickly. With the latest sample, we adopt both a flexible Gaussian mixture model and a Gaussian plus Cauchy-Lorentz component model to infer the mass distribution of neutron stars and use the Bayesian model selection to explore evidence for multimodality and a sharp cutoff in the mass distribution. The two models yield rather similar results. Consistent with previous studies, we find evidence for a bimodal distribution together with a cutoff at a mass. If such a cutoff is interpreted as the maximum gravitational mass of nonrotating cold neutron stars, the prospect of forming supramassive remnants is found to be quite promising for the double neutron star mergers with a total gravitational mass less than or equal to 2.7Msun unless the thermal pions could substantially soften the equation of state for the very hot neutron star matter. These supramassive remnants have a typical kinetic rotational energy of approximately.

title: Fast neutrino flavor conversion, ejecta properties, and nucleosynthesis in newly-formed hypermassive remnants of neutron-star mergers
authors: Manu George, Meng-Ru Wu, Irene Tamborra, Ricard Ardevol-Pulpillo, Hans-Thomas Janka
topic: Neutrinos emitted in the coalescence of two neutron stars affect the dynamics of the outflow ejecta and the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. In this work, we analyze the neutrino emission properties and the conditions leading to the growth of flavor instabilities in merger remnants consisting of a hypermassive neutron star and an accretion disk during the first 10 ms after the merger. The analyses are based on hydrodynamical simulations that include a modeling of neutrino emission and absorption effects via the "Improved Leakage-Equilibration-Absorption Scheme" (ILEAS). We also examine the nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements via the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) inside the material ejected during this phase. The dominant emission of nue^- over nue from the merger remnant leads to favorable conditions for the occurrence of fast pairwise flavor conversions of neutrinos, independent of the chosen equation of state or the mass ratio of the binary. The nucleosynthesis outcome is very robust, ranging from the first to the third r-process peaks. In particular, more than 10-5 Msun of strontium are produced in these early ejecta that may account for the GW170817 kilonova observation. We find that the amount of ejecta containing free neutrons after the r-process freeze-out, which may power early-time UV emission, is reduced by roughly a factor of 10 when compared to simulations that do not include weak interactions. Finally, the potential flavor equipartition between all neutrino flavors is mainly found to affect the nucleosynthesis outcome in the polar ejecta within 30 degrees by changing the amount of the produced iron-peak and first-peak nuclei, but it does not alter the lanthanide mass fraction therein.

topic: gamma -ray bursts (GRBs) are short-lived transients releasing a large amount of energy (1051−1053erg) in the keV-MeV energy range. GRBs are thought to originate from internal dissipation of the energy carried by ultra-relativistic jets launched by the remnant of a massive star′s death or a compact binary coalescence. While thousands of GRBs have been observed over the last thirty years, we still have an incomplete understanding of where and how the radiation is generated in the jet. A novel investigation of the GRB emission mechanism, via time-resolved spectral analysis of the X-ray tails of bright GRB pulses, enables us to discover a unique relation between the spectral index and the flux. This relation is incompatible with the long standing scenario invoked to interpret X-ray tails, that is, the delayed arrival of photons from high-latitude parts of the jet. We show that our results provide for the first time evidence of adiabatic cooling and efficient energy exchange between the emitting particles in the relativistic outflows of GRBs.

title: The cosmic merger rate density of compact objects: impact of star formation, metallicity, initial mass function and binary evolution
authors: Filippo Santoliquido, Michela Mapelli, Nicola Giacobbo, Yann Bouffanais, M. Celeste Artale
topic: We evaluate the redshift distribution of binary black hole (BBH), black hole - neutron star binary (BHNS) and binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, exploring the main sources of uncertainty: star formation rate (SFR) density, metallicity evolution, common envelope, mass transfer via Roche lobe overflow, natal kicks, core-collapse supernova model and initial mass function. Among binary evolution processes, uncertainties on common envelope ejection have a major impact: the local merger rate density of BNSs varies from sim10^3 to sim20 Gpc-3 yr-1 if we change the common envelope efficiency parameter from alphaCE=7 to 0.5, while the local merger rates of BBHs and BHNSs vary by a factor of sim2-3. The BBH merger rate changes by one order of magnitude, when 1sigma uncertainties on metallicity evolution are taken into account. In contrast, the BNS merger rate is almost insensitive to metallicity. Hence, BNSs are the ideal test bed to put constraints on uncertain binary evolution processes, such as common envelope and natal kicks. Our BNS models match the cosmic merger rate inferred from LIGO - Virgo data only for large values of alphaCE (greater 3) and only if the magnitude of natal kicks scales with the mass of the ejecta.

title: Structured, relativistic jets driven by radiation
authors: Eric R. Coughlin, Mitchell C. Begelman
topic: Relativistic jets, or highly collimated and fast-moving outflows, are endemic to many astrophysical phenomena. The jets produced by gamma-ray bursts and tidal disruption events are accompanied by the accretion of material onto a black hole or neutron star, with the accretion rate exceeding the Eddington limit of the compact object by orders of magnitude. In such systems, radiation dominates the energy-momentum budget of the outflow, and the dynamical evolution of the jet is governed by the equations of radiation hydrodynamics. Here we show that there are analytic solutions to the equations of radiation hydrodynamics in the viscous (i.e., diffusive) regime that describe structured, relativistic jets, which consist of a fast-moving, highly relativistic core surrounded by a slower-moving, less relativistic sheath. In these solutions, the slower-moving, outer sheath contains most of the mass, and the jet structure is mediated by local anisotropies in the radiation field. We show that, depending on the pressure and density profile of the ambient medium, the angular profile of the jet Lorentz factor is Gaussian or falls off even more steeply with angle. These solutions have implications for the nature of jet production and evolution in hyperaccreting systems, and demonstrate that such jets -- and the corresponding jet structure -- can be sustained entirely by radiative processes. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of jetted tidal disruption events and short and long gamma-ray bursts.

title: Viscous evolution of a massive disk surrounding stellar-mass black holes in full general relativity
authors: Sho Fujibayashi, Masaru Shibata, Shinya Wanajo, Kenta Kiuchi, Koutarou Kyutoku, Yuichiro Sekiguchi
topic: Long-term viscous neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations in full general relativity are performed for a massive disk surrounding spinning stellar-mass black holes with mass MBH=4, 6, and 10Msun and initial dimensionless spin χ=0.8. The initial disk is chosen to have mass Mdisk=0.1 or 3Msun as plausible models of the remnants for the merger of black hole-neutron star binaries or the stellar core collapse from a rapidly rotating progenitor, respectively. For Mdisk=0.1Msun with the outer disk edge initially located at rout similar 200 km, we find that 15%-20% of Mdisk is ejected and the average electron fraction of the ejecta is Ye=0.30-0.35 as found in the previous study. For Mdisk=3Msun, we find that =10%-20% of Mdisk is ejected for rout=200-1000 km. In addition, Ye of the ejecta can be enhanced to be greater then 0.4 because the electron fraction is increased significantly during the long-term viscous expansion of the disk with high neutrino luminosity until the mass ejection sets in. Our results suggest that not heavy r-process elements but light trans-iron elements would be synthesized in the matter ejected from a massive torus surrounding stellar-mass black holes. We also find that the outcomes of the viscous evolution for the high-mass disk case is composed of a rapidly spinning black hole surrounded by a torus with a narrow funnel, which appears to be suitable for generating gamma-ray bursts.

topic: With the black hole mass function (BHMF; assuming an exponential cutoff at a mass of 40Msun) of coalescing binary black hole systems constructed with the events detected in the O1 run of the advanced LIGO/Virgo network, Liang et al.(2017) predicted that the birth of the lightest intermediate mass black holes (LIMBHs; with a final mass of less 100Msun) is very likely to be caught by the advanced LIGO/Virgo detectors in their O3 run. The O1 and O2 observation run data, however, strongly favor a cutoff of the BHMF much sharper than the exponential one. In this work we show that a power-law function followed by a sudden drop at 40Msun by a factor of a few tens and then a new power-law component extending to less 100Msun are consistent with the O1 and O2 observation run data. With this new BHMF, quite a few LIMBH events can be detected in the O3 observation run of advanced LIGO/Virgo. The first LIMBH born in GW190521, an event detected in the early stage of the O3 run of advanced LIGO/Virgo network, provides additional motivation for our hypothesis.

topic: It is generally supposed that a transition from the normal decay phase (decay slope -1) to a steeper phase (decay slope -2) could be suggested as a jet break. The jet opening angle Theta jet is then calculated from the jet break time of the afterglow light curve. This allows the derivation of the collimation-corrected energy E jet of those GRBs. We extensively searched for the GRBs with jet break features from multi-wavelength afterglow light curves, and 138 GRBs with significant breaks were collected. The jet break times of those GRBs mainly range from 1000 s to 106 s, and the distribution of the collimation-corrected energy Ejet peaks at 10 to the power 50 erg.

topic: The search and follow-up observation of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of gravitational waves (GW) is a current hot topic of GW cosmology. Due to the limitation of the accuracy of the GW observation facility at this stage, we can only get a rough sky-localization region for the GW event, and the typical area of the region is between 200 and 1500 square degrees. Since GW events occur in or near galaxies, limiting the observation target to galaxies can significantly speedup searching for EM counterparts. Therefore, how to efficiently select host galaxy candidates in such a large GW localization region, how to arrange the observation sequence, and how to efficiently identify the GW source from observational data are the problems that need to be solved. International Virtual Observatory Alliance has developed a series of technical standards for data retrieval, interoperability and visualization. Based on the application of VO technologies, we construct the GW follow-up Observation Planning System (GWOPS).

title: Connections between Non-Rotating, Slowly Rotating, and Rapidly Rotating Turbulent Convection Transport Scalings
authors: Jonathan M. Aurnou, Susanne Horn, Keith Julien
topic: Buoyancy-driven convection is likely the dominant driver of turbulent motions in the universe, and thus, is widely studied by physicists, engineers, geophysicists and astrophysicists. Maybe unsurprisingly, these different communities discuss the gross convective behaviors in different ways, often without significant cross-talk existing between them. Here, we seek to draw connections between these communities. We do so by carrying out a set of basic scale estimations for how heat and fluid momentum transport should behave in non-rotating, slowly rotating and rapidly rotating buoyancy-driven convective environments. We find that slowly and rapidly rotating scalings can be inter-related via one parameter, the so-called convective Rossby number dissipation-free parameter measuring the importance of buoyancy driving relative to rotation. Further, we map between non-flux-based and the flux-based, buoyancy-driven scalings used by different groups. In doing so, these scalings show that there are clean connections between the different communities' approaches and that a number of the seemingly different scalings are actually synonymous with one another.

topic: Magnetized turbulence is ubiquitous in many astrophysical and terrestrial systems but no complete, uncontested theory even in the simplest form, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), exists. Many theories and phenomenologies focus on the joint (kinetic and magnetic) energy fluxes and spectra. We highlight the importance of treating kinetic and magnetic energies separately to shed light on MHD turbulence dynamics. We conduct an implicit large eddy simulation of subsonic, super-Alfvenic MHD turbulence and analyze the scale-wise energy transfer over time. Our key finding is that the kinetic energy spectrum develops a scaling in the stationary regime as the kinetic energy cascade is suppressed by magnetic tension. This motivates a reevaluation of existing MHD turbulence theories with respect to a more differentiated modeling of the energy fluxes.

title: Multi-Dimensional Solution of Fast Neutrino Conversions in Binary Neutron Star Merger Remnants
authors: Ian Padilla-Gay, Shashank Shalgar, Irene Tamborra 
topic: Fast pairwise conversions of neutrinos are predicted to be ubiquitous in neutron star merger remnants with potentially major implications on the nucleosynthesis of the elements heavier than iron. We present the first sophisticated numerical solution of the neutrino flavor evolution above the remnant disk within a (2+1+1) dimensional setup: two spatial coordinates, one angular variable, and time. We look for a steady-state flavor configuration above the remnant disk. Albeit the linear stability analysis predicts flavor instabilities at any location above the remnant disk, our simulations in the non-linear regime show that fast pairwise conversions lead to minimal neutrino mixing (less 1 percent) ; flavor equilibration is never achieved in our models. Importantly, fast neutrino conversions are more prominent within localized regions near the edges of the (anti)neutrino decoupling surfaces and almost negligible in the polar region of the remnant. Our findings on the role of fast pairwise conversions should be interpreted with caution because of the approximations intrinsic to our setup and advocate for further work within a more realistic framework.

title: Short duration gamma-ray bursts and their outflows in light of GW170817
authors: Davide Lazzati
topic: The detection of GW170817, it's extensive multi-wavelength follow-up campaign, and the large amount of theoretical development and interpretation that followed, have resulted in a significant step forward in the understanding of the binary neutron star merger phenomenon as a whole. One of its aspects is seeing the merger as a progenitor of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRB), which will be the subject of this review. On the one hand, GW170817 observations have confirmed some theoretical expectations, exemplified by the confirmation that binary neutron star mergers are the progenitors of SGRBs. In addition, the multimessenger nature of GW170817 has allowed for gathering of unprecedented data, such as the trigger time of the merger, the delay with which the gamma-ray photons were detected, and the brightening afterglow of an off-axis event. All together, the incomparable richness of the data from GW170817 has allowed us to paint a fairly detailed picture of at least one SGRB. I will detail what we learned, what new questions have arisen, and the perspectives for answering them when a sample of GW170817-comparable events have been studied.

title: The GW190521 Mass Gap Event and the Primordial Black Hole Scenario
authors: V. De Luca, V. Desjacques, G. Franciolini, P. Pani, A. Riotto
topic: The LIGO/Virgo Collaboration has recently observed GW190521, the first binary black hole merger with at least the primary component mass in the mass gap predicted by the pair-instability supernova theory. This observation disfavors the standard stellar-origin formation scenario for the heavier black hole, motivating alternative hypotheses. We show that GW190521 cannot be explained within the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) scenario if PBHs do not accrete during their cosmological evolution, since this would require an abundance which is already in tension with current constraints. On the other hand, GW190521 may have a primordial origin if PBHs accrete efficiently before the reionization epoch.

title: The influence of line opacity treatment in STELLA on supernova light curves
authors: Alexandra Kozyreva, Luke Shingles, Alexey Mironov, Petr Baklanov, Sergey Blinnikov
topic: We systematically explore the effect of the treatment of line opacity on supernova light curves. We find that it is important to consider line opacity for both scattering and absorption (i.e. thermalisation which mimics the effect of fluorescence.) We explore the impact of degree of thermalisation on three major types of supernovae: Type Ia, Type II-peculiar, and Type II-plateau. For that we use radiative transfer code STELLA and analyse broad-band light curves in the context of simulations done with the spectral synthesis code ARTIS and in the context a few examples of observed supernovae of each type. We found that the plausible range for the ratio between absorption and scattering in the radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA is (0.8-1):(0.2-0), i.e. the recommended thermalisation parameter is 0.9.

title: Convectively Driven Three Dimensional Turbulence in Massive Star Envelopes: I. A 1D Implementation of Diffusive Radiative Transport
authors: William Schultz, Lars Bildsten, Yan-Fei Jiang
topic: Massive (M>30Msun) stars exhibit luminosities that are near the Eddington-limit for electron scattering causing the increase in opacity associated with iron at T≈180,000K to trigger supersonic convection in their outer envelopes. Three dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations by Jiang and collaborators with the Athena++ computational tool have found order of magnitude density and radiative flux fluctuations in these convective regions, even at optical depths >> 100. We show here that radiation can diffuse out of a parcel during the timescale of convection in these optically thick parts of the star, motivating our use of a "pseudo" Mach number to characterize both the fluctuation amplitudes and their correlations. In this first paper, we derive the impact of these fluctuations on the radiative pressure gradient needed to carry a given radiative luminosity. This implementation leads to a remarkable improvement between 1D and 3D radiative pressure gradients, and builds confidence in our path to an eventual 1D implementation of these intrinsically 3D envelopes. However, simply reducing the radiation pressure gradient is not enough to implement a new 1D model.

title: The importance of charged particle reactions in the r-process on supernovae and neutron stars
authors: Pedro V. Guillaumon, Iuda D. Goldman
topic: We propose a (p,xn) mechanism with dynamic production as a new set of nuclear reactions that could produce high density neutrons and explain the r- and rp-elements. We calculate the rate of thorium and uranium produced by our proposed mechanism and show that it is compatible with different stellar conditions found in explosive events at an initial temperature of T geq 3*109K with a "freeze-out" by a neutrino-driven wind. We show that charged particle reactions could explain the discrepancies in the abundances of 232Th and 235,238U nucleochronometers. We extend the endpoint of the rapid proton (rp) process far beyond the previous work by showing that (p,xn) reactions could contribute to the nucleosynthesis of heavy stable neutron deficient nuclides. This implies in a broader definition of the rp-process and has important consequences for the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. We show that we did not need to assume an extreme condition for the drip line of super neutron-rich nuclei.

title: Properties and astrophysical implications of the 150 Msun binary black hole merger GW190521
authors: The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration
topic: The gravitational-wave signal GW190521 is consistent with a binary black hole merger source at redshift 0.8 with unusually high component masses, 85+21-14Msun and 66+17-18Msun, compared to previously reported events, and shows mild evidence for spin-induced orbital precession. The primary falls in the mass gap predicted by (pulsational) pair-instability supernova theory, in the approximate range 65−120Msun. The probability that at least one of the black holes in GW190521 is in that range is 99.0%. The final mass of the merger (142+28-16Msun) classifies it as an intermediate-mass black hole. Under the assumption of a quasi-circular binary black hole coalescence, we detail the physical properties of GW190521's source binary and its post-merger remnant, including component masses and spin vectors. Three different waveform models, as well as direct comparison to numerical solutions of general relativity, yield consistent estimates of these properties. Tests of strong-field general relativity targeting the merger-ringdown stages of coalescence indicate consistency of the observed signal with theoretical predictions. We estimate the merger rate. We discuss the astrophysical implications of GW190521 for stellar collapse, and for the possible formation of black holes in the pair-instability mass gap through various channels: via (multiple) stellar coalescence, or via hierarchical merger of lower-mass black holes in star clusters or in active galactic nuclei. We find it to be unlikely that GW190521 is a strongly lensed signal of a lower-mass black hole binary merger. We also discuss more exotic possible sources for GW190521, including a highly eccentric black hole binary, or a primordial black hole binary.

title: GW190814: Circumstantial Evidence for Up-Down Quark Star
authors: Zheng Cao, Lie-Wen Chen, Peng-Cheng Chu, Ying Zhou
topic: Within a confining quark matter model which considers phenomenologically the quark confinement and asymptotic freedom as well as the chiral symmetry restoration and quark deconfinement at high baryon density, we find that if the up-down quark matter (udQM) is more stable than nuclear matter and strange quark matter (SQM), the maximum mass of static quark stars with udQM is 2.77Msun under agreement with both the constraints on star tidal deformability from gravitational wave signal GW170817 and the mass-radius of PSR J0030+045 measured simultaneously by NICER. In contrast, the conventional strange quark star with SQM has a maximum static mass of only 2.05Msun and its radius significantly deviates from NICER's constraint. Our results thus provide circumstantial evidence suggesting the recently reported GW190814's secondary component with a mass of 2.59+0.08-0.09Msun could be an up-down quark star.

In this letter we propose several explanations based on models of new physics, including new light particle losses, modified gravity, large extra dimensions, and a small magnetic moment of the neutrino. Each of these affect the physics of the pair-instability differently, leading to novel mechanisms for forming black holes inside the black hole mass gap.

authors: Virginia Cunningham, S. Bradley Cenko, Geoffrey Ryan, Stuart N. Vogel, Alessandra Corsi, Antonino Cucchiara, Andrew S. Fruchter, Assaf Horesh, Tuomas Kangas, Daniel Kocevski, Daniel A. Perley, Judith Racusin
topic: We present multiwavelength modeling of the afterglow from the long gamma-ray burst GRB 160625B using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques of the afterglowpy Python package. GRB 160625B is an extremely bright burst with a rich set of observations spanning from radio to gamma-ray frequencies. These observations range from ~0.1 days to >1000 days, thus making this event extremely well-suited to such modeling. In this work we compare top-hat and Gaussian jet structure types in order to find best fit values for the GRB jet collimation angle, viewing angle, and other physical parameters. We find that a Gaussian-shaped jet is preferred (2.7-5.3 sigma) over the traditional top-hat model. Our estimate for the opening angle of the burst ranges from 1.26 to 3.90 degrees, depending on jet shape model. We also discuss the implications that assumptions on jet shape, viewing angle, and particularly the participation fraction of electrons have on the final estimation of GRB intrinsic energy release and the resulting energy budget of the relativistic outflow.

title: Combining Electromagnetic and Gravitational-Wave Constraints on Neutron-Star Masses and Radii
authors: Mohammad Al-Mamun, Andrew W. Steiner, Joonas Nattila, Jacob Lange, Richard O'Shaugnessy, Ingo Tews, Stefano Gandolfi, Craig Heinke, Sophia Han
topic: We perform a joint Bayesian inference of neutron-star mass and radius constraints based on GW170817, observations of quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries (QLMXBs), photospheric radius expansion X-ray bursts (PREs), and X-ray timing observations of J0030+0451. With this data set, the form of the prior distribution still has an impact on the posterior mass-radius (MR) curves and equation of state (EOS), but this impact is smaller than recently obtained when considering QLMXBs alone. We analyze the consistency of the electromagnetic data by including an "intrinsic scattering" contribution to the uncertainties, and find only a slight broadening of the posteriors. This suggests that the gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations of neutron-star structure are providing a consistent picture of the neutron-star mass-radius curve and the EOS.

title: GRB 200415A: magnetar giant flare or short gamma-ray burst?
authors: Pavel Minaev, Alexei Pozanenko
topic: A detailed analysis of the GBM/Fermi experiment data is carried out to classify GRB 200415A. It is shown that, on the one hand, this event exhibits typical for type I (short) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) properties, such as duration, variability, and the character of spectral evolution (lag). On the other hand, the localization of the event source on the celestial plane, obtained by the triangulation method (IPN), indicates the nearby (DL = 3.5 Mpc) galaxy NGC 253 (Sculptor) as a possible host galaxy for this burst. It introduces significant restrictions on the energetics of the event (Eiso ~ 1046 erg) and gives an alternative interpretation of GRB 200415A as a giant flare (GF) of a soft gamma repeater (SGR). This interpretation is supported by the atypically hard energy spectrum.

topic: The mergers of two neutron stars are typically accompanied by broad-band electromagnetic emission from either a relativistic jet or a kilonova. It has also been long predicted that coherent radio emission will occur during the merger phase or from a newly formed neutron star remnant, however this emission has not been seen to date. This paper presents the deepest limits for this emission from a neutron star merger folowing triggered LOFAR observations of the short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) 181123B, starting 4.4 minutes after the GRB occurred. During the X-ray plateau phase, a signature of ongoing energy injection, we detect no radio emission to a 3σ limit of 153 mJy at 144 MHz, which is significantly fainter to the predicted emission from a standard neutron star. Snapshot images were made of the radio observation on a range of timescales, targeting short duration radio flashes similar to fast radio bursts (FRBs). No emission was detected in the snapshot images at the location of GRB 181123B enabling constraints to be placed on the prompt coherent radio emission model and emission predicted to occur when a neutron star collapses to form a black hole.

title: Lense-Thirring Precession of Misaligned Discs I
authors: Sergei Dyda, Christopher S. Reynolds
topic: We study Lense-Thirring precession of inviscid and viscous misaligned alpha-discs around a black hole using a gravitomagnetic term in the momentum equation. For weak misalignments, i \leq 10~deg, the discs behave like rigid bodies, undergoing the full suite of classical harmonic oscillator dynamics including, weak and critically damped motion (due to viscosity), precession (due to Lense-Thirring torque) and nutation (due to apsidal precession). For strong misalignments, i \geq 30~deg, we find sufficiently thin, h/r \leq 0.05 discs break, form a gap and the inner and outer sub-discs evolve quasi independently apart from slow mass transfer. Assuming the sound speed sets the communication speed of warps in the disc, we can estimate the breaking radius by requiring that the inner sub-disc precesses like a rigid body. We explicitly show for the first time using a grid code that an Einstein potential is needed to reproduce the analytic properties of the inner disc edge and find disc breaking. At large inclination angles we find multiple disc breaks, consistent with recent GRMHD simulations of highly inclined discs. Our results suggest that the inclusion of a gravitomagnetic term and appropriate pseudo-Newtonian potential captures the important quantitative features of misaligned discs.

title: Neutrino Counterparts of Fast Radio Bursts
authors: Brian D. Metzger, Ke Fang, Ben Maraglit
topic: The discovery of a luminous radio burst, FRB 200428, with properties similar to those of fast radio bursts (FRB), in coincidence with an X-ray flare from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, supports magnetar models for cosmological FRBs. The burst's X-ray to radio fluence ratio, as well as the X-ray spectral shape and peak energy, are consistent with FRB 200428 being the result of an ultra-relativistic shock (powered, e.g., by an ejected plasmoid) propagating into a magnetized baryon-rich external medium; the shock simultaneously generates X-ray/gamma-rays via thermal synchrotron emission from electrons heated behind the shock, and coherent radio emission via the synchrotron maser mechanism. Here, we point out that a unique consequence of this baryon-loaded shock scenario is the generation of a coincident burst of high-energy neutrinos, generated by photo-hadronic interaction of relativistic ions - heated or accelerated at the shock - with thermal synchrotron photons. We estimate the properties of these neutrino burst FRB counterparts and find that a fraction ~1e-8-1e-5 of the flare energy (or ~1e-4-0.1 of the radio isotropic energy) is channeled into production of neutrinos with typical energies ~ TeV-PeV. We conclude by discussing prospects for detecting this signal with IceCube and future high-energy neutrino detectors.

title: Kinetic Simulations of Cosmic-Ray-Modified Shocks I: Hydrodynamics
authors: Colby C. Haggerty, Damiano Caprioli
topic: Collisionless plasma shocks are efficient sources of non-thermal particle acceleration in space and astrophysical systems. We use hybrid (kinetic ions -- fluid electrons) simulations to examine the non-linear feedback of the self-generated energetic particles (cosmic rays, CRs) on the shock hydrodynamics. When CR acceleration is efficient, we find evidence of both an upstream precursor, where the inflowing plasma is compressed and heated, and a downstream postcursor, where the energy flux in CRs and amplified magnetic fields play a dynamical role. For the first time, we assess how non-linear magnetic fluctuations in the postcursor preferentially travel away from the shock at roughly the local Alfvén speed with respect to the downstream plasma. The drift of both magnetic and CR energy with respect to the thermal plasma substantially increases the shock compression ratio with respect to the standard prediction, in particular exceeding 4 for strong shocks. Such modifications also have implications for the spectrum of the particles accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration, a significant result detailed in a companion paper.

authors: Hanindyo Kuncarayakti, Gaston Folatelli, Keiichi Maeda, Luc Dessart, Anders Jerkstrand, Joseph P. Anderson, Kentaro Aoki, Melina C. Bersten, Lucia Ferrari, et al
topic: The narrow component appears also in other lines, and is conspicuous in [O I]. This indicates the presence of multiple distinct kinematic components of material at low and high velocities. The low-velocity components are likely to be produced by a dense, slow-moving emitting region near the center, while the broad components are emitted over a larger volume. These observations suggest an asymmetric explosion, supporting the idea of two-component ejecta that influence the resulting late-time spectra and light curves. SN 2016gkg thus presents striking evidence for significant asymmetry in a standard-energy SN explosion. The presence of material at low velocity, which is not predicted in 1D simulations, emphasizes the importance of multi-dimensional explosion modeling of SNe.

title: Curvature-slope correlation of nuclear symmetry energy and its imprints on the crust-core transition, radius and tidal deformability of canonical neutron stars
authors: Bao-An Li, Macon Magno
topic: Background: Nuclear symmetry energy Esym(ρ) encoding information about the energy necessary to make nuclear systems more neutron-rich is poorly known especially at supra-saturation densities but has broad impacts on properties of neutron stars. While its slope parameter L at the saturation density ρ0 of nuclear matter has been relatively well constrained by recent astrophysical observations and terrestrial nuclear experiments, its curvature Ksym characterizing the Esym(ρ) around 2ρ0 remains largely unconstrained. Over 520 calculations for Esym(ρ) using various nuclear theories and interactions in the literature have predicted several significantly different Ksym−L correlations. Purpose: If a unique Ksym−L correlation of Esym(ρ) can be firmly established, it will enable us to progressively better constrain the high-density behavior of Esym(ρ) using the available constraints on its slope parameter L. We investigate if and by how much the different Ksym−L correlations may affect neutron star observables. Method: A meta-model of nuclear Equation of States (EOSs) with three representative Ksym−L correlation functions is used to generate multiple EOSs for neutron stars.

title: Finding quark content of neutron stars in light of GW170817
authors: Rana Nandi, Subrata Pal
topic: The detection of gravitational waves from GW170817 has provided a new opportunity to constrain the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars. In this article, we investigate the possible existence of quarks inside the neutron star core in the context of GW170817. The nucleon phase is treated within the relativistic nuclear mean-field approach where we have employed a fully comprehensive set of available models, and the quark phase is described in the Bag model. We show that the nucleonic EOSs which are inconsistent with the tidal deformability bound become consistent when phase transition to quark matter via Gibbs construction is allowed. We find that several nucleonic EOSs support the presence of pure quark matter core with a small mass not more than 0.17Msun confined within a radius of 0.9 km. We also find that the strong correlation between tidal deformability and neutron star radii observed for pure nucleonic stars does persist even with a nucleon-quark phase transition and provides an upper limit on the radius of R1.4 less or eq 12.9 km for a 1.4Msun neutron star.

title: Polarization of GRB Prompt Emission and its Application to POLAR's Data
authors: Mi-Xiang Lan, Xue-Feng Wu, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: Synchrotron emission polarization is very sensitive to the magnetic field configuration. Recently, polarization of synchrotron emission with a mixed (SM) magnetic field in Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow phase had been developed. Here, we apply these SM models to GRB prompt phase and compare their polarization properties with that of synchrotron emission in purely ordered (SO) magnetic field. We find that the polarization properties in a SM model are very similar to these in a corresponding SO model (e.g., synchrotron emission in a mixed magnetic field with an aligned ordered part (SMA) and synchrotron emission with a purely ordered aligned magnetic field (SOA)), only with a lower polarization degree (PD). We also discuss the statistical properties of the models. We find PDs of the simulated bursts are concentrated around 25percent for both SOA and synchrotron emission in a purely ordered toroidal magnetic field (SOT), while they can range from 0percent to 25percent for SMA and synchrotron emission in a mixed magnetic field with a toroidal ordered part (SMT), depending on Xi_B value, i.e., the ratio of magnetic reduction of the ordered magnetic field over that of random magnetic field. From statistics, if PDs of majority GRBs are non-zero, then it favours SO and SM models.

title: GRB Spectrum from Gradual Dissipation in a Magnetized Outflow
authors: Ramandeep Gill, Jonathan Granot, Paz Beniamini
topic: Modeling of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission spectra sometimes requires a (quasi-) thermal spectral component in addition to the Band function. In photospheric emission models, a prominent thermal component broadened by sub-photospheric dissipation is expected to be released at the photospheric radius, rph∼10^12cm. We consider an ultra-relativistic strongly magnetized outflow with a striped-wind magnetic-field structure undergoing gradual and continuous magnetic energy dissipation at R less Rs that heats and accelerates the flow, leading to a bulk Lorentz factor where typically Rph less Rs. Similar dynamics and energy dissipation rates are also expected in highly-variable magnetized outflows without stripes/field-reversals. Two modes of particle energy injection are considered: (a) power-law electrons, e.g. accelerated by magnetic reconnection, and (b) continuous distributed heating of all electrons (and e±-pairs), e.g. due to MHD instabilities. Time-resolved energy spectra are obtained using a numerical code that evolves coupled kinetic equations for a photon-electron-positron plasma. We find that (i) the thermal component peaks at.

title: Impact of the ISM magnetic field on GRB afterglow polarization
authors: O. Teboul, N. Shaviv
topic: Linear polarization has been measured in several GRB afterglows. After a few days, polarization arises from the forward shock emission which depends on the post-shock magnetic field. The latter can originate both from compression of existing fields, here the ISM magnetic field, and from shock generated instabilities. For short GRBs, previous modelling of the polarization arising from the forward shock considered a random field fully or partially confined to the shock plane. However, the ISM magnetic field likely consists of both random and ordered components. Here we study the impact of a more realistic magnetic field having both ordered and random components. We present our semi-analytical model and compute polarization curves arising for different magnetic field configurations. We find that the presence of an ordered component, even significantly weaker than the random one, has distinct signatures that could be detectable. In the presence of an ordered component not in the observer plane, we show that: i) for an observer inside the jet, the polarization angle, either remains constant during all the afterglow phase or exhibits variations smaller than the 90degrees swing expected from a random component solely, ii) for an observer outside the jet, the polarization angle evolves from.

authors: Marco Limongi, Alessandro Chieffi
topic: We present the last version of {\scshape{Hyperion}} (HYdrodynamic Ppm Explosion with Radiation diffusION), a hydrodynamic code designed to calculate the explosive nucleosynthesis, remnant mass and light curve associated to the explosion of a massive star. By means of this code we compute the explosion of a subset of red supergiant models, taken from the database published by \cite{lc18}, for various explosion energies in the range ~0.20−2.00 1051 erg. The main outcomes of these simulations, i.e., remnant mass, 56Ni synthesized, luminosity and length of the plateau of the bolometric light curve, are analyzed as a function of the initial parameters of the star (mass and metallicity) and of the explosion energy. As a first application of {\scshape{Hyperion}} we estimated the mass and the metallicity of the progenitor star of SN 1999em, a well studied SN IIP, by means of the light curve fitting.

title: The Synchrotron Polarization in Decaying Magnetic Field in Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: K.F. Cheng, X.H. Zhao, J.M. Bai
topic: Polarization can serve as a probe of the radiation mechanism and magnetic field (MF) configuration in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In the case of constant MF, the synchrotron polarization in the prompt phase of GRBs has been widely studied. In this paper, we consider the case of the decaying MF. We calculate the time-averaged and instantaneous synchrotron polarizations in a pulse for different viewing angles and for the large-scale decaying MF model, which can explain the so-called Band spectrum. We find that the on-axis time-averaged polarization degree (PD) in the energy band of 50-500 keV for the decaying large-scale MF model (~0.6 for typical parameters) is higher than that in the constant MF model (~0.5). An interesting result is the instantaneous PD in the off-axis case will experience a turnover, i.e., the PD will evolve from a positive value to a negative one. This suggests the polarization angle (PA) change by an angle of 90[deg]. Such a result is roughly consistent with the discovery of the PA evolution within a pulse in some bursts, such as GRB 170114A and GRB 160821A. Our result implies at least a part of bursts (off-axis bursts) should have the PA evolution in a pulse.

authors: W. Fong (Northwestern/CIERA), T. Laskar, J. Rastinejad, A. Rouco Escorial, G. Schroeder, J. Barnes, C. D. Kilpatrick, K. Paterson, E. Berger, B. D. Metzger, et al
topic: We present the discovery of the radio afterglow and near-infrared (NIR) counterpart of the Swift short GRB 200522A, located at a small projected offset of ≈1 kpc from the center of a young, star-forming host galaxy at z=0.5536. The radio and X-ray luminosities of the afterglow are consistent with those of on-axis cosmological short GRBs. The NIR counterpart, revealed by our HST observations at a rest-frame time of approx 2.3 days, has a luminosity of sim (1.3−1.7) times 10 to the power of 42 erg s−1. This is substantially lower than on-axis short GRB afterglow detections, but is a factor of ≈8-17 more luminous than the kilonova of GW170817, and significantly more luminous than any kilonova candidate for which comparable observations exist. The combination of the counterpart's color (i−y=-0.08 pm 0.21; rest-frame) and luminosity cannot be explained by standard radioactive heating alone. We present two scenarios to interpret the broad-band behavior of GRB 200522A: a synchrotron forward shock with a luminous kilonova (potentially boosted by magnetar energy deposition), or forward and reverse shocks from alpha approx 14deg, relativistic (Gamma0 greater 80) jet. Models which include a combination of enhanced radioactive heating rates, low-lanthanide mass fractions, or additional sources of heating from late-time central engine activity may provide viable alternate explanations.

title: Monte-Carlo neutrino transport in neutron star merger simulations
authors: Francois Foucart, Matthew D. Duez, Francois Hebert, Lawrence E. Kidder, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel
topic: Gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals from merging neutron star binaries provide valuable information about the the properties of dense matter, the formation of heavy elements, and high-energy astrophysics. To fully leverage observations of these systems, we need numerical simulations that provide reliable predictions for the properties of the matter unbound in these mergers. An important limitation of current simulations is the use of approximate methods for neutrino transport that do not converge to a solution of the transport equations as numerical resolution increases, and thus have errors that are impossible to quantify. Here, we report on a first simulation of a binary neutron star merger that directly solves the transport equations using Monte-Carlo techniques. We demonstrate that a computationally cheap Monte-Carlo transport can be implemented without ill effects from sampling noise. We apply Monte-Carlo transport to an unequal mass neutron star binary merger up to 5ms past merger, and report on the properties of the matter and neutrino outflows. Finally, we compare our results to the output of our best approximate `M1' transport scheme, demonstrating that an M1 scheme that carefully approximates the neutrino energy spectrum only leads to ~10\% uncertainty in the composition and velocity of the ejecta

title: Returning radiation in strong gravity around black holes: Reverberation from the accretion disc
authors: D.R. Wilkins, J.A. García, T. Dauser, A.C. Fabian
topic: We study reflected X-ray emission that returns to the accretion disc in the strong gravitational fields around black holes using General Relativistic ray tracing and radiative transfer calculations. Reflected X-rays that are produced when the inner regions of the disc are illuminated by the corona are subject to strong gravitational light bending, causing up to 47 per cent of the reflected emission to be returned to the disc around a rapidly spinning black hole, depending upon the scale height of the corona. The iron K line is enhanced relative to the continuum by 25 per cent, and the Compton hump by up to a factor of three. Additional light travel time between primary and secondary reflections increases the reverberation time lag measured in the iron K band by 49 per cent, while the soft X-ray lag is increased by 25 per cent and the Compton hump response time is increased by 60 per cent. Measured samples of X-ray reverberation lags are shown to be consistent with X-rays returning to the accretion disc in strong gravity. Understanding the effects of returning radiation is important in interpreting reverberation observations to probe black holes. Reflected X-rays returning to the disc can be uniquely identified by blueshifted returning iron K line photons that are Compton scattered from the inner disc, producing excess, delayed emission in the 3.5-4.5keV energy range that will be detectable with forthcoming X-ray observatories, representing a unique test of General Relativity in the strong field limit.

title: Accretion discs with non-zero central torque
authors: C. J. Nixon, J. E. Pringle
topic: We present analytical and numerical solutions for accretion discs subject to a non-zero central torque. We express this in terms of a single parameter, f, which is the ratio of outward viscous flux of angular momentum from the inner boundary to the inward advected flux of angular momentum there. The standard "accretion" disc, where the central boundary condition is zero-torque, is represented by f=0. A "decretion" disc, where the radial velocity at the inner boundary is zero, is represented by f goes to infinity. For f greater then 0 a torque is applied to the disc at the inner boundary, which feeds both angular momentum and energy into the disc. This can arise, for example, in the case of a circumbinary disc where resonances transfer energy and angular momentum from the binary to the disc orbits, or where the disc is around a rotating magnetic star which can allow the disc orbits to be accelerated outwards at the magnetospheric radius. We present steady-state solutions to the disc structure as a function of f, and for arbitrary kinematic viscosity ν.

title: Identifying black hole central engines in gamma-ray bursts
authors: Vidushi Sharma, Shabnam Iyyani, Dipankar Bhattacharya
topic: The nature of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engine still remains an enigma. Entities widely believed to be capable of powering the extreme jets are magnetars and black holes. The maximum rotational energy that is available in a millisecond magnetar to form a jet is ~10^52 erg. We identify 8 long GRBs whose jet opening angle corrected energetics of the prompt emission episode are >10^52 erg with high confidence level and therefore, their central engines are expected to be black holes. Majority of these GRBs present significant emission in sub-GeV energy range. The X-ray afterglow light curves of these bursts do not show any shallow decay behaviour such as a plateau, however, a few cases exhibit flares and multiple breaks instead of a single power-law decay. For a minimum mass of the black hole (~2 Msun), we find the efficiency of producing a jet from its rotational energy to range between 2\%-270\%. Highly energetic jets requiring high efficiencies implies that either the mass of these black holes are much larger or there are, in addition, other sources of energy which power the jet. By considering the Blandford-Znajek mechanism of jet formation, we estimate the masses of these black holes to range between ~2-60 Msun.

title: Measuring the Hubble Constant with a sample of kilonovae
authors: Michael W. Coughlin, Sarah Antier, Tim Dietrich, Ryan J. Foley, Jack Heinzel, Mattia Bulla, Nelson Christensen, David A. Coulter, Lina Issa, Nandita Khetan
topic: Kilonovae produced by the coalescence of compact binaries with at least one neutron star are promising standard sirens for an independent measurement of the Hubble constant (H0). Through their detection via follow-up of gravitational-wave (GW), short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) or optical surveys, a large sample of kilonovae (even without GW data) can be used for H0 contraints. Here, we show measurement of H0 using light curves associated with four sGRBs, assuming these are attributable to kilonovae, combined with GW170817. Including a systematic uncertainty on the models that is as large as the statistical ones, we find H0=73.8+6.3−5.8\,km s−1 Mpc−1 and H0=71.2+3.2−3.1\,km s−1 Mpc−1 for two different kilonova models that are consistent with the local and inverse-distance ladder measurements. For a given model, this measurement is about a factor of 2-3 more precise than the standard-siren measurement for GW170817 using only GWs.

title: Magnetorotational core collapse of possible GRB progenitors. III. Three-dimensional models
authors: Martin Obergaulinger (1 and 2), Miguel-Ángel Aloy
topic: We explore the influence of non-axisymmetric modes on the dynamics of the collapsed core of rotating, magnetised high-mass stars in three-dimensional simulations of a rapidly rotating star with an initial mass of MZAMS=35Msun endowed with four different pre-collapse configurations of the magnetic field, ranging from moderate to very strong field strength and including the field predicted by the stellar evolution model. The model with the weakest magnetic field achieves shock revival due to neutrino heating in a gain layer characterised by a large-scale, hydrodynamic m=1 spiral mode. Later on, the growing magnetic field of the proto neutron star launches weak outflows into the early ejecta. Their orientation follows the evolution of the rotational axis of the proto neutron star, which starts to tilt from the original orientation due to the asymmetric accretion flows impinging on its surface. The models with stronger magnetisation generate mildly relativistic, magnetically driven polar outflows propagating over a distance of 104 km within a few 100 ms. These jets are stabilised against disruptive non-axisymmetric instabilities by their fast propagation and by the shear of their toroidal magnetic field. Within the simulation times of around 1 s, the explosions reach moderate energies and the growth of the proto neutron star masses ceases at values substantially below the threshold for black hole formation, which, in combination with the high rotational energies, might suggest a possible later proto-magnetar activity.

title: Short gamma-ray bursts and the decompression of neutron star matter in tidal streams
authors: C. J. Nixon, E. R. Coughlin, J. E. Pringle
topic: Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) are generally thought to result from the merger of two neutron stars or the merger of a neutron star with a black hole. It is becoming standard practise to model these mergers with hydrodynamical simulations that employ equations of state that are derived, for example, for determining the behaviour of matter in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), and which therefore make use of the assumption that the matter is hot and in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). In this Letter we draw attention to the fact that the hydrodynamical timescale (roughly the gravitational timescale of the neutron star) may be several orders of magnitude shorter than the timescale on which such equilibrium can be re-established in the tidal debris ejected during a sGRB, and that on the initial decompression timescales the unshocked tidal ejecta may remain sufficiently cool that the employed equations of state are not appropriate for modelling the dynamics of this part of the flow. On timescales short compared with the timescale on which NSE can be (re)established, the equation of state can remain relatively stiff and thus the stream of tidal debris can remain narrow and vulnerable to gravitational instability, as has recently been suggested. These findings suggest that estimates of the type and abundances of heavy elements formed in short gamma-ray bursts need to be revisited. We suggest that the most direct method of testing the physical and dynamical properties of tidal ejecta in sGRBs will come from modelling of their light curves, which provides the cleanest source of information on the system dynamics.

title: Delta baryons and diquark formation in the cores of neutron stars
authors: German Malfatti, Milva G. Orsaria, Ignacio F. Ranea-Sandoval, Gustavo A. Contrera, Fridolin Weber
topic: We investigate the hadron-quark phase transition in cold neutron stars in light of (i) the observed limits on the maximum-mass of heavy pulsars, (ii) constraints on the tidal properties inferred from the gravitational waves emitted in binary neutron-star mergers, and (iii) mass and radius constraints derived from the observation of hot spots on neutron star observed with NICER. Special attention is directed to the possible presence of Delta(1232) baryons in neutron star matter. Our results indicate that this particle could make up a large fraction of the baryons in neutron stars and thus have a significant effect on the properties of such objects, particularly on their radii. This is partially caused by the low density appearance of Δs for a wide range of theoretically defensible sets of meson-hyperon, SU(3) ESC08 model, and meson-Delta coupling constants. The transition of hadronic matter to quark matter, treated in the 2SC+s condensation phase, is found to occur only in neutron stars very close to the mass peak.

authors: Daniel M. Siegel
topic: The gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo together with their electromagnetic partner facilities have transformed the modus operandi in which we seek information about the Universe. The first ever-observed neutron-star merger---GW170817---confirmed the association of short gamma-ray bursts with neutron-star mergers and the production of heavy (r-process) elements. Based on recent theoretical and observational developments, I briefly present and discuss a conjecture, namely that compact accretion disks in both short and long gamma-ray bursts synthesize most of the heavy r-process elements in the Universe. The upcoming era of multi-messenger astronomy may allow us to verify or falsify this conjecture.

title: Interpreting the X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts
with radiative losses and millisecond magnetars
authors: Nikhil Sarin, Paul D. Lasky, Gregory Ashton
topic: The spin-down energy of millisecond magnetars has been invoked to explain X-ray afterglow observations of a significant fraction of short and long gamma-ray bursts. Here, we extend models previously introduced in the literature, incorporating radiative losses with the spin down of a magnetar central engine through an arbitrary braking index. Combining this with a model for the tail of the prompt emission, we show that our model can better explain the data than millisecond-magnetar models without radiative losses or those that invoke spin down solely through vacuum dipole radiation. We find that our model predicts a subset of X-ray flares seen in some gamma-ray bursts. We can further explain the diversity of X-ray plateaus by altering the radiative efficiency and measure the braking index of newly-born millisecond magnetars. We measure the braking index of GRB061121 as n=4.85+0.11-0.15 suggesting the millisecond-magnetar born in this gamma-ray burst spins down predominantly through gravitational-wave emission.

title: A scalable random forest regressor for combining neutron-star equation of state measurements: A case study with GW170817 and GW190425
authors: Francisco Hernandez Vivanco, Rory Smith, Eric Thrane, Paul D. Lasky
topic: Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star coalescences constrain the neutron-star equation of state by enabling measurement of the tidal deformation of each neutron star. This deformation is determined by the tidal deformability parameter Λ, which was constrained using the first binary neutron star gravitational-wave observation, GW170817. Now, with the measurement of the second binary neutron star, GW190425, we can combine different gravitational-wave measurements to obtain tighter constraints on the neutron-star equation of state. In this paper, we combine data from GW170817 and GW190425 to place constraints on the neutron-star equation of state. To facilitate this calculation, we derive interpolated marginalized likelihoods for each event using a machine learning algorithm. These likelihoods, which we make publicly available, allow for results from multiple gravitational-wave signals to be easily combined.

title: The surface of rapidly-rotating neutron stars: implications to neutron star parameter estimation
authors: Hector O. Silva, George Pappas, Nicolás Yunes, Kent Yagi
topic: The Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) is currently observing the x-ray pulse profiles emitted by hot spots on the surface of rotating neutron stars allowing for an inference of their radii with unprecedented precision. A critical ingredient in the pulse profile model is an analytical formula for the oblate shape of the star. These formulas require a fitting over a large ensemble of neutron star solutions, which cover a wide set of equations of state, stellar compactnesses and rotational frequencies. However, this procedure introduces a source of systematic error, as (i) the fits do not describe perfectly the surface of all stars in the ensemble and (ii) neutron stars are described by a single equation of state, whose influence on the surface shape is averaged out during the fitting procedure. Here we perform a first study of this systematic error, finding evidence that it is subdominant relative to the statistical error in the radius inference by NICER. We also find evidence that the formula currently used by NICER can be used in the inference of the radii of rapidly rotating stars, outside of the formula's domain of validity. Moreover, we employ an accurate enthalpy-based method to locate the surface of numerical solutions of rapidly rotating neutron stars and a new highly-accurate formula to describe their surfaces.

title: Simulations of early kilonova emission from neutron star mergers
authors: Smaranika Banerjee, Masaomi Tanaka, Kyohei Kawaguchi, Daiji Kato, Gediminas Gaigalas
topic: We present radiative transfer simulations for blue kilonovae hours after neutron star (NS) mergers by performing detailed opacity calculations for the first time. We calculate atomic structures and opacities of highly ionized elements (up to the tenth ionization) with atomic number Z = 20 - 56. We find that the bound-bound transitions of heavy elements are the dominant source of the opacities in the early phase (t less 1 day after the merger), and that the ions with a half-closed electron shell provide the highest contributions. The Planck mean opacity for lanthanide-free ejecta (with electron fraction of Ye = 0.30 - 0.40) can only reach around kappa similar 0.5 - 1 cm^2 g^-1 at t = 0.1 day, whereas that increases up to kappa ~ 5 - 10 cm^2 g^-1 at t = 1 day. The spherical ejecta model with an ejecta mass of Mej = 0.05Msun gives the bolometric luminosity of similar 2 x 10^42 erg s^-1 at t similar to 0.1 day. We confirm that the existing bolometric and multi-color data of GW170817 can be naturally explained by the purely radioactive model.

authors: C. Grandorf, J. McCarty, P. Rajkumar, H. Harbin, K.H. Lee, A. Corsi, I. Bartos, Z. Marka, A. Balasubramanian, S. Marka
topic: The multi-messenger discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) and light from the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817, associated with Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 170817A and kilonova AT2017gfo, has marked the start of a new era in astrophysics. GW170817 has confirmed that binary NS mergers are progenitors of at least some short GRBs. The peculiar properties of the GRB 170817A radio afterglow, characterized by a delayed onset related to the off-axis geometry, have also demonstrated how some nearby short GRBs may not be identified as such with standard short-timescale electromagnetic follow-up observations. Building upon this new information, we performed late-time radio observations of a sample of four short GRBs with unknown redshift and no previously detected afterglow in the \textit{Swift}/BAT sample in order to identify nearby (dL less 200 Mpc) off-axis GRB candidates via their potential late-time radio signatures. We find a previously uncatalogued radio source within the error region of GRB 130626 with a 3-6 GHz flux density consistent with a NS radio flare at a distance of approx 100 Mpc. However, an origin related to a persistent radio source unrelated to the GRB cannot be excluded given the high chance of false positives in error regions as large as those considered here. Further radio follow-up observations are needed to better understand the origin of this source.

title: Magnetar giant flare origin for GRB 200415A inferred from a new scaling relation
authors: Hai-Ming Zhang, Ruo-Yu Liu, Shu-Qing Zhong, Xiang-Yu Wang
topic: Soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) are mainly a Galactic population and originate from neutron stars with intense (B sim 10 power of 15 G) magnetic fields (magnetars). Occasionally (once every 30−40\,yr), a giant flare occurs with enormous intensity, displaying a short hard spike, followed by a weaker, oscillatory phase which exhibits the period of the neutron star. If the magnetar giant flares occur in nearby galaxies, they would appear as cosmic short-hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) without detecting the weak oscillatory phase. Recently, a short-hard GRB named GRB 200415A was detected, with a position coincident with the Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), rasing the question whether it is a classic short GRB or a magentar giant flare. Here we show that magnetar giant flares follow a scaling relation between the spectral peak energy and the isotropic energy in. The relation can be well understood in the model that giant flares arise from the photosphere emissions of relativistically expanding fireball. GRB 200415A, together with two other candidate giant flares (GRB 051103 and GRB 070201) follow this relation, which strongly favor the giant flare origin of these GRBs. The GeV emission detected by \emph{Fermi}/LAT from GRB 200415A at 18−285s can also be explained in the giant flare scenario

title: A comparison of momentum transport models for numerical relativity
authors: Matthew D. Duez, Alexander Knight, Francois Foucart, Milad Haddadi, Jerred Jesse, Francois Hebert, Lawrence E. Kidder, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel
topic: The main problems of nonvacuum numerical relativity, compact binary mergers and stellar collapse, involve hydromagnetic instabilities and turbulent flows, so that kinetic energy at small scales have mean effects at large scale that drive the secular evolution. Notable among these effects is momentum transport. We investigate two models of this transport effect, a relativistic Navier-Stokes system and a turbulent mean stress model, that are similar to all of the prescriptions that have been attempted to date for treating subgrid effects on binary neutron star mergers and their aftermath. Our investigation involves both stability analysis and numerical experimentation on star and disk systems. We also begin the investigation of the effects of particle and heat transport on post-merger simulations. We find that correct handling of turbulent heating can be important for avoiding unphysical instabilities. Given such appropriate handling, the evolution of a differentially rotating star and the accretion rate of a disk are reassuringly insensitive to the choice of prescription. However, disk outflows can be sensitive to the choice of method, even for the same effective viscous strength. We also consider the effects of eddy diffusion in the evolution of an accretion disk and show that it can interestingly affect the composition of outflows.

topic: Multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of Low Mass X-ray Binaries in the hard state are determined by the emission from a jet, for frequencies up to mid-infrared, and emission from the accretion flow in the optical to X-ray range. In the last years, the flat radio-to-mid-IR spectra of Black Hole (BH) X-ray binaries was described using the internal shocks model, which assumes that the fluctuations in the velocity of the ejecta along the jet are driven by the fluctuations in the accretion flow, described by the X-ray Power Density Spectrum (PDS). In this work we attempt to apply this model for the first time to a Neutron Star (NS) LMXB, i.e. 4U 0614+091. We used the multi-wavelength data set obtained in 2006, comprising data from radio to X-ray, and applied a model which includes an irradiated disc model for the accretion flow and an updated version of the internal shocks code for the ejection. The new version of the code allows to change the geometry of the jet for the case of non-conical jets.

title: Analytic properties of electromagnetic field of binary compact stars and electromagnetic precursors to gravitational waves
authors: Tomoki Wada, Masaru Shibata, Kunihito Ioka
topic: We analytically study the properties of the electromagnetic field in vacuum around close binary compact stars containing at least one neutron star. We show that the orbital motion of the neutron star induces high multipole modes of the electromagnetic field just before the merger. These modes are superimposed to form a spiral arm configuration and its edge is found to be a likely site for magnetic reconnection. These modes also enhance the total Poynting flux from neutron star binaries by a factor of 2--4. We also indicate that the electric field induced by the orbital motion lead to a magnetosphere around binaries and estimate its plasma density, which has a different parameter dependence than Goldreich-Julian density. With these properties, we discuss possible electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events, and identify radio precursors, such as fast radio bursts, as the most promising observational targets.

title: Self-similar Evolutionary Solutions for Accreting Magneto-fluid around a Compact Object with Finite Electrical Conductivity
authors: F. Habibi, R. Pazhouhesh, M. Shaghaghian
topic: In this paper, we investigate the time evolution an accreting magneto-fluid with finite conductivity. For the case of a thin disk, the fluid equations along with Maxwell equations are derived in a simplified, one-dimensional model that neglects the latitudinal dependence of the flow. The finite electrical conductivity is taken into account for the plasma through Ohm law; however, the shear viscous stress is neglected, as well as the self-gravity of the disk. In order to solve the integrated equations that govern the dynamical behaviour of the magneto-fluid, we have used a self-similar solution. We introduce two dimensionless variables, S0 and epssilon_ρ, which show the magnitude of electrical conductivity and the density behaviour with time, respectively. The effect of each of these on the structure of the disk is studied. While the pressure is obtained simply by solving an ordinary differential equation, the density, the magnetic field, the radial velocity and the rotational velocity are presented analytically.

title: The Effects of Resolution on Black Hole Accretion Simulations of Jets
authors: Christopher J. White, Fiona Chrystal 
topic: We perform three general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black hole accretion designed to test how sensitive results are to grid resolution in the jet region. The cases differ only in numerics, modelling the same physical scenario of a radiatively inefficient, geometrically thick, magnetically arrested flow onto a rapidly spinning black hole. Properties inferred with the coarsest grid generally agree with those found with higher resolutions, including total jet power and its decomposition into different forms, velocity structure, nonaxisymmetric structure, and the appearance of resolved millimetre images. Some measures of variability and magnetization are sensitive to resolution. We conclude that most results obtained by limiting resolution near the jet for computational expediency should still be reliable, at least insofar as they would not be improved with a finer grid.

topic: A compact object was observed with a mass 2.50−2.67 Msun by LIGO Scientific and Virgo collaborations (LVC) in GW190814, which provides a great challenge to the investigations into the supranuclear matter. To study this object, properties of neutron star are systematically calculated within the latest density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) parameterizations, which are determined by the ground state properties of spherical nuclei. The maximum masses of neutron star calculated by DD-MEX and DD-LZ1 sets can be around 2.55 Msun with quite stiff equations of state generated by their strong repulsive contributions from vector potentials at high densities.

title: Time dependence of advection dominated accretion flow around a rotating compact object
authors: Fahimeh Habibi
topic: Time evolution of advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) around a rotating compact object is presented. The equations of time-dependent of fluid including the Coriolis force along with the centrifugal and pressure gradient forces are derived. In this research, it is assumed that angular momentum transport is due to viscous turbulence and the {\alpha}-prescription is used for the kinematic coefficient of viscosity. Moreover, the general relativistic effects are neglected. In order to solve the equations, we have used a self-similar solution. The solutions show that the behaviour of the physical quantities in a dynamical ADAF is different from that for a steady accretion flow. Our results indicate that the physical quantities are dependent of rotation parameter which is defined as the ratio of the intrinsic angular velocity of the central body to the angular velocity of disc.

title: Modeling the Galactic Compact Binary Neutron Star Population and Studying the Double Pulsar System
authors: Nihan Pol
topic: In this dissertation, we estimate the population of different classes of BNS systems that are visible to gravitational-wave observatories. Given that no ultra-compact BNS systems have been discovered in pulsar radio surveys, we place a 95 percent confidence upper limit of ~850 and ~1100 ultra-compact neutron star--white dwarf and double neutron star (DNS) systems respectively. We show that among all of the current radio pulsar surveys, the ones at the Arecibo radio telescope have the best chance of detecting an ultra-compact BNS system. We also show that adopting a survey integration time of tint~1~min will maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, and thus, the probability of detecting an ultra-compact BNS system.

title: Magnetorotational core collapse of possible GRB progenitors. II. Formation of protomagnetars and collapsars
authors: Miguel-Ángel Aloy (1), Martin Obergaulinger 
topic: We assess the variance of the post-collapse evolution remnants of compact, massive, low-metallicity stars, under small changes in the degrees of rotation and magnetic field of selected pre-supernova cores. These stellar models are commonly considered progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts. The fate of the proto-neutron star (PNS) formed after collapse, whose mass may continuously grow due to accretion, critically depends on the poloidal magnetic field strength at bounce. Should the poloidal magnetic field be sufficiently weak, the PNS collapses to a black hole (BH) within a few seconds. Models on this evolutionary track contain promising collapsar engines. Poloidal magnetic fields smooth over large radial scales (e.g. dipolar fields) or slightly augmented with respect to the original pre-supernova core yield long-lasting PNSs. In these models, BH formation is avoided or staved off for a long time, hence, they may produce proto-magnetars (PMs). Some of our PM candidates have been run for ≲10s after core bounce, but they have not entered the Kelvin-Helmholtz phase yet.

title: Searching for the radio remnants of short duration gamma-ray bursts
authors: Roberto Ricci, Eleonora Troja, Gabriele Bruni, Tatsuya Matsumoto,
topic: Neutron star mergers produce a substantial amount of fast-moving ejecta, expanding outwardly for years after the merger. The interaction of these ejecta with the surrounding medium may produce a weak isotropic radio remnant, detectable in relatively nearby events. We use late-time radio observations of short duration gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) to constrain this model. Two samples of events were studied: four sGRBs that are possibly in the local (less 200 Mpc) universe were selected to constrain the remnant non-thermal emission from the sub-relativistic ejecta, whereas 17 sGRBs at cosmological distances were used to constrain the presence of a proto-magnetar central engine, possibly re-energezing the merger ejecta. We consider the case of GRB~170817A/GW170817, and find that in this case the early radio emission may be quenched by the jet blast-wave.

title: Multi-Wavelength Constraints on the Outflow Properties of the Extremely Bright Millisecond Radio Bursts from the Galactic Magnetar SGR 1935+2154
authors: Shotaro Yamasaki (HUJI), Kazumi Kashiyama (U. Tokyo), Kohta Murase (PSU)
topic: Recently, a bright coherent radio burst with millisecond duration, reminiscent of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs), was co-detected with an anomalously-hard X-ray burst from a Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. We investigate the possibility that the event was triggered by a deposition of a magnetic energy in a localized region of the magnetosphere, thereby producing a so-called trapped fireball (FB) and simultaneously launching relativistic outflows. We show that the thermal component of the X-ray burst spectrum is consistent with a trapped FB with an average temperature of a few hundred keV and a size of. Meanwhile, the non-thermal component of the X-ray burst and the coherent radio burst may arise from relativistic outflows. We calculate the dynamical evolution of the outflow, launched with an energy budget  comparable to that of the trapped FB.

title: MeV Gamma Rays from Fission: A Distinct Signature of Actinide Production in Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Xilu Wang, Nicole Vassh, Trevor Sprouse, Matthew Mumpower, Ramona Vogt, Jorgen Randrup, Rebecca Surman
topic: Neutron star mergers (NSMs) are the first verified site of rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, and could emit gamma rays from the radioactive isotopes synthesized in the neutron-rich ejecta. These MeV gamma rays may provide a unique and direct probe of the NSM environment as well insight into the nature of the r process, just as observed gammas from the 56Ni radioactive decay chain provide a window into supernova nucleosynthesis. In this work, we include the photons from fission processes for the first time in estimates of the MeV gamma-ray signal expected from a NSM event. We consider NSM ejecta compositions with a range of neutron richness and find a dramatic difference in the predicted signal depending on whether or not fissioning nuclei are produced.

title: New quasi-universal relations for static and rapid rotating neutron stars
authors: Wenjie Sun, Dehua Wen, Jue Wang
topic: In the last few decades, lots of universal relations between different global physical quantities of neutron stars have been proposed to constrain the unobservable or hard to be observed properties of neutron stars. But few of them are related to the gravitational redshift or the gravitational binding energy, especially for the fast rotating neutron stars. Here we will focus on the universal relations related to these two quantities. Based on 11 equations of state (EOSs) from the predictions of microscopic nuclear many-body theories for normal or hybrid neutron stars, we proposed a set of new quasi-universal relations under three rotating cases: static, general rotating and Keplerian rotating. These new quasi-universal relations provide a potential way to constrain or estimate the unobservable or hard to be observed properties of neutron stars.

title: Constraining the nuclear symmetry energy and properties of neutron star from GW170817 by Bayesian analysis
authors: Yuxi Li, Houyuan Chen, Dehua Wen, Jing Zhang
topic: Based on the distribution of tidal deformabilities and component masses of binary neutron star merger GW170817, the parametric equation of states (EOS) are employed to probe the nuclear symmetry energy and the properties of neutron star. To obtain a proper distribution of the parameters of the EOS that is consistent with the observation, Bayesian analysis is used and the constraints of causality and maximum mass are considered. From this analysis, it is found that the symmetry energy at twice the saturation density of nuclear matter can be constrained within ...
MeV at 90 percent credible level. Moreover, the constraints on the radii and dimensionless tidal deformabilities of canonical neutron stars are also demonstrated through this analysis, and the corresponding constraints are 10.80 k

title: Magnetic Energy Release, Plasma Dynamics and Particle Acceleration during Relativistic Turbulent Magnetic Reconnection
authors: Fan Guo, Xiaocan Li, William Daughton, Hui Li, Patrick Kilian, Yi-Hsin Liu, Qile Zhang, Haocheng Zhang
topic: In strongly magnetized astrophysical plasma systems, magnetic reconnection is believed to be the primary process during which explosive energy release and particle acceleration occur, leading to significant high-energy emission. Past years have seen active development of kinetic modeling of relativistic magnetic reconnection, supporting this magnetically dominated scenario. A much less explored issue in studies of relativistic reconnection is the consequence of three-dimensional dynamics, where turbulent structures are naturally generated as various types of instabilities develop. This paper presents a series of large-scale, three-dimensional, fully-kinetic simulations of relativistic turbulent magnetic reconnection (RTMR) in positron-electron plasmas. Our simulations start from a force-free current sheet with several different modes of long wavelength magnetic field perturbations, which drive additional turbulence in the reconnection region. Because of this, the current layer breaks up and the reconnection region quickly evolves into a turbulent layer filled with coherent structures such as flux ropes and current sheets. We find that plasma dynamics in RTMR is vastly different from their 2D counterparts in many aspects.

title: Formation of disks with long-lived spiral arms from violent gravitational dynamics
authors: Francesco Sylos Labini, Luis Diego Pinto, Roberto Capuzzo-Dolcetta
topic: By means of simple dynamical experiments we study the combined effect of gravitational and gas dynamics in the evolution of an initially out-of-equilibrium, uniform and rotating massive over-density thought as in isolation. The rapid variation of the system mean field potential makes the point-like particles (PP), that interact only via Newtonian gravity, to form a quasi-stationary thick disk dominated by rotational motions surrounded by far out-of-equilibrium spiral arms. On the other side, the gas component is subjected to compression shocks and radiative cooling so to develop a much flatter disk, where rotational motions are coherent and the velocity dispersion is smaller than that of PP. Around such gaseous disk long-lived, but non-stationary, spiral arms form: these are made of gaseous particles that move coherently because have acquired a specific phase-space correlation during the gravitational collapse phase. Such a phase-space correlation represents a signature of the violent origin of the arms and implies both the motion of matter and the transfer of energy.

title: GRB 140423A: A Case of Stellar Wind to Interstellar Medium Transition in the Afterglow
authors: Long Li, Xiang-Gao Wang, WeiKang Zheng, Alexei S. Pozanenko, Alexei V. Filippenko, et al
topic: We present very early ground-based optical follow-up observations of GRB~140423A, which was discovered by \emph{Swift}/BAT and by {\it Fermi}/GBM. Its broadband afterglow was monitored by {\it Swift}/XRT and ground-based optical telescopes from T0+70.96~s to 4.8~d after the {\it Swift}/BAT trigger. This is one more case of prompt optical emission observation. The temporal and spectral joint fit of the multiwavelength light curves of GRB 140423A reveals that achromatic behavior is consistent with the external shock model including a transition from a stellar wind to the interstellar medium (ISM) and energy injection. In terms of the optical light curves, there is an onset bump in the early afterglow , with a steeper to flatter "transition" . he observed X-ray afterglow reflects an achromatic behavior, as does the optical light curve. There is no obvious evolution of the spectral energy distribution between the X-ray and optical afterglow, with an average value of the photon index, Gamma = 2. This "transition" is consistent with an external shock model having the circumburst medium transition from a wind to the ISM, by introducing a long-lasting energy injection with a Lorentz factor stratification of the ejecta.

title: The infancy of core-collapse supernova remnants
authors: Michael Gabler, Annop Wongwathanarat, Hans-Thomas Janka
topic: We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-driven supernovae (SNe) with the Prometheus-HotB code, evolving the asymmetrically expanding ejecta from shock breakout until they reach the homologous expansion phase after roughly one year. Our calculations continue the simulations for two red supergiant (RSG) and two blue supergiant (BSG) progenitors by Wongwathanarat et al., who investigated the growth of explosion asymmetries produced by hydrodynamic instabilities during the first second of the explosion and their later fragmentation by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. We focus on the late time acceleration and inflation of the ejecta caused by the heating due to the radioactive decay of 56Ni to 56Fe and by a new outward-moving shock, which forms when the reverse shock from the He/H-shell interface compresses the central part of the ejecta. The mean velocities of the iron-rich ejecta increase between 100 km/s and 350 km/s (sim 8-30\%), and the fastest one percent of the iron accelerates by up to sim 1000 km/s (sim 20-25percent). This `Ni-bubble effect', known from 1D models, accelerates the bulk of the nickel in our 3D models and causes an inflation of the initially overdense Ni-rich clumps, which leads to underdense, extended fingers, enveloped by overdense skins of compressed surrounding matter.

title: Magnetohydrodynamic waves excited by a coupling between gravitational waves and a strongly magnetized plasma in binaries of neutron stars
authors: Adam S. Gontijo, Oswaldo D. Miranda
topic: Coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNSs) is one of the sources of gravitational waves (GWs) able to be detected by ground-based interferometric detectors. The event GW170817 was the first observed in the gravitational and electromagnetic spectra, showing through this joint analysis a certain compatibility with the models of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) to explain the signature of this system. Due to the intense magnetic fields of the neutron stars, the plasma magnetosphere stays strongly magnetized and the propagation of the GW through plasma can excite magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes such as Alfvén and magnetosonic waves. The MHD modes carry energy and momentum through the plasma, suggesting a mechanism to accelerate the matter during the coalescence of the binaries, explaining some characteristics of the fireball model of the sGRBs. We present a semianalytical formalism to determine the energy transferred by the GW-MHD interaction during the inspiral phase of the stars

title: Arepo-MCRT: Monte Carlo Radiation Hydrodynamics on a Moving Mesh
authors: Aaron Smith, Rahul Kannan, Benny T.-H. Tsang, Mark Vogelsberger, Ruediger Pakmor
topic: We present Arepo-MCRT, a novel Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) solver for the unstructured moving-mesh code Arepo. Our method is designed for general multiple scattering problems in both optically-thin and -thick conditions. We incorporate numerous efficiency improvements and noise reduction schemes to help overcome efficiency barriers that typically inhibit convergence. These include continuous absorption and energy deposition, photon weighting and luminosity boosting, local packet merging and splitting, path-based statistical estimators, conservative (face-centered) momentum coupling, adaptive convergence between time-steps, Implicit Monte Carlo (IMC) for thermal emission, and discrete diffusion Monte Carlo (DDMC) for unresolved scattering, including a novel advection scheme. We primarily focus on the unique aspects of our implementation and discussions of the advantages and drawbacks of our methods in various astrophysical contexts. Finally, we consider several test applications including the levitation of an optically thick layer of gas by trapped IR radiation. We find the initial acceleration phase and revitalized second wind are connected via self-regulation of the RHD coupling, such that the RHD method accuracy and simulation resolution each leave important imprints on the long-term behavior of the gas.

title: The permanent ellipticity of the neutron star in PSR J1023+0038
authors: Sudip Bhattacharyya
topic: A millisecond pulsar having an ellipticity, that is an asymmetric mass distribution around its spin-axis, could emit continuous gravitational waves, which have not been detected so far. An indirect way to infer such waves is to estimate the contribution of the waves to the spin-down rate of the pulsar. The transitional pulsar PSR J1023+0038 is ideal and unique for this purpose, because this is the only millisecond pulsar for which the spin-down rate has been measured in both accreting and non-accreting states. Here we infer, from our formalism based on the complete torque budget equations and the pulsar magnetospheric origin of observed γ-rays in the two states, that PSR J1023+0038 should emit gravitational waves due to a permanent ellipticity of the pulsar.

title: Hint of a tension between Nuclear physics and Astrophysical observations
authors: Bhaskar Biswas, Prasanta Char, Rana Nandi, Sukanta Bose
topic: Observations of neutron stars by the LIGO-Virgo and NICER collaborations have provided us reasonably precise measurements of their various macroscopic properties. In this letter, within a fully Bayesian framework, we combine them to put joint constraints on the properties of neutron stars based on an empirical parameterization of nuclear matter. These values imply a somewhat stiffer equation of state for neutron stars in comparison to those found in other studies that were based on spectral or piecewise polytropic parameterization, which are agnostic to nuclear physics constraints. This indicates a tension between nuclear physics inputs and astrophysical observations. Specifically, we show that this empirically parameterized nuclear equation of state disfavors the softness found in astrophysical observations at a statistically significant level.

title: Radiative Emission Mechanisms of Tidal Disruption Events
authors: Nathaniel Roth, Elena M. Rossi, Julian H. Krolik, Tsvi Piran, Brenna Mockler, Daniel Kasen
topic: We describe how the various outcomes of stellar tidal disruption give rise to observable radiation. We separately consider the cases where gas circularizes rapidly into an accretion disc, as well as the case when shocked debris streams provide the observable emission without having fully circularized. For the rapid circularization case, we describe how outflows, absorption by reprocessing layers, and Comptonization can cause the observed radiation to depart from that of a bare disc, possibly giving rise to the observed optical/UV emission along with soft X-rays from the disc. If, instead, most of the debris follows highly eccentric orbits for a significant time, many properties of the observed optical/UV emission can be explained by the scale of those eccentric orbits and the shocks embedded in the debris flow near orbital apocenter. In this picture, soft X-ray emission at early times results from the smaller amount of debris mass deflected into a compact accretion disc by weak shocks near the stellar pericenter. A general proposal for the near-constancy of the ultraviolet/optical color temperatures is provided, by linking it to incomplete thermalization of radiation in the atmosphere of the emitting region. We also briefly discuss the radio signals from the interaction of unbound debris and jets with the black hole environment.

title: Fast Radio Burst Breakouts from Magnetar Burst Fireballs
authors: Kunihito Ioka
topic: The recent discovery of a Mega-Jansky radio burst simultaneously with short X-ray bursts from the Galactic magnetar (strongly-magnetized neutron star (NS)) SGR 1935+2154 is a smoking gun for the hypothesis that some cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs) arise from magnetar bursts. We argue that the X-ray bursts with high temperature T∼80 keV entail an electron-positron (e plus minus) outflow from a trapped-expanding fireball, polluting the NS magnetosphere before the FRB emission. The e-(plus minus) outflow is opaque to induced Compton scatterings of FRB photons, and is strongly Compton-dragged by the X-ray bursts. Nevertheless the FRB photons can break out the e± outflow with radiation forces if the FRB emission radius is larger than a few tens of NS radii. A FRB is chocked if the FRB is weaker or X-ray bursts are stronger, possibly explaining no FRBs with giant flares and no detectable X-ray bursts with weak FRBs. We also speculate that the e (plus minus) outflow may be needed to generate FRBs, solving why the FRBs occur only with the high-T X-ray bursts. The breakout physics is important for constraining the emission mechanism and electromagnetic counterparts to future FRBs.

title: Additivity of relative magnetic helicity in finite volumes
authors: Gherardo Valori, Pascal Démoulin, Etienne Pariat, Anthony Yeates, Kostas Moraitis, Luis Linan
topic: Relative magnetic helicity is conserved by magneto-hydrodynamic evolution even in the presence of moderate resistivity. For that reason, it is often invoked as the most relevant constraint to the dynamical evolution of plasmas in complex systems, such as solar and stellar dynamos, photospheric flux emergence, solar eruptions, and relaxation processes in laboratory plasmas. However, such studies often indirectly imply that relative magnetic helicity in a given spatial domain can be algebraically split into the helicity contributions of the composing subvolumes, i.e., that it is an additive quantity. A limited number of very specific applications have shown that this is not the case. Progress in understanding the non-additivity of relative magnetic helicity requires removal of restrictive assumptions in favour of a general formalism that can be used both in theoretical investigations as well as in numerical applications. We derive the analytical gauge-invariant expression for the partition of relative magnetic helicity between contiguous finite-volumes, without any assumptions on either the shape of the volumes and interface, or the employed gauge.

authors: Giancarlo Mattia, Christian Fendt
topic: Astrophysical jets are launched from strongly magnetized systems that host an accretion disk surrounding a central object. Here we address the question how to generate the accretion disk magnetization and field structure required for jet launching. We continue our work from Paper I (Mattia & Fendt 2020a), considering a non-scalar accretion disk mean-field alpha2Omega-dynamo in the context of large scale disk-jet simulations. We now investigate a disk dynamo that follows analytical solutions of mean-field dynamo theory, essentially based only on a single parameter, the Coriolis number. We thereby confirm the anisotropy of the dynamo tensor acting in accretion disks, allowing to relate both the resistivity and mean-field dynamo to the disk turbulence. Our new model recovers previous simulations applying a purely radial initial field, while allowing for a more stable evolution for seed fields with a vertical component. We also present correlations between the strength of the disk dynamo coefficients and the dynamical parameters of the jet that is launched, and discuss their implication for observed jet quantities.

authors: Igor Andreoni, Erik C. Kool, Ana Sagues Carracedo, Mansi M. Kasliwal, Mattia Bulla, Tomas Ahumada, et al
topic: To date, no compelling kilonova has been found during optical surveys of the sky, independent of gravitational-wave triggers. In this work, we searched the first 23 months of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data stream for candidate kilonovae in the form of rapidly evolving transients. We combined ZTF alert queries with forced point-spread-function photometry and nightly flux stacking to increase our sensitivity to faint and fast transients. Automatic queries yielded >11,200 candidates, 24 of which passed quality checks and strict selection criteria based on a grid of kilonova models tailored for both binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers. None of the candidates in our sample was deemed a possible kilonova after thorough vetting, catalog cross-matching, and study of their color evolution. The sources that passed our selection criteria are dominated by Galactic cataclysmic variables. In addition, we identified two fast transients at high Galactic latitude, one of which is the confirmed afterglow of long-duration GRB190106A, and the other is a possible cosmological afterglow. Using a survey simulation code, we constrained the kilonova rate for a range of models including top-hat and linearly decaying light curves and synthetic light curves obtained with radiative transfer simulations.

title: High-Energy Neutrinos and Gamma-Rays from Non-Relativistic Shock-Powered Transients
authors: Ke Fang, Brian D. Metzger, Indrek Vurm, Elias Aydi, Laura Chomiuk
topic: Shock interaction has been argued to play a role in powering a range of optical transients, including supernovae (particularly the superluminous class), classical novae, stellar mergers, tidal disruption events, and fast blue optical transients. These same shocks can accelerate relativistic ions, generating high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission via hadronic pion production. The recent discovery of time-correlated optical and gamma-ray emission in classical novae has revealed the important role of radiative shocks in powering these events, enabling an unprecedented view of the properties of ion acceleration, including its efficiency and energy spectrum, under similar physical conditions to shocks in extragalactic transients. Here we introduce a model for connecting the radiated optical fluence of non-relativistic transients to their maximal neutrino and gamma-ray fluence. We apply this technique to a wide range of extragalactic transient classes in order to place limits on their contributions to the cosmological high-energy gamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds.

title: MHD accretion-ejection: jets launched by a non-isotropic accretion disk dynamo. I. Validation and application of selected dynamo tensorial components
authors: Giancarlo Mattia, Christian Fendt
topic: Astrophysical jets are launched from strongly magnetized systems that host an accretion disk surrounding a central object. The origin of the jet launching magnetic field is one of the open questions for modeling the accretion-ejection process. Here we address the question how to generate the accretion disk magnetization and field structure required for jet launching. Applying the PLUTO code, we present the first resistive MHD simulations of jet launching including a non-scalar accretion disk mean-field alpha^2Omega-dynamo in the context of large scale disk-jet simulations. Essentially, we find the alpha-phi-dynamo component determining the amplification of the poloidal magnetic field, which is strictly related to the disk magnetization (and, as a consequence, to the jet speed, mass and collimation), while the αR and αθ-dynamo components trigger the formation of multiple, anti-aligned magnetic loops in the disk, with strong consequences on the stability and dynamics of the disk-jet system. In particular, such loops trigger the formation of dynamo inefficient zones, which are characterized by a weak magnetic field, and therefore a lower value of the magnetic diffusivity. The jet mass, speed and collimation are strongly affected by the formation of the dynamo inefficient zones.

title: Updated predictions for gravitational waves produced in a strongly supercooled phase transition
authors: John Ellis, Marek Lewicki, Ville Vaskonen
topic: We update predictions for the gravitational wave (GW) signal from a strongly supercooled phase transition in an illustrative classically conformal U(1)B−L model. We implement prop gamma^2 scaling of the friction on the bubble wall and update the estimates for the efficiency factors for GW production from bubble collisions and plasma-related sources. We take into account the fact that a small decay rate of the symmetry-breaking field may lead to brief matter-dominated era after the transition, as the field oscillates around its minimum before decaying.  We find that a strong bubble collision signal occurs in a significant part of the parameter space, and that the modified redshift of the modes that re-enter the horizon during the matter-dominated period generates a characteristic tilted `plateau' in the spectrum.

It is found that all of the rest-frame absolute spectral widths are strongly positive correlated with Eiso as well as Liso for the long burst for both the F and P spectra. All of the short bursts are the outliers for width-Eiso relation and most of the short bursts are consistent with the long bursts for the width-Liso relation for both F and P spectra.

topic: We report on the gravitational wave signal computed in the context of a three-dimensional simulation of a core collapse supernova explosion of a 15 Solar mass star. The simulation was performed with our neutrino hydrodynamics code Chimera. We detail the gravitational wave strains as a function of time, for both polarizations, and discuss their physical origins. We also present the corresponding spectral signatures. Gravitational wave emission in our model has two key features: low-frequency emission (less 200 Hz) emanates from the gain layer as a result of neutrino-driven convection and the SASI and high-frequency emission (> 600 Hz) emanates from the proto-neutron star due to Ledoux convection within it. The high-frequency emission dominates the gravitational wave emission in our model and emanates largely from the convective layer itself, not from the convectively stable layer above it, due to convective overshoot. Moreover, the low-frequency emission emanates from the gain layer itself, not from the proto-neutron star, due to accretion onto it. We provide evidence of the SASI in our model and demonstrate that the peak of our low-frequency gravitational wave emission spectrum corresponds to it.

With this, we numerically solve the stellar equilibrium equations to find a range of models, including magnetic fields and rotation up to Keplerian velocity. We argue that the equation of state is effectively barotropic for this problem. For fixed magnetic-field strength, the induced ellipticity increases with temperature; we give quantitative formulae for this. The Keplerian velocity is considerably lower for hotter stars, which may set a de-facto maximum rotation rate for non-recycled NSs well below 1 kHz. The qualitative magnetic-field structure is similar for hot and cold stars, with the poloidal field component dominating over the toroidal one; we argue this result may be universal. We show that truncating magnetic-field solutions at low multipoles leads to serious inaccuracies, especially for models with rapid rotation or a strong toroidal-field component.

title: Gravitational wave background from extreme mass ratio inspirals
authors: Matteo Bonetti, Alberto Sesana
topic: Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), i.e. binary systems comprised by a compact stellar-mass object orbiting a massive black hole, are expected to be among the primary gravitational wave (GW) sources for the forthcoming LISA mission. The astrophysical processes leading to the formation of such systems still remain poorly understood, resulting into large uncertainties in the predicted cosmic rate of these sources, spanning at least three orders of magnitude. As LISA can individually resolve mostly EMRIs up to z≳1, the ensemble of signals below its detection threshold will add up incoherently forming an unresolved confusion noise, which can be formally described as a stochastic background. We perform an extensive study of this background by considering a collection of astrophysically motivated EMRI formation scenarios, spanning current uncertainties. We find that in fiducial EMRI models -- predicting hundreds of EMRI detections during mission operations -- a significant background comparable to the LISA noise emerges, affecting the performance of the instrument around 3 mHz. In extreme cases, this background can even "erase" the whole LISA sensitivity bucket in the 2-10 mHz frequency range

title: A coupled guiding center-Boris particle pusher for magnetized plasmas in compact-object magnetospheres
authors: Fabio Bacchini, Bart Ripperda, Alexander A. Philippov, Kyle Parfrey
topic: We present a novel numerical scheme for simulating the motion of relativistic charged particles in magnetospheres of compact objects, typically filled with highly magnetized collisionless plasmas. The new algorithm is based on a dynamic switch between the full system of equations of motion and a guiding center approximation. The switch between the two formulations is based on the magnetization of the plasma particles, such that the dynamics are accurately captured by the guiding center motion even when the gyro-frequency is under-resolved by the time step. For particles with a large gyro-radius, due to acceleration in, e.g., reconnecting current sheets, the algorithm adaptively switches to solve the full equations of motion instead. The new scheme is directly compatible with standard Particle-in-Cell codes, and is readily applicable in curved spacetimes via a dedicated covariant formulation.

title: Magnetic field fluctuations in anisotropic, supersonic turbulence
authors: James R. Beattie, Christoph Federrath, Amit Seta
topic: The rich structure that we observe in molecular clouds is due to the interplay between strong magnetic fields and supersonic (turbulent) velocity fluctuations. The velocity fluctuations interact with the magnetic field, causing it too to fluctuate. Using numerical simulations, we explore the nature of such magnetic field fluctuations  over a wide range of turbulent Mach numbers (i.e., from weak to strong compressibility), and Alfven Mach numbers (i.e., from strong to weak magnetic mean fields, B0) We derive a compressible quasi-static fluctuation model from the magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations and show that velocity gradients parallel to the mean magnetic field give rise to compressible modes in sub-Alfvénic flows, which prevents the flow from becoming two-dimensional, as is the case in incompressible MHD turbulence.

authors: Nipuni T. Palliyaguru, Devansh Agarwal, Golnoosh Golpayegani, Ryan Lynch, Duncan R. Lorimer, Benjamin Nguyen, Alessandra Corsi, Sarah Burke-Spolaor
topic: The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) still remains a mystery, even with the increased number of discoveries in the last three years. Growing evidence suggests that some FRBs may originate from magnetars. Large, single-dish telescopes such as Arecibo Observatory (AO) and Green Bank Telescope (GBT) have the sensitivity to detect FRB~121102-like bursts at gigaparsec distances. Here we present searches using AO and GBT that aimed to find potential radio bursts at 11 sites of past γ--ray bursts that show evidence for the birth of a magnetar. We also performed a search towards GW170817, which has a merger remnant whose nature remains uncertain

title: Diverse Jet Structures Consistent with the Off-axis Afterglow of GRB 170817A
authors: Kazuya Takahashi, Kunihito Ioka
topic: The jet structure of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been controversial after the detection of GRB 170817A as the electromagnetic counterparts to the gravitational wave event GW170817. Different authors use different jet structures for calculating the afterglow light curves. We formulated a method to inversely reconstruct the jet structure uniquely from a given off-axis GRB afterglow, without assuming any functional form of the structure. By systematically applying our inversion method, we find that more diverse jet structures are consistent with the observed afterglow of GRB 170817A within errors: such as hollow-cone, spindle, Gaussian, and power-law jet structures. In addition, the total energy of the reconstructed jet is arbitrary, proportional to the ambient density n0, with keeping the same jet shape if the parameters satisfy the degeneracy combination

title: Convective turbulent viscosity acting on equilibrium tidal flows: new frequency scaling of the effective viscosity
authors: Craig D. Duguid, Adrian J. Barker, Chris A. Jones
topic: Turbulent convection is thought to act as an effective viscosity (νE) in damping tidal flows in stars and giant planets. However, the efficiency of this mechanism has long been debated, particularly in the regime of fast tides, when the tidal frequency (ω) exceeds the turnover frequency of the dominant convective eddies (ωc). We present the results of hydrodynamical simulations to study the interaction between tidal flows and convection in a small patch of a convection zone. These simulations build upon our prior work by simulating more turbulent convection in larger horizontal boxes, and here we explore a wider range of parameters.

title: Does elasticity stabilise a magnetic neutron star?
authors: Prasanta Bera, D. I. Jones, Nils Andersson
topic: The configuration of the magnetic field in the interior of a neutron star is mostly unknown from observations. Theoretical models of the interior magnetic field geometry tend to be oversimplified to avoid mathematical complexity and tend to be based on axisymmetric barotropic fluid systems. These static magnetic equilibrium configurations have been shown to be unstable on a short time scale against an infinitesimal perturbation. Given this instability, it is relevant to consider how more realistic neutron star physics affects the outcome. In particular, it makes sense to ask if elasticity, which provides an additional restoring force on the perturbations, may stabilise the system. It is well-known that the matter in the neutron star crust forms an ionic crystal. The interactions between the crystallized nuclei can generate shear stress against any applied strain. To incorporate the effect of the crust on the dynamical evolution of the perturbed equilibrium structure, we study the effect of elasticity on the instability of an axisymmetric magnetic star. In particular we determine the critical shear modulus required to prevent magnetic instability and consider the corresponding astrophysical consequences.

title: The Fate of the Merger Remnant in GW170817 and its Imprint on the Jet Structure
authors: Ariadna Murguia-Berthier, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Fabio De Colle, Agnieszka Janiuk, Stephan Rosswog, William H. Lee
topic: The first neutron star binary merger detected in gravitational waves, GW170817 and the subsequent detection of its emission across the electromagnetic spectrum showed that these systems are viable progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRB). The afterglow signal of GW170817 has been found to be consistent with a structured GRB jet seen off-axis, requiring significant amounts of relativistic material at large angles. This trait can be attributed to the interaction of the relativistic jet with the external wind medium. Here we perform numerical simulations of relativistic jets interacting with realistic wind environments in order to explore how the properties of the wind and central engine affect the structure of successful jets. We find that the angular energy distribution of the jet depends primarily on the ratio between the lifetime of the jet and the time it takes the merger remnant to collapse. We make use of these simulations to constrain the time it took for the merger remnant in GW170817 to collapse into a black hole based on the angular structure of the jet as inferred from afterglow observations. We conclude that the lifetime of the merger remnant in GW170817 was ≈0.8−0.9s, which, after collapse, triggered the formation of the jet.

title: Multi-Frequency General Relativistic Radiation-Hydrodynamics with M1 Closure
authors: Peter Anninos, P. Chris Fragile
topic: We report on recent upgrades to our general relativistic radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code, Cosmos++, which expands the two-moment, M1, radiation treatment from grey to multi-frequency transport, including Doppler and gravitational frequency shifts. The solver accommodates either photon (Bose-Einstein) or neutrino (Fermi-Dirac) statistical distribution functions with absorption, emission, and elastic scattering processes. An implicit scheme is implemented to simultaneously solve the primitive inversion problem together with the radiation-matter coupling source terms, providing stability over a broad range of opacities and optical depths where the interactions terms can be stiff. We discuss our formulations and numerical methods, and validate our methods against a wide variety of test problems spanning optically thin to thick regimes in flat, weakly curved, and strongly curved spacetimes.

authors: James H. Gillanders, Stuart A. Sim, Stephen J. Smartt
topic: We present detailed spectroscopic analysis of the extraordinarily fast-evolving transient AT2018kzr. The transient's observed lightcurve showed a rapid decline rate, comparable to the kilonova AT2017gfo. We calculate a self-consistent sequence of radiative transfer models (using TARDIS) and determine that the ejecta material is dominated by intermediate-mass elements (O, Mg and Si), with a photospheric velocity of ∼12000-14500km/s. The early spectra have the unusual combination of being blue but dominated by strong FeII and FeIII absorption features. We show that this combination is only possible with a high Fe content (3.5%). This implies a high Fe/(Ni+Co) ratio.

title: Superfluid vortex-mediated mutual friction in non-homogeneous neutron star interiors
authors: Marco Antonelli, Brynmor Haskell
topic: Understanding the average motion of a multitude of superfluid vortices in the interior of a neutron star is a key ingredient for most theories of pulsar glitches. In this paper we propose a kinetic approach to compute the mutual friction force that is responsible for the momentum exchange between the normal and superfluid components in a neutron star, where the mutual friction is extracted from a suitable average over the motion of many vortex lines. As a first step towards a better modelling of the repinning and depinning processes of many vortex lines in a neutron star, we consider here only straight and non-interacting vortices: we adopt a minimal model for the dynamics of an ensemble of point vortices in two dimensions immersed in a non-homogeneous medium that acts as a pinning landscape.

title: The structure of weakly-magnetized gamma-ray burst jets
authors: Ore Gottlieb, Omer Bromberg, Chandra B. Singh, Ehud Nakar
topic: The interaction of gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets with the dense media into which they are launched promote the growth of local hydrodynamic instabilities along the jet boundary. In a companion paper (Gottlieb2020b) we study the evolution of hydrodynamic (unmagnetized) jets, finding that mixing of jet-cocoon material gives rise to an interface layer, termed jet-cocoon interface (JCI), which contains a significant fraction of the system energy. We find that the angular structure of the jet + JCI, when they reach the homologous phase, can be approximated by a flat core (the jet) + a power-law function (the JCI) with indices that depend on the degree of mixing. In this paper we examine the effect of subdominant toroidal magnetic fields on the jet evolution and morphology. We find that weak fields can stabilize the jet against local instabilities. The suppression of the mixing diminishes the JCI and thus reshapes the jet's post-breakout structure.

topic: Determination of a magnetic field structure on a neutron star (NS) surface is an important problem of a modern astrophysics. In a presence of strong magnetic fields a thermal conductivity of a degenerate matter is anisotropic. In this paper we present 3D anisotropic heat transfer simulations in outer layers of magnetized NSs, and construct synthetic thermal light curves. We have used a different from previous works tensorial thermal conductivity coefficient of electrons, derived from the analytical solution of the Boltzmann equation by the Chapman-Enskog method. We have obtained a NS surface temperature distribution in presence of dipole-plus-quadrupole magnetic fields. We consider a case, in which magnetic axes of a dipole and quadrupole components of the magnetic field are not aligned.

title: On the maximum mass of neutron stars and GW190814
authors: Daniel A. Godzieba, David Radice, Sebastiano Bernuzzi
topic: Motivated by the recent discovery of a compact object with mass in the range 2.5−2.67M⊙ in the binary merger GW190814, we revisit the question of the maximum mass of neutron stars (NSs). We use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to generate about 2 million phenomenological equations of state with and without first order phase transitions. We fix the crust equation of state and only assume causality at higher densities. We derive strict upper bounds on the maximum mass of NSs that depend on bulk properties of NSs, such as the radii and the tidal deformabilities of reference NSs. We find that the presence of a NS in GW190814 is not inconsistent with present astronomical constraints on the NS equation of state, but could be ruled out with near-future NICER and/or LIGO/Virgo observations.

title: Alfvén wave mode conversion in pulsar magnetospheres
authors: Yajie Yuan, Yuri Levin, Ashley Bransgrove, Alexander Philippov
topic: The radio emission anomaly coincident with the 2016 glitch of the Vela pulsar may be caused by a star quake that launches Alfvén waves into the magnetosphere, disturbing the original radio emitting region. To quantify the lifetime of the Alfvén waves, we investigate a possible energy loss mechanism, the conversion of Alfvénwaves into fast magnetosonic waves. Using axisymmetric force-free simulations, we follow the propagation of Alfvén waves launched from the stellar surface with small amplitude into the closed zone of a force-free dipolar pulsar magnetosphere. We observe mode conversion happening in the ideal force-free regime. The conversion efficiency during the first passage of the Alfvén wave through the equator can be large, for waves that reach large amplitudes as they travel away from the star, or propagate on the field lines passing close to the Y-point.

title: Nuclear pasta in hot and dense matter and its influence on the equation of state for astrophysical simulations
authors: Fan Ji, Jinniu Hu, Shishao Bao, Hong Shen
topic: We explore the properties of nuclear pasta appearing in supernova matter, i.e., matter at finite temperature with a fixed proton fraction. The pasta phases with a series of geometric shapes are studied using the compressible liquid-drop (CLD) model, where nuclear matter separates into a dense liquid phase of nucleons and a dilute gas phase of nucleons and α particles. The equilibrium conditions for two coexisting phases are derived by minimization of the total free energy including the surface and Coulomb contributions, which are clearly different from the Gibbs conditions for phase equilibrium due to the finite-size effects. Compared to the results considering only spherical nuclei, the inclusion of pasta phases can delay the transition to uniform matter and enlarge the region of nonuniform matter in the phase diagram. The thermodynamic quantities obtained in the present calculation with the CLD model are consistent with those in the realistic equation of state table for astrophysical simulations using the Thomas--Fermi approximation.

title: The different flavors of extragalactic jets: the role of relativistic flow deceleration
authors: P. Rossi, G. Bodo, S. Massaglia, A. Capetti
topic: We perform three-dimensional numerical simulations of relativistic (with a Lorentz factor of 10), non magnetized jets propagating in a uniform density environment, in order to study the effect of the entrainment and the consequent deceleration. Our simulations investigate the jet propagation inside the galaxy core, where, most likely, the deceleration occurs more efficiently. We compare cases with different density and pressure ratios with respect to the ambient medium finding that low density jets are efficiently decelerated and reach a quasi steady state in which, over a length of 600 jet radii, slow down from highly to sub-relativistic velocities. At the opposite, denser jets keep highly relativistic velocity over the same length. We discuss these results in relation to the Faranoff Riley (FR) radio-sources classification. We infer that lower density jets can give rise to FR 0 and FR I radio-sources, while higher density jets may be connected to FR II radio-sources.

title: Primordial black hole origin for thermal gamma-ray bursts
authors: Oscar del Barco
topic: A binary black hole (BH) astrophysical scenario where a mass-constrained primordial black hole (PBH) undergoes a spiral fall onto its heavier component (such as a supermassive black hole (SMBH)) is described as an intense gamma-ray emission event. As the infalling BH approaches the Schwarschild surface of its companion, the PBH evaporation rate becomes more strongly enhanced due to the PBH blueshifted emission towards the SMBH, until a complete evaporation occurs before reaching the central BH horizon. Accordingly, our numerically calculated PBH flux density F(nu) and nuF(nu)ν fluence spectrum show an increasing Planck-like spectral dependence consistent with the first instants of thermal-dominant gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), providing a plausible confirmation of such low-mass primordial ultracompact objects.

Shutz in 1986 using only gravitational waves to infer the Hubble constant (H0) from GW190814, the first first high-probability neutron-star--black-hole (NS-BH) merger candidate detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo interferometer. We apply a baseline test of this method to the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and find [large uncertanty] demonstrating the improvement on constraints when using multiple gravitational wave events. We also confirm the results of other works that adopt this method, showing that increasing the LB threshold enhances the posterior structure and slightly shifts the distribution's peak to higher H0 values.

title: Jet Propagation in Expanding Medium for Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Hamid Hamidani, Kunihito Ioka
topic: The binary neutron star (BNS) merger event GW170817 clearly shows that a BNS merger launches a short Gamma-Ray Burst (sGRB) jet. Unlike collapsars, where the ambient medium is static, in BNS mergers the jet propagates through the merger ejecta that is expanding outward at substantial velocities (∼0.2c). Here, we present semi-analytic and analytic models to solve the propagation of GRB jets through their surrounding media. We also perform a series of 2D numerical simulations of jet propagation in BNS mergers and in collapsars to test our models. Our models are consistent with numerical simulations in every aspect (the jet head radius, the cocoon's lateral width, the jet opening angle including collimation, the cocoon pressure, and the jet-cocoon morphology). The energy composition of the cocoon is found to be different depending on whether the ambient medium is expanding or not; in the case of BNS merger jets, the cocoon energy is dominated by kinetic energy, while it is dominated by internal energy in collapsars. Our model will be useful for estimating electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves.

Thermal effects are introduced in a self-consistent way and a set of isothermal equations of state are predicted.

authors: Zacharias Roupas
topic: The gravitational-wave signal GW190814 involves a compact object with mass (2.50−2.67)Msun within the so-called low mass gap. As yet, a general consensus on its nature, being a black hole, a neutron star or an exotic star, has not been achieved. We investigate the possibility this compact object to be an anisotropic neutron star. Anisotropies in a neutron star core arise naturally by effects such as superfluidity, hyperons, strong magnetic fields and allow the maximum mass to exceed that of the ideally isotropic stars. We consider the Krori-Barua ansatz to model an anisotropic core and constrain the equation of state with LIGO/Virgo observations GW170817 and GW190814.

title: Massive neutron stars with multiquark cores
authors: Sitthichai Pinkanjanarod, Piyabut Burikham
topic: In the core of NS, it is possible that the density and pressure become so large that the nuclear matter undergoes phase transition into a deconfined phase, consisting of quarks and gluons and their colour bound states. Even though the quark-gluon plasma has been observed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions\cite{Gyulassy, Andronic}, it is still unclear whether exotic quark matter exists inside neutron stars. Recently the result from the combination of various perturbative theoretical calculations with astronomical observations\cite{Demorest, Antoniadis} shows that (exotic) quark matter could exist inside the cores of neutron stars above 2.0 solar masses (Msun)~\cite{Annala:2019puf} However, due to the nonperturbative characteristic of interactions between quarks and gluons in the deconfined phase, perturbative QCD~(pQCD) has limitation due to the possibly large coupling of the quark-gluon soup in such dense environment. We revisit the holographic model in Ref.~\cite{bch, bhp} and implement the equation of states~(EoS) of multiquark nuclear matter interpolating from the high-density pQCD EoS and matching with the nuclear EoS known at low densities.

authors: S. Walsh, S. McBreen, A. Martin-Carrillo, T. Dauser, N. Wijers, J. Wilms, J. Schaye, D. Barret
topic: At low redshifts, the observed baryonic density falls far short of the total number of baryons predicted. Cosmological simulations suggest that these baryons reside in filamentary gas structures, known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). As a result of the high temperatures of these filaments, the matter is highly ionised such that it absorbs and emits far-UV and soft X-ray photons. Athena, the proposed European Space Agency X-ray observatory, aims to detect the `missing' baryons in the WHIM up to redshifts of z=1 through absorption in active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra, allowing for the study of the evolution of these large-scale structures of the Universe. This work simulates WHIM filaments in the spectra of GRB X-ray afterglows with Athena using the SImulation of X-ray TElescopes (SIXTE) framework.

topic: In this undergraduate project, f-mode oscillations in neutron stars are used to constrain the equation of state of dense matter. For the first time, a systematic investigation of the role of nuclear saturation parameters on the mode oscillations is performed. It is found that the uncertainty in the determination of effective nucleon mass plays the most significant role in controlling the f-mode frequencies. Correlations of the frequencies with astrophysical observables relevant for asteroseismology are also investigated. Future detection of f-mode frequencies could then provide a unique way of constraining nuclear empirical parameters and therefore the behaviour of dense matter.

title: Confronting GW190814 with hyperonization in dense matter and hypernuclear compact stars
authors: Armen Sedrakian, Fridolin Weber, Jia-Jie LI
topic: We examine the possibility that the light companion in the highly asymmetric binary compact object coalescence event GW190814 is a hypernuclear star. We use density functional theory with functionals that have been tuned to the properties of Lambda hypernuclei as well as astrophysical constraints placed by the masses of the most massive millisecond pulsars, the mass-radius range inferred from the NICER experiment, and the binary neutron star merger event GW170817. We compute general-relativistic static and maximally rotating Keplerian configurations of purely nucleonic and hypernuclear stars. We find that while nucleonic stars are broadly consistent with a neutron star being involved in GW190814, this would imply no new degrees of freedom in the dense matter up to 6.5 times the nuclear saturation density. Allowing for hyperonization of dense matter, we find that the maximal masses of hypernuclear stars, even for maximal rapidly rotating configurations, are inconsistent with a stellar nature interpretation of the light companion in GW190814, implying that this event involved two black holes rather than a neutron star and a black hole.

authors: Zacharias Roupas, Gamal G. L. Nashed
topic: Dense nuclear matter is expected to be anisotropic due to effects such as solidification, superfluidity, strong magnetic fields, hyperons, pion-condesation. Therefore an anisotropic pulsars core seems more realistic than an ideally isotropic one. We model anisotropic neutron stars working in the Krori-Barua (KB) ansatz without preassuming an equation of state. We show that the physics of general KB solutions is encapsulated in the compactness. Imposing physical and stability requirements yields a maximum allowed compactness. We further input observational data from numerous pulsars and calculate the boundary density. We focus especially on data from the LIGO/Virgo collaboration as well as recent independent measurements of mass and radius of miilisecond pulsars with white dwarf companions by the \textit{Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer} (NICER).

title: Bao-Minh Hoang, Smadar Naoz, Kyle Kremer
authors: LIGO's third observing run (O3) has reported several neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger candidates. From a theoretical point of view, NSBH mergers have received less attention in the community than either binary black holes (BBHs), or binary neutron stars (BNSs). Here we examine single-single (sin-sin) gravitational wave (GW) captures in different types of star clusters -- galactic nuclei (GN), globular clusters (GC), and young stellar clusters (YSC) -- and compare the merger rates from this channel to other proposed merger channels in the literature. There are currently large uncertainties associated with every merger channel, making a definitive conclusion about the origin of NSBH mergers impossible. However, keeping these uncertainties in mind, we find that sin-sin GW capture is unlikely to significantly contribute to the overall NSBH merger rate. In general, it appears that isolated binary evolution in the field or in clusters, and dynamically interacting binaries in triple configurations, may result in a higher merger rate.

title: The Sound of Clearing the Throat: Gravitational Waves from a Black Hole Orbiting in a Wormhole Geometry
authors: James B. Dent, William E. Gabella, Kelly Holley-Bockelmann, Thomas W. Kephart
topic: Current ground-based gravitational wave detectors are tuned to capture the collision of compact objects such as stellar origin black holes and neutron stars; over 20 such events have been published to date. Theoretically, however, more exotic compact objects may exist, collisions of which should also generate copious gravitational waves. In this paper, we model the inspiral of a stellar mass black hole into a stable, non-spinning, traversable wormhole, and find a characteristic waveform -- an anti-chirp and/or burst -- as the black hole emerges, i.e., outspirals, into our region of the Universe. This novel waveform signature may be useful in searches for wormholes in future gravitational wave data or used to constrain possible wormhole geometries in our Universe.

title: GW190814 as a massive rapidly-rotating neutron star with exotic degrees of freedom
authors: V. Dexheimer, R.O. Gomes, T. Klähn, S. Han, M. Salinas
topic: In the context of the massive secondary object recently observed in the compact-star merger GW190814, we investigate the possibility of producing massive neutron stars from equation of state models that contain exotic degrees of freedom, such as hyperons and quarks. Our work shows that state-of-the-art relativistic mean field models can generate massive stars reaching geq 2.05 MSun, while being in good agreement with gravitational-wave events and x-ray pulsar observations, when quark vector interactions and higher-order self-vector interactions are introduced. When rapid rotation is added, our models generate stellar masses that approach, and in some cases surpass 2.5 MSun. We find that in such cases fast rotation does not necessarily suppress exotic degrees of freedom due to changes in stellar central density compared to non-rotating cases.

title: Simulating jets from a neutron star companion hours after a core collapse supernova
authors: Muhammad Akashi, Noam Soker 
topic: We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to explore the interaction of jets that a neutron star (NS) companion to a type Ic or type Ib core collapse supernova (CCSN) launches few hours after explosion with the ejecta of the CCSN. We assume that a NS companion at 5Ro from the exploding star accretes mass from the slower inner ejecta through an accretion disk, and that the disk launches two opposite jets. Although the energy of the jets is only about one per cent of the total energy of the ejecta, it is comparable to the energy of the slower inner part of the ejecta. We find that the jets inflate one low-density hot bubble to one side of the ejecta, and that this bubble expands to influence ejecta gas up to expansion velocities of v(ej)=3500 km/s. The post-shock jets' material develops a large meridional flow and small vortexes. The boundary between the ejecta and jets' post-shock gases is unstable. The instabilities and vortexes mix jets' gas with the ejecta. We expect such a hot bubble to contribute to the light curve of CCSNe that are progenitors of binary NS systems, in particular to observers on the side of the bubble.

title: Inverse energy transfer in decaying, three dimensional, nonhelical magnetic turbulence due to magnetic reconnection
authors: Pallavi Bhat, Muni Zhou, Nuno F. Loureiro
topic: It has been recently shown numerically that there exists an inverse transfer of magnetic energy in decaying, nonhelical, magnetically dominated, magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in 3-dimensions (3D). We suggest that magnetic reconnection is the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this inverse transfer. In the two-dimensional (2D) case, the inverse transfer is easily inferred to be due to smaller magnetic islands merging to form larger ones via reconnection. We find that the scaling behaviour is similar between the 2D and the 3D cases, i.e., the magnetic energy evolves as t−1, and the magnetic power spectrum follows a slope of k−2.

title: Magnetic field transport in compact binaries
authors: Nicolas Scepi, Geoffroy Lesur, Guillaume Dubus, Jonatan Jacquemin-Ide
topic: Dwarf novae (DNe) and low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) show eruptions that are thought to be due to a thermal-viscous instability in their accretion disk. These eruptions provide constraints on angular momentum transport mechanisms. We explore the idea that angular momentum transport could be controlled by the dynamical evolution of the large scale magnetic field. We study the impact of different prescriptions for the magnetic field evolution on the dynamics of the disk. This is a first step in confronting the theory of magnetic field transport with observations. We develop a version of the disk instability model that evolves the density, the temperature and the large scale vertical magnetic flux together. We take into account the accretion driven by turbulence or by a magnetized outflow. To evolve the magnetic flux, we use a toy model with physically motivated prescriptions depending mainly on the local magnetization. We find that allowing magnetic flux to be advected inwards provides the best agreement with DNe lightcurves.

authors: Paz Beniamini, Pawan Kumar
topic: Light-curve variability timescales, the small ratio of rise time of the flux to pulse duration, and the spectro-temporal correlations in the data constrain the compactness of the source and the mechanism responsible for the powerful radio emission. The constraints are strongest when radiation is produced far (less 1010cm) from the compact object. We describe different physical set-ups that can account for the observed despite having large emission radii.

title: Gravitational Waves from Neutrino Asymmetries in Core-Collapse Supernovae
authors: David Vartanyan, Adam Burrows
topic: We present a broadband spectrum of gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) sourced by neutrino emission asymmetries for a series of full 3D simulations. The associated gravitational wave strain probes the long-term secular evolution of CCSNe and small-scale turbulent activity and provides insight into the geometry of the explosion. For non-exploding models, both the neutrino luminosity and the neutrino gravitational waveform will encode information about the spiral SASI. The neutrino memory will be detectable for a wide range of progenitor masses for a galactic event. Our results can be used to guide near-future decihertz and long-baseline gravitational-wave detection programs, including aLIGO, the Einstein Telescope, and DECIGO.

title: Near-infrared emission lines trace the state-independent accretion disc wind of the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070
authors: Javier Sánchez-Sierras, Teo Muñoz-Darias
topic: The black hole transient MAXI J1820+070 displayed optical P-Cyg profiles and other wind-related emission line features during the hard state of its discovery outburst. We present near-infrared (nIR) spectroscopy covering the different accretion states of the system during this event. Our 8-epoch data set (VLT/X-shooter) reveals strong variability in the properties of the nIR emission lines. This includes the presence of absorption troughs and extended emission line wings with kinetic properties that are remarkably similar to those inferred from the wind signatures observed in optical emission lines, indicating that they are most likely tracing the same accretion disc wind. Unlike the optical features, these nIR signatures are not exclusive of the hard state, as they are also witnessed across the soft state with similar observational properties. This supports the presence of a relatively steady outflow during the entire outburst of the system, and represents the first detection of an accretion disc wind in a black hole soft state at energies other than X-rays. We discuss the visibility of the wind as a function of the spectral band and the potential of nIR spectroscopy for wind studies, in particular during luminous accretion phases.

title: Gravitational-wave selection effects using neural-network classifiers
authors: Davide Gerosa, Geraint Pratten, Alberto Vecchio
topic: We present a novel machine-learning approach to estimate selection effects in gravitational-wave observations. Using techniques similar to those commonly employed in image classification and pattern recognition, we train a series of neural-network classifiers to predict the LIGO/Virgo detectability of gravitational-wave signals from compact-binary mergers. We include the effect of spin precession, higher-order modes, and multiple detectors and show that their omission, as it is common in large population studies, tends to overestimate the inferred merger rate in selected regions of the parameter space. Although here we train our classifiers using a simple signal-to-noise ratio threshold, our approach is ready to be used in conjunction with full pipeline injections, thus paving the way toward including actual distributions of astrophysical and noise triggers into gravitational-wave population analyses.

title: Can we trust MHD jump conditions for collisionless shocks?
authors: Antoine Bret
topic: When applied to compute the density jump of a shock, the standard magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) formalism assumes, 1) that all the upstream material passes downstream, together with the momentum and energy it carries, and 2) that pressures are isotropic. In a collisionless shock, shock accelerated particles going back and forth around the front can invalid the first assumption. In addition, an external magnetic field can sustain stable pressure anisotropies, invaliding the second assumption. It is therefore unclear whether the density jump of a collisionless shock fulfils the MHD jump or not.
Here we try to clarify this issue. A literature review is conducted on 68 articles dealing with Particle-In-Cell simulations of collisionless shocks. We analyze the factors triggering departure from the MHD density jump. In the strong field limit and for parallel shocks, the departure caused by the field saturates at a finite, negative, value. For perpendicular shocks, the departure goes to zero at small and high σ's so that we find here a departure window. The results obtained have to be checked against full 3D simulations.

title: Computational General Relativistic Force-Free Electrodynamics: II. Characterization of Numerical Diffusivity
authors: J. F. Mahlmann, M. A. Aloy, V. Mewes, P. Cerdá-Durán
topic: Scientific codes are an indispensable link between theory and experiment; in (astro-)plasma physics, such numerical tools are one window into the universe's most extreme flows of energy. The discretization of Maxwell's equations - needed to make highly magnetized (astro)physical plasma amenable to its numerical modeling - introduces numerical diffusion. It acts as a source of dissipation independent of the system's physical constituents. Understanding the numerical diffusion of scientific codes is the key to classify their reliability. It gives specific limits in which the results of numerical experiments are physical. We aim at quantifying and characterizing the numerical diffusion properties of our recently developed numerical tool for the simulation of general relativistic force-free electrodynamics, by calibrating and comparing it with other strategies found in the literature. Our code correctly models smooth waves of highly magnetized plasma. We evaluate the limits of general relativistic force-free electrodynamics in the context of current sheets and tearing mode instabilities.

title: GW190425 and GW190814: Two candidate mergers of primordial black holes from the QCD epoch
authors: Sebastien Clesse, Juan Garcia-Bellido
topic: The two recent gravitational-wave events GW190425 and GW190814 from the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo have both a companion which is unexpected if originated from a neutron star or a stellar black hole, with masses: [1.6−2.5] Msun  and [2.5−2.7] Msun. The possibility that these objects are Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) is investigated. The known thermal history of the Universe predicts that the PBH formation is boosted at the time of the QCD transition, inducing a peak in their distribution at this particular mass scale, and a bump around 30−50 M⊙. We find that the merging rates inferred from GW190425 and GW190814 are consistent with PBH binaries formed by capture in dense halos or before matter-radiation equality.

topic: Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescopes (MAGIC) detected the gamma-ray afterglow of GRB 190114C, which can constrain microscopic parameters of the shock-heated plasma emitting non-thermal emission. Focusing on the early afterglow of this event, we numerically simulate the spectrum and multi-wavelength light curves with constant and wind-like circumstellar medium using a time-dependent code. Our results show that the electron acceleration timescale at the highest energies is likely shorter than 20 times the gyroperiod to reproduce the GeV gamma-ray flux and its spectral index reported by {\it Fermi}. This gives an interesting constraint on the acceleration efficiency for Weibel-mediated shocks.

topic: The observation of a compact object with a mass of 2.50−2.67Msun on August 14, 2019, by the LIGO Scientific and Virgo collaborations (LVC) has the potential to improve our understanding of the supranuclear equation of state. While the gravitational-wave analysis of the LVC suggests that GW190814 likely was a binary black hole system, the secondary component could also have been the heaviest neutron star observed to date. We use our previously derived nuclear-physics--multi-messenger astrophysics framework to address the nature of this object. Based on our findings, we determine GW190814 to be a binary black hole merger with a probability of greater 99.9\%.

Some of these are very similar to the challenges faced by many astronomers engaging in international collaboration, for example, data access policies, funding, theoretical and computational resources and workforce equity. Others, including, alerts, telescope coordination and target-of-opportunity implementation, are strongly linked to the time domain and are particularly challenging as we respond to transients.

title: Radial oscillations and gravitational wave echoes of strange stars in various equation of states
authors: Jyatsnasree Bora, Umananda Dev Goswami
topic: We study the radial oscillations of non-rotating strange stars and their characteristic echo frequencies for three Equation of States (EoSs), viz., MIT Bag model EoS, linear EoS and polytropic EoS. The frequencies of radial oscillations of these compact stars are computed for these EoSs. 22 lowest radial frequencies for each of these three EoSs have been computed. First, for each EoS, we have integrated Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations numerically to calculate the radial and pressure perturbations of strange stars. Next, the mass-radius relationships for these stars are obtained using these three EoSs. Then the radial frequencies of oscillations for these EoSs are calculated. Further, the characteristic gravitational wave echo frequencies and the repetition of echo frequencies of strange stars are computed for these EoSs. Our numerical results show that the radial frequencies and also echo frequencies vastly depend on the model and on the value of the model parameter.

title: Revisiting constraints on the maximum neutron star mass in light of GW190814
authors: Yeunhwan Lim, Anirban Bhattacharya, Jeremy W. Holt, Debdeep Pati
topic: We investigate the maximum neutron star mass based on constraints from low-energy nuclear physics, neutron star tidal deformabilities from GW170817, and simultaneous mass-radius measurements of PSR J0030+045 from NICER. Our prior distribution is based on a combination of nuclear modeling valid in the vicinity of normal nuclear densities together with the assumption of a maximally stiff equation of state at high densities. The transition density is treated as a model parameter with uniform prior. Bayesian likelihood functions involving measured neutron star tidal deformabilities and radii are subsequently used to generate equation of state posteriors. We demonstrate that a modification of the highly uncertain supra-saturation density equation of state allows for the support of 2.5−2.6Msun neutron stars without strongly modifying the properties

title: Beyond moments: relativistic Lattice-Boltzmann methods for radiative transport in computational astrophysics
authors: L. R. Weih, A. Gabbana, D. Simeoni, L. Rezzolla, S. Succi, R. Tripiccione
topic: We present a new method for the numerical solution of the radiative-transfer equation (RTE) in multidimensional scenarios commonly encountered in computational astrophysics. The method is based on the direct solution of the Boltzmann equation via an extension of the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods and allows to model the evolution of the radiation field as it interacts with a background fluid, via absorption, emission, and scattering. As a first application of this method, we restrict our attention to a frequency independent (``grey'') formulation within a special-relativistic framework, which can be employed also for classical computational astrophysics. For a number of standard tests that consider the performance of the method in optically thin, optically thick and intermediate regimes with a static fluid, we show the ability of the LB method to produce accurate and convergent results matching the analytic solutions.

title: GW190814: Spin and equation of state of a neutron star companion
authors: Antonios Tsokaros, Milton Ruiz, Stuart L. Shapiro
topic: Here we explore some consequences of the assumption that the secondary was a neutron star (NS). We show with concrete examples of heretofore viable equations of state (EOSs) that rapid uniform rotation is certainly adequate to explain the existence of a stable ∼2.6Msun NS for moderately stiff EOS but may not be adequate for soft EOSs. Moreover, rotation may not even be necessary for sufficiently stiff ones. In particular, several soft EOSs favored by GW170817 and with maximum spherical masses of ∼2.1Msun \textit{cannot} be invoked to explain this object as a uniformly rotating NS. Absolute upper mass limits on the maximum spherical NS derived from GW170817 immediately suggest that this unknown compact companion can be a slowly or even a nonrotating NS. Stiff EOSs that can achieve this are neither rejected nor favored by GW170817, and they are in accord with the results of NICER.

We study the temporal and angular variations of the neutrino signals and discuss the detectability of the time variations driven by the spiral Standing Accretion Shock Instability (spiral SASI) when it emerges for non-exploding models.

This signal has the best localisation of any observed gravitational wave (GW) source. and an estimated distance of ~ 240 Mpc.

We use our optical and near-infrared limits in conjunction with the upper limits obtained by the community to constrain the possible electromagnetic counterparts associated with the merger. A gamma-ray burst seen along its jet's axis is disfavoured by the multi-wavelength dataset, whereas the presence of a burst seen at larger viewing angles is not well constrained.

topic: Because of the development of many-body theories of nuclear matter, the long-standing, open problem of the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter may be understood in the near future through the confrontation of theoretical calculations with laboratory measurements of nuclear properties \& reactions and increasingly accurate observations in astronomy. In this review, we focus on the following six aspects: 1) providing a survey of the quark mean-field (QMF) model, which consistently describes a nucleon and many-body nucleonic system from a quark potential; 2) applying QMF to both nuclear matter and neutron stars; 3) extending QMF formalism to the description of hypernuclei and hyperon matter, as well as hyperon stars; 4) exploring the hadron-quark phase transition and hybrid stars by combining the QMF model with the quark matter model characterized by the sound speed; 5) constraining interquark interactions through both the gravitational wave signals and electromagnetic signals of binary merger event GW170817; and 6) discussing further opportunities to study dense matter EOS from compact objects, such as neutron star cooling and pulsar glitches.

After presenting results of this algorithm in simple fields and comparing them to expected exact analytical solutions, we present new simulations for a rotating magnetic dipole in vacuum for a millisecond pulsar by using Deutsch solution. Particles are injected within the magnetosphere, neglecting radiation reaction, interaction among them and their feedback on the fields. Our simulations are therefore not yet fully self-consistent because Maxwell equations are not solved according to the current produced by these particles. The code highlights the symmetrical behaviour of particles of opposite charge to mass ratio q/m with respect to the north and south hemispheres.

title: The Role of Magnetic Fields in Neutrino-Driven Supernovae
authors: Bernhard Müller, Vishnu Varma
topic: We study the impact of a small-scale dynamo in core-collapse supernovae using a 3D neutrino magnetohydrodynamics simulation of a 15Msun progenitor. The weak seed field is amplified exponentially in the gain region once neutrino-driven convection develops, and remains dominated by small-scale structures. About 250ms after bounce, the field energy in the gain region reaches ~50\% of kinetic equipartition. This supports the development of a neutrino-driven explosion with modest global anisotropy, which does not occur in a corresponding model without magnetic fields. Our results suggest that magnetic fields may play a beneficial subsidiary role in neutrino-driven supernovae even without rapid progenitor rotation. Further investigation into the nature of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the supernova core is required.

authors: Taylor Jacovich, Paz Beniamini, Alexander van der Horst
topic: We present a self-consistent way of modeling synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) effects in gamma-ray burst afterglows, with and without approximated Klein-Nishina suppressed scattering. We provide an analytic approximation of our results, so that it can be incorporated into the afterglow modeling code \texttt{boxfit}, which is currently based on pure synchrotron emission. We discuss the changes in spectral shape and evolution due to SSC effects, and comment on how these changes affect physical parameters derived from broadband modeling. We show that SSC effects can have a profound impact on the shape of the X-ray light curve using simulations including these effects. This leads to data that cannot be simultaneously fit well in both the X-ray and radio bands when considering synchrotron-only fits, and an inability to recover the correct physical parameters, with some fitted parameters deviating orders of magnitude from the simulated input parameters. This may have a significant impact on the physical parameter distributions based on previous broadband modeling efforts.

title: Analyzing clustering of astrophysical gravitational-wave sources: Luminosity-distance space distortions
authors: Toshiya Namikawa
topic: We present a formulation of the observed number density fluctuations of gravitational-wave (GW) sources in a three dimensional space. In GW observations, redshift identification for each GW source is a challenging issue, in particular, for high redshift sources. The use of observed luminosity distance as a distance indicator will be a simple yet optimal way for measuring the clustering signal. We derive the density fluctuations of GW sources estimated from observed luminosity distance and sky position of each source. The density fluctuations are distorted as similar to the so-called redshift space distortions in galaxy surveys but with several differences. We then show the two-point correlation function and multipole power spectrum in the presence of the distortion effect.

However, observations of late-time electromagnetic emission are in tension with the expectations from standard neutron-star merger models. Although the large measured ejecta mass is potentially explained by a progenitor system that is asymmetric in terms of the stellar component masses, i.e. with a mass ratio q of 0.7-0.8, the known Galactic population of merging double neutron star (DNS) systems (i.e. those that will coalesce within billions of years or less) has, until now, only consisted of nearly equal-mass (q>0.9) binaries.

title: Is GW170817 a Multimessenger Neutron Star-Primordial Black Hole Merger?
authors: Yu-Dai Tsai, Antonella Palmese, Stefano Profumo, Tesla Jeltema
topic: We investigate the possibility of the gravitational-wave event GW170817 being a light, solar-mass black hole (BH) - neutron star (NS) merger. We explore two exotic scenarios involving primordial black holes (PBH) that could produce such an event, taking into account available observational information on NGC 4993. First, we entertain the possibility of dynamical NS-PBH binary formation where a solar-mass PBH and a NS form a binary through gravitational interaction. We find that while dynamical NS-PBH formation could account for the GW170817 event, the rate is highly dependent on unknown density contrast factors and could potentially be affected by galaxy mergers.

title: GW190814: Impact of a 2.6 solar mass neutron star on nucleonic equations of state
authors: F.J. Fattoyev, C.J. Horowitz, J. Piekarewicz, Brendan Reed
topic:Is the secondary component of GW190814 the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system? This is the central question animating this letter. Covariant density functional theory provides a unique framework to investigate both the properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars, while enforcing causality at all densities. By tuning existing energy density functionals we were able to: (a) account for a 2.6 Msun neutron star, (b) satisfy the original constraint on the tidal deformability of a 1.4 Msun neutron star, and (c) reproduce ground-state properties of finite nuclei.

title: Search for gravitational waves from high-mass-ratio compact-binary mergers of stellar mass and sub-solar mass black holes

topic: We present the first search for gravitational waves from the coalescence of stellar mass and sub-solar mass black holes with masses between 20−100 Msun and 0.01−1 Msun (10 - 10^3 MJ), respectively. The observation of a single sub-solar mass black hole would establish the existence of primordial black holes and a possible component of dark matter. We search the ∼164 days of public LIGO data from 2015-2017 when LIGO-Hanford and LIGO-Livingston were simultaneously observing. We find no significant candidate gravitational-wave signals.

topic: The late inspiral is influenced by the presence of tides, which depend on the neutron star equation of state. Neutron star mergers are expected to often produce rapidly-rotating remnant neutron stars that emit gravitational waves. These will provide clues to the extremely hot post-merger environment. This signature of nuclear matter in gravitational waves contains most information in the 2-4 kHz frequency band, which is outside of the most sensitive band of current detectors. We present the design concept and science case for a neutron star extreme matter observatory (NEMO): a gravitational-wave interferometer optimized to study nuclear physics with merging neutron stars.

title: Search for high energy gamma-rays from the direction of the candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger gravitational-wave event S190521g
authors: Egor Podlesnyi, Timur Dzhatdoev
topic: The gravitational-wave event S190521g -- a likely binary black hole merger in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus -- was accompanied by an optical counterpart. Such dense environments around luminous energy release regions are favourable for high energy gamma-ray production. We report on a search for high energy gamma-rays from the direction of the candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the S190521g event using publicly-available data of the Fermi-LAT space gamma-ray telescope. No significant signal was found. We present upper limits on the spectral energy distribution of the source in the 100 MeV -- 300 GeV energy range. We discuss the importance of studying S190521g-like transients in the context of cosmic ray acceleration, gamma-ray and neutrino production in such sources.

title: RAPTOR II: Polarized radiative transfer in curved spacetime
authors: Thomas Bronzwaer, Ziri Younsi, Jordy Davelaar, Heino Falcke
topic: Accreting supermassive black holes are sources of polarized radiation that propagates through highly curved spacetime before reaching the observer. In order to help interpret observations of such polarized emission, accurate and efficient numerical schemes for polarized radiative transfer in curved spacetime are needed. In this manuscript we extend our publicly available radiative transfer code RAPTOR to include polarization. We provide a brief review of different codes and methods for covariant polarized radiative transfer available in the literature and existing codes, and present an efficient new scheme. For the spacetime-propagation aspect of the computation, we develop a compact, Lorentz-invariant representation of a polarized ray. For the plasma-propagation aspect of the computation, we perform a formal analysis of the stiffness of the polarized radiative-transfer equation with respect to our explicit integrator, and develop a hybrid integration scheme that switches to an implicit integrator in case of stiffness, in order to solve the equation with optimal speed and accuracy for all possible values of the local optical/Faraday thickness of the plasma.

title: Why can hadronic stars convert into strange quark stars with larger radii
authors: Alessandro Drago, Giuseppe Pagliara
topic: The total binding energy of compact stars is the sum of the gravitational binding energy (BE)g and the nuclear binding energy (BE)n, the last being related to the microphysics of the interactions. While the first is positive (binding) both for hadronic stars and for strange quark stars, the second is large and negative for hadronic stars (anti-binding) and either small and negative (anti-binding) or positive (binding) for strange quark stars. A hadronic star can convert into a strange quark star with a larger radius because the consequent reduction of (BE)g is over-compensated by the large increase in (BE)n. Thus, the total binding energy increases due to the conversion and the process is exothermic.

title: Wind-powered afterglows of gamma-ray bursts: flares, plateaus and steep decays
authors: 
topic: Afterglows of gamma-ray bursts often show flares, plateaus, and sudden intensity drops: these temporal features are difficult to explain as coming from the forward shock. We calculate radiative properties of early GRB afterglows with the dominant contribution from the reverse shock (RS) propagating in an ultra-relativistic (pulsar-like) wind produced by the long-lasting central engine. RS emission occurs in the fast cooling regime - this ensures high radiative efficiency and allows fast intensity variations. We demonstrate that: (i) mild wind power, of the order of ∼1046 erg s−1, can reproduce the afterglows' plateau phase; (ii) termination of the wind can produce sudden steep decays; (iii) mild variations in the wind luminosity can produce short-duration afterglow flares.

title: Turbulent, pinned superfluids in neutron stars and pulsar glitch recoveries
authors: Brynmor Haskell, Danai Antonopoulou, Carlo Barenghi
topic: Pulsar glitches offer an insight into the dynamics of superfluids in the high density interior of a neutron star. To model these phenomena, however, one needs to have an understanding of the dynamics of a turbulent array of superfluid vortices moving through a pinning lattice. In this paper we develop a theoretical approach to describe vortex mediated mutual friction in a pinned, turbulent and rotating superfluid. Our model is then applied to the study of the post glitch rotational evolution in the Vela pulsar and in PSR J0537-6910. We show that in both cases a turbulent model fits the evolution of the spin frequency derivative better than a laminar one. We also predict that the second derivative of the frequency after a glitch should be correlated with the waiting time since the previous glitch, which we find to be consistent with observational data for these pulsars. The main conclusion of this paper is that in the post-glitch rotational evolution of these two pulsars we are most likely observing the response to the glitch of a pinned turbulent region of the star (possibly the crust) and not the laminar response of a regular straight vortex array.

title: The mass, spin and rotational energy of the remnant black holes from compact binary mergers
authors: Can-Min Deng
topic: Recently, many gravitational wave events from compact binary mergers have been detected by LIGO. Determining the final mass and spin of the remnant black holes (RBHs) is a fundamental issue and is also important in astrophysics. In this paper, unified models for predicting the final mass and spin of the RBHs from compact binary mergers is proposed. The models achieve a good accuracy within the parameter range of interest. In addition, the rotational energy of the RBHs is also studied which is relevant to the electromagnetic counterparts of the mergers. It is found the distribution of the rotational energy of the RBHs from different types of mergers of compact binary has its own characteristics, which might help identify the electromagnetic counterparts associated with the mergers.

authors: Nai-Bo Zhang, Bao-An Li
topic: Using Stergioulas's RNS code for investigating fast pulsars with Equation of States (EOSs) on the causality surface (where the speed of sound equals to that of light) of the high-density EOS parameter space satisfying all known constraints from both nuclear physics and astrophysics, we show that the GW190814's secondary component of mass (2.50−2.67) Msun can be a super-fast pulsar spinning faster than 971 Hz about 42\% below its Kepler frequency. There is a large and physically allowed EOS parameter space below the causality surface where pulsars heavier than 2.50 Msun are supported if they can rotate even faster with critical frequencies depending strongly on the high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy.

title: Nickel clumps and light curve bumps: Light curves and spectra of models with macroscopic 56Ni clumps in the outer ejecta
authors: M. R. Magee, K. Maguire
topic: An excess of flux in the early light curves of type Ia supernovae has been observed in a few cases. Multiple scenarios have been proposed to explain this. Recently, it has been shown that for at least one object (SN 2018oh) the excess emission observed could be the result of a large-scale clump of 56Ni in the outer ejecta of ~0.03 Msun. We present model light curves and spectra for ejecta profiles containing 56Ni clumps of varying masses (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 Msun) and shapes. We find that even for our lowest mass 56Ni clump, an increase of less of eq 2 magnitudes is produced in the bolometric light curve at one day after explosion, relative to models without a 56Ni clump.

Making use of existing experimental nuclear data, we estimate the maximum possible amount of heat that can be deposited in the outer crust of an accreting neutron star due to electron captures and pycnonuclear fusion reactions triggered by the burial of X-ray burst ashes.

authors: Denis Nikolaevich Sob'yanin 
topic: We show that consideration of forced precession of a neutron star does not encounter the difficulty. This kind of precession takes place even if the neutron star is not deformed and is brought about by the anomalous moment of electromagnetic forces induced by stellar rotation and determined by non-corotational currents. Contrary to what is expected for the currents of corotation, the anomalous torque calculated by the direct method appears to be non-zero.

title: Discriminating between Neutron Stars and Black Holes with Imperfect Knowledge of the Maximum Neutron Star Mass
authors: Reed Essick, Philipe Landry
topic: Constructing an explicit mixture model for the total rate density of merging compact objects, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian analysis to classify gravitational-wave sources according to the posterior odds that their component masses are drawn from different subpopulations. Accounting for current uncertainty in the maximum neutron star mass, and adopting different reasonable models for the total rate density, we examine two recent events from the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration's third observing run, GW190425 and GW190814. For population models with no overlap between the neutron star and black hole mass distributions, we typically find that there is a more or equal 70 \% chance that GW190425 was a binary neutron star merger rather than a neutron-star--black-hole merger.

authors: Hou-Jun Lü, Yong Yuan, Lin Lan, Bin-Bin Zhang, Jin-Hang Zou, Zong-Kai Peng, Jun Shen, Yun-Feng Liang, Xiang-Gao Wang, En-Wei Liang
topic: Together with the EE component and early X-ray data, it exhibits a plateau emission smoothly connected with a \sim t^-1 segment, and followed by an extremely steep decay. The short GRB composed of those three segments is unique in the {\em Swift} era, and is very difficult to explain with the standard internal/external shock model of a black hole central engine, but could be consistent with the prediction of a magnetar central engine from the merger of an NS binary. We suggest that the plateau emission followed by a \sim t^-1 decay phase is powered by the spin-down of millisecond magnetar, which loses its rotation energy via GW quadrupole radiation. Then, the abrupt drop decay is caused by magnetar collapsing into black hole before switching to the EM-dominated emission.

title: Two temperature solutions and emergent spectra from relativistic accretion discs around black holes
authors: Shilpa Sarkar, Indranil Chattopadhyay, Philippe Laurent
topic: An accreting system in two-temperature regime, admits multiple solutions for the same set of constants of motion, producing widely different spectra. Comparing observed spectrum with that derived from a randomly chosen accretion solution, will give us a wrong estimation of the accretion parameters of the system. The form of entropy measure obtained by us, have helped in removing the degeneracy of the solutions, allowing us to understand the physics of the system, shorn of arbitrary assumptions. In this work, we have shown how the spectra and luminosities of an accreting system depends on the constants of motion, producing solutions ranging from radiatively inefficient flows to luminous flows. Increase in BH mass quantitatively changes the system, makes the system more luminous and the spectral bandwidth also increases. Higher BH mass system spans from radio to gamma-rays. However, increasing the accretion rate around a BH of certain mass, has little influence in the frequency range of the spectra.

In this data release, we propose a new delineation between the r-I and r-II stellar classes. Redefining the separation between r-I and r-II stars will aid in analysis of the possible progenitors of these two classes of stars and whether these signatures arise from separate astrophysical sources at all. Applying this redefinition to previous RPA data, the number of identified r-II and r-I stars changes to 51 and 121, respectively, from the initial set of data releases published thus far.

title: FIRST J1419+3940 as the First Observed Radio Flare from a Neutron Star Merger
authors: K.H. Lee, I. Bartos, G.C. Privon, J.C. Rose, P. Torrey
topic: During their violent merger, two neutron stars can shed a few percent of their mass. As this ejecta expands, it collides with the surrounding interstellar gas, producing a slowly-fading {\it radio flare} that lasts for years. Radio flares uniquely probe the neutron star merger populations as many events from past decades could still be detectable. Nonetheless, no radio flare observation has been reported to date. Here we show that the radio transient FIRST J1419+3940, first observed in 1993 and still detectable, likely originated from a neutron star merger. We carry out numerical simulations of neutron star merger ejecta to demonstrate that the observed radio light curve is well reproduced by a merger model with astrophysically expected parameters. We find that a neutron star merger model is a priori more likely and provides a better fit to the data than the alternative explanation---the afterglow of an off-axis long gamma-ray burst.

title: Post-merger Mass Ejection of Low-mass Binary Neutron Stars
authors: Sho Fujibayashi, Shinya Wanajo, Kenta Kiuchi, Koutaro Kyutoku, Yuichiro Sekiguchi, Masaru Shibata
topic: We study the post-merger mass ejection of low-mass binary neutron stars (NSs) with the system mass of 2.5M⊙, and subsequent nucleosynthesis by performing general-relativistic, neutrino-radiation viscous-hydrodynamics simulations in axial symmetry. We find that the merger remnants are long-lived massive NSs surviving more than several seconds, irrespective of the nuclear equations of state (EOSs) adopted.  Post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations indicate that the ejecta is composed mainly of light r-process nuclei with small amounts of lanthanides. Such abundance distributions are incompatible with the solar r-process-like abundance patterns found in all measured r-process-enhanced metal-poor stars. Therefore, low-mass binary NS mergers should be rare. If such low-mass NS mergers occur, their electromagnetic counterparts, kilonovae, will be characterized by an early bright blue emission because of the large ejecta mass as well as the small lanthanide fraction. We also show, however, that if the effective turbulent viscosity is very high, or there is an efficient mass ejection working in the early post-merger phase, the electron fraction of the ejecta could be low enough that the solar r-process-like abundance pattern is reproduced and the lanthanide fraction becomes so high that the kilonova would be characterized by early bright blue and late bright red emissions.

authors: Shabnam Iyyani, Vidushi Sharma
topic: The prompt emission of short gamma ray bursts (sGRBs) with known redshifts are analyzed using the model of multi-color blackbody which is interpreted as the emission from a non-dissipative photosphere taking into account the structure and the viewing geometry of the jet. We find nearly 69% and 26% of the sample are consistent with multi-color blackbody and a pure blackbody model, respectively. We find that nearly 57\%(18\%) of the sGRBs in our sample are observed within (or along the edge of) the jet cone. The sGRB jets are found to be very narrow with the most probable value of the jet opening angle, θj=2pm1 deg. This gives the rate of sGRBs that would be viewed within the jet cone to be 0.2−4.4Gpc−3yr−1. The intrinsic luminosity are found to range between 1048−1053erg/s. The average values of Lorentz factor and nozzle radius of the sGRB jets are found to be 210(85) and 107.7(109.6)cm for the cases when the photosphere forms in the coasting (accelerating) phase respectively.

title: Revisiting primordial black holes capture into neutron stars
authors: Yoann Génolini, Pasquale Serpico, Peter Tinyakov
topic: Primordial black holes (PBH), produced through a variety of processes in the early universe, could fill galactic halos accounting for a fraction or the totality of the dark matter. In particular, PBH with sub-stellar masses could be captured by stars, start to swallow their material, and eventually turn them into BH, hence originating a peculiar new type of stellar catastrophic event. Here we revisit this process in the most favorable case of PBH capture by neutron stars. We detail a number of novel features in the capture phase, during the settling within the star and mass growth of the PBH, and illustrate some phenomenological consequences. In particular, we point out that in the subsonic regime the PBH drag takes the form of a Bondi accretion.

title: A systematic study on the rise time-peak luminosity relation for bright optical transients powered by wind shock breakout
authors: Akihiro Suzuki, Takashi J. Moriya, Tomoya Takiwaki
topic: A number of astrophyical transients originating from stellar explosions are powered by the collision of the ejected material with the circumstellar medium, which efficiently produces thermal radiation via shock dissipation. We investigate how such interaction-powered transients are distributed in the peak bolometric luminosity vs the rise time phase space. Taking the advantage of less time-consuming one-dimensional simulations with spherical symmetry, we calculated more than 500 models with different circumstellar mass and radius, ejecta mass and energy, and chemical compositions. The peak bolometric luminosity, the total radiated energy, and the rise time of the interaction-powered emission are measured for each simulated light curve. We consider how these characteristic quantities are determined as a function of the model parameters and discuss possible implications for the observed populations of (potential) interaction-powered transients, such as type IIn supernovae and fast blue optical transients.

topic: The observation of gravitational waves from an asymmetric binary opens the possibility for heavy neutron stars, but these pose challenges to models of the neutron star equation of state. We construct heavy neutron stars by introducing non-trivial structure in the speed of sound sourced by deconfined QCD matter, which cannot be well recovered by spectral representations. Their moment of inertia, Love number and quadrupole moment are very small, so a tenfold increase in sensitivity may be needed to test this possibility with gravitational waves, which is feasible with third generation detectors.

title: Photospheric Emission in Gamma-ray Bursts: Variability
authors: Kai Wang, Da-Bin Lin, Yun Wang, Lu-yao Jiang, Shen-Shi Du, Xiao-Yan Li, Jia Ren, Xiang-gao Wang, En-Wei Liang
topic: It is generally believed that the variability of photospheric emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) traces that of the jet power. This work further investigates the variability of photospheric emission in a variable jet. By setting a constant η (dimensionless entropy of the jet), we find that the light curve of the photospheric emission shows a ``tracking'' pattern on the time profile of jet power. However, the relative variability is significantly low in the photospheric emission compared with that in the jet power. If the η is genetic variable, the variability of the photospheric emission is not only limited by the jet power but also affected by η strongly. It becomes complex and is generally different from that of the jet power. Moreover, the opposite phase may stand in the variabilities of the photospheric emission at different photon energies. We also find that the relative variability does not remain constant over the photon energies with an obvious reduction at a certain energy.

We identify these oscillations as superluminal longitudinal waves in the pulsar plasma, and point out that these waves can escape directly in the O-mode. Escape of the energy in these oscillations is possible only if they are generated in overdense, field-aligned regions that we call fibers; the wave energy is initially refracted into underdense regions between the fibers, which act as ducts. Some implications of the model for the interpretation of pulsar radio emission are discussed.

authors: Jirong Mao, Liande Li, Jiancheng Wang
topic: We statistically examine the gamma-ray burst (GRB) photon indices obtained by the Fermi-GBM and Fermi-LAT observations and compare the LAT GRB photon indices to the GBM GRB photon indices. We apply the jitter radiation to explain the GRB spectral diversities in the high-energy bands. In our model, the jitter radiative spectral index is determined by the spectral index of the turbulence.

title: Recent Progress on Particle Acceleration and Reconnection Physics during Magnetic Reconnectionin the Magnetically-dominated Relativistic Regime
authors: Fan Guo, Yi-Hsin Liu, Xiaocan Li, Hui Li, William Daughton, Patrick Kilian
topic: Magnetic reconnection in strongly magnetized astrophysical plasma environments is believed to be the primary process for fast energy release and particle energization. Currently there is strong interest in relativistic magnetic reconnection, in that it may provide a new explanation for high-energy particle acceleration and radiation in strongly magnetized astrophysical systems. We review recent advances in particle acceleration and reconnection physics in the magnetically-dominated regime. More discussion is focused on the physics of particle acceleration, power-law formation as well as the reconnection rate problem. In addition, we provide an outlook for studying reconnection acceleration mechanisms and kinetic physics in the next step.

title: CMacIonize 2.0: a novel task-based approach to Monte Carlo radiation transfer
authors: Bert Vandenbroucke, Peter Camps
topic: In this work, we present a novel approach to MCRT that addresses the challenging memory access patterns of traditional MCRT algorithms, which hinder optimal performance of MCRT simulations on modern hardware with a complex memory architecture. (Methods) We reformulate the MCRT photon packet life cycle as a task-based algorithm, whereby the computation is broken down into small tasks that are executed concurrently. Photon packets are stored in intermediate buffers, and tasks propagate photon packets through small parts of the computational domain, moving them from one buffer to another in the process. Using the implementation of the new algorithm in the photoionization MCRT code CMacIonize 2.0, we show that the decomposition of the MCRT grid into small parts leads to a significant performance gain during the photon packet propagation phase, which constitutes the bulk of an MCRT algorithm, as a result of better usage of memory caches.

title: On dynamics of nonmagnetic accretion disks
authors: V. S. Borisov
topic: Axisymmetric accretion disks in vicinity of a central compact body are studied. In the case of non-viscous disk it is proven that all solutions for the midplane circular velocity are unstable. Hence, the pure hydrodynamic turbulence in accretion disks is possible. It is disproved the well-known arguments that an inviscid accretion disk must be sub-Keplerian. It is also demonstrated that the regular asymptotic solutions, often used in astrophysics, can lead to erroneous conclusions. It is proven that a laminar viscous disk can be approximated with a great precision by the vortex motion. Assuming that a turbulent gas tends to flow with minimal losses, we have shown that a turbulent disk tends to be Keplerian.

title: Constraints from GW170817 on the bulk viscosity of neutron star matter and the r-mode instability
authors: T. R. Routray, S. P. Pattnaik, C. Gonzalez-Boquera, X. Viñas, M. Centelles, B. Behera
topic: We perform a systematic study of the dependence of the r-mode phenomenology in normal fluid pulsar neutron stars on the symmetry energy slope parameter L. An essential ingredient in this study is the bulk viscosity, which is evaluated consistently for several equations of state corresponding to different values of the slope parameter L. Direct Urca processes, which are allowed from a critical L-value onwards, enhance the bulk viscosity and have large influence on the r-mode features, such as the instability boundary and spin-down properties of newborn neutron stars. The magnitude of the changes in the r-mode properties induced by the direct Urca processes are driven by the L-value of the equation of state and the mass of the pulsar.

authors: A. Y. Potekhin, D. A. Zyuzin, D. G. Yakovlev, M. V. Beznogov, Yu. A. Shibanov
topic: Ages and thermal luminosities of neutron stars, inferred from observations, can be interpreted with the aid of the neutron star cooling theory to gain information on the properties of superdense matter in neutron-star interiors. We present a survey of estimated ages, surface temperatures and thermal luminosities of middle-aged neutron stars with relatively weak or moderately strong magnetic fields, which can be useful for these purposes. The catalogue includes results selected from the literature, supplemented with new results of spectral analysis of a few cooling neutron stars. The data are compared with the theory. We show that overall agreement of theoretical cooling curves with observations improves substantially for models where neutron superfluidity in stellar core is weak.

title: Kink-driven magnetic reconnection in relativistic jets: consequences for X-ray polarimetry of BL Lacs
authors: Gianluigi Bodo, Fabrizo Tavecchio, Lorenzo Sironi
topic: We investigate with relativistic MHD simulations the dissipation physics of BL Lac jets, by studying the synchrotron polarization signatures of particles accelerated by the kink instability in a magnetically-dominated plasma column. The nonlinear stage of the kink instability generates current sheets, where particles can be efficiently accelerated via magnetic reconnection. We identify current sheets as regions where s = J d/B is above some predefined threshold (where B is the field strength, J the current density and d the grid scale), and assume that the particle injection efficiency scales as proportional to the square of the current. X-ray emitting particles have short cooling times, so they only probe the field geometry of their injection sites. In contrast, particles emitting in the optical band, which we follow self-consistently as they propagate away from their injection sites while cooling, sample a larger volume, and so they may be expected to produce different polarimetric signatures.

title: Parameter estimation for strong phase transitions in supranuclear matter using gravitational-wave astronomy
authors: Peter T. H. Pang, Tim Dietrich, Ingo Tews, Chris Van Den Broeck
topic: At supranuclear densities, explored in the core of neutron stars, a strong phase transition from hadronic matter to more exotic forms of matter might be present. To test this hypothesis, binary neutron-star mergers offer a unique possibility to probe matter at densities that we can not create in any existing terrestrial experiment. In this work, we show that, if present, strong phase transitions can have a measurable imprint on the binary neutron-star coalescence and the emitted gravitational-wave signal. We construct a new parameterization of the supranuclear equation of state that allows us to test for the existence of a strong phase transition and extract its characteristic properties purely from the gravitational-wave signal of the inspiraling neutron stars.

authors: Elias R. Most, L. Jens Papenfort, Lukas R. Weih, Luciano Rezzolla
topic: While the primary was most likely a black hole, the secondary could be interpreted as either the lightest black hole or the most massive neutron star ever observed, but also as the indication of a novel class of exotic compact objects. We here argue that the secondary in GW190814 needs not be an ab-initio black hole nor an exotic object; rather, based on our current understanding of the nuclear-matter equation of state, it can be a rapidly rotating neutron star that collapsed to a rotating black hole at some point before merger. Show it using EOS.

topic: We scrutinize the paradigm that conventional long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the dominant source of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) within the internal shock scenario by describing UHECR spectrum and composition and by studying the predicted (source and cosmogenic) neutrino fluxes. Since it has been demonstrated that the stacking searches for astrophysical GRB neutrinos strongly constrain the parameter space in single-zone models, we focus on the dynamics of multiple collisions for which different messengers are expected to come from different regions of the same object. We propose a model which can describe both stochastic and deterministic engines, which we study in a systematic way.

title: Monte-Carlo simulations of fast Newtonian and mildly relativistic shock breakout from a stellar wind
authors: Hirotaka Ito, Amir Levinson, Ehud Nakar
topic: Strong explosion of a compact star surrounded by a thick stellar wind drives a fast (greater 0.1c) radiation mediated shock (RMS) that propagates in the wind, and ultimately breaks out gradually once photons start escaping from the shock transition layer. In exceptionally strong or aspherical explosions the shock velocity may even be relativistic. The properties of the breakout signal depend on the dynamics and structure of the shock during the breakout phase. Here we present, for the first time, spectra and lightcurves of the breakout emission of fast Newtonian and mildly relativistic shocks, that were calculated using self-consistent Monte-Carlo simulations of finite RMS with radiative losses.

title: Nuclear Reaction Screening, Weak Interactions, and r-Process Nucleosynthesis in High Magnetic Fields
authors: Michael Famiano, A. Baha Balantekin, Toshitaka Kajino, Motohiko Kusakabe, Kanji Mori, Yudong Luo
topic: Coulomb screening and weak interactions in a hot, magnetized plasma are investigated. Coulomb screening is evaluated in a relativistic thermal plasma in which electrons and positrons are in equilibrium. In addition to temperature effects, effects on weak screening from a strong external magnetic field are evaluated. In high fields, the electron transverse momentum components are quantized into Landau levels. The characteristic plasma screening length at high temperatures and at high magnetic fields is explored. In addition to changes to the screening length, changes in weak interaction rates are estimated. It is found that high fields can result in increased β-decay rates as the electron and positron spectra are dominated by Landau levels. Finally, the effects studied here are evaluated in a simple r-process model. It is found that relativistic Coulomb screening has a small effect on the final abundance distribution. While changes in weak interaction rates in strong magnetic fields can have an effect on the r-process evolution and abundance distribution, the field strength required to have a significant effect may be larger than what is currently thought to be typical of the r-process environment in collapsar jets or neutron star mergers.

authors: M. J. Graham, K. E. S. Ford, B. McKernan, N. P. Ross, D. Stern, K. Burdge, M. Coughlin, S. G. Djorgovski, A. J. Drake et al
topic: We report the first plausible optical electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to a (candidate) binary black hole (BBH) merger. Detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), the EM flare is consistent with expectations for a kicked BBH merger in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), and is unlikely due to intrinsic variability of this source. The lack of color evolution implies that it is not a supernovae and instead is strongly suggestive of a constant temperature shock. Other false-positive events, such as microlensing or a tidal disruption event, are ruled out or constrained.

topic: We report the discovery and panchromatic followup observations of the young Type Ic supernova, SN2020oi, in M100, a grand design spiral galaxy at a mere distance of 14 Mpc. We followed up with observations at radio, X-ray and optical wavelengths from only a few days to several months after explosion. The optical behaviour of the supernova is similar to those of other normal Type Ic supernovae. Given, the relatively small number of stripped envelope SNe for which radio emission is detectable, we used this opportunity to perform a detailed analysis of the comprehensive radio dataset we obtained. The radio emitting electrons initially experience a phase of inverse Compton cooling which leads to steepening of the spectral index of the radio emission.

authors: Ruiyu Zhou, Ligong Bian
topic: Cosmic strings and first-order phase transition are two main sources for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we study the stochastic gravitational wave radiation from cosmic string which is formed after the first-order phase transition. For the first-order phase transition occurs at temperature far beyond the electroweak scale, the gravitational wave signal cannot be reached by the future gravitational wave interferometers. The gravitational waves from cosmic strings that formed after the phase transition can be detected by future gravitational wave detectors in a wide range of frequency, and therefore its imprints can serve to search for firs-order phase transitions at high scales with the phase transition temperature:

title: Two-fluid simulations of the magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores in the weak-coupling regime
authors: F. Castillo, A. Reisenegger, J. A. Valdivia
topic: In a previous paper, we reported simulations of the evolution of the magnetic field in neutron star cores through ambipolar diffusion, taking the neutrons as a motionless uniform background. However, in real neutron stars, neutrons are free to move, and a strong composition gradient leads to stable stratification (stability against convective motions) both of which might impact on the time-scales of evolution. Here we address these issues by providing the first long-term two-fluid simulations of the evolution of an axially symmetric magnetic field in a neutron star core composed of neutrons, protons, and electrons with density and composition gradients. However, the evolution is found to be faster than in the case of motionless neutrons, as the movement of charged particles (which are coupled to the magnetic field, but are also limited by the collisional drag forces exerted by neutrons) is less constrained, since neutrons are now allowed to move. The possible impact of non-axisymmetric instabilities on these equilibria, as well as beta decays, proton superconductivity, and neutron superfluidity, are left for future work.

authors: Axel Brandenburg
topic: The ohmic decay of magnetic fields in the crusts of neutron stars is generally believed to be governed by Hall drift which leads to what is known as a Hall cascade. Here we show that helical and fractionally helical magnetic fields undergo strong inverse cascading like in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but the magnetic energy decays much more slowly Even for a nonhelical magnetic field there is inverse cascading with an increase of magnetic energy at the largest possible scale in the system. The strength of this effect depends on the strength of the magnetic field and disappears for weak fields.

topic: We report the observation of a compact binary coalescence involving a 22.2 - 24.3 Msun black hole and a compact object with a mass of 2.50 - 2.67 Msun (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The gravitational-wave signal, GW190814, was observed during LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run on August 14, 2019 at 21:10:39 UTC and has a signal-to-noise ratio of 25 in the three-detector network. The source was localized to 18.5 deg2 at a distance of 241+41−45 Mpc; no electromagnetic counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most unequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational waves, 0.112+0.008−0.009, and its secondary component is either the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system. The dimensionless spin of the primary black hole is tightly constrained to less or eqyal 0.07. Tests of general relativity reveal no measurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole emission is confirmed at high confidence.

topic: In the modern era of abundant X-ray detections and the increasing momentum of gravitational waves astronomy, tests of General Relativity in strong field regime become increasingly feasible and their importance for probing gravity cannot be understated. To this end, we study the characteristics of slowly rotating topological neutron stars in the tensor-multi-scalar theories of gravity following the static study of this new type of compact objects by two of the authors. We explore the moment of inertia and verify that universal relations known from General Relativity hold for this new class of compact objects. Furthermore, we study the properties of their innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) and the epicyclic frequencies due to the latter's hinted link to observational quantities such as quasi-periodic X-ray spectrum features.

title: A Generalized Kompaneets Formalism for Inelastic Neutrino-Nucleon Scattering in Supernova Simulations
authors: Tianshu Wang, Adam Burrows
topic: Based on the Kompaneets approximation, we develop a robust methodology to calculate spectral redistribution via inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering in the context of core-collapse supernova simulations. The resulting equations conserve lepton number to machine precision and scale linearly, not quadratically, with number of energy groups. The formalism also provides an elegant means to derive the rate of energy transfer to matter which, as it must, automatically goes to zero when the neutrino radiation field is in thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we derive the next-higher-order in {\epsilon}/mc2 correction to the neutrino Kompaneets equation. Unlike other Kompaneets schema, ours also generalizes to the case of anisotropic angular distributions, while retaining the conservative form that is a hallmark of the classical Kompaneets equation. Our formalism enables immediate incorporation into supernova codes that follow the spectral angular moments of the neutrino radiation fields.

title: Testing the Weak Equivalence Principle and Lorentz Invariance with Multiwavelength Polarization Observations of GRB Optical Afterglows
authors: Jun-Jie Wei, Xue-Feng Wu
topic: Violations of both the weak equivalence principle (WEP) and Lorentz invariance can produce vacuum birefringence, which leads to an energy-dependent rotation of the polarization vector of linearly polarized emission from a given astrophysical source. However, the search for the birefringent effect has been hindered by our ignorance concerning the intrinsic polarization angle in different energy bands. Considering the contributions to the observed linear polarization angle from both the intrinsic polarization angle and the rotation angles induced by violations of the WEP and Lorentz invariance, and assuming the intrinsic polarization angle is an unknown constant, we simultaneously obtain robust bounds on possible deviations from the WEP and Lorentz invariance, by directly fitting the multiwavelength polarimetric data of the optical afterglows of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 020813 and GRB 021004.

authors: Zewei Xiong, Andre Sieverding, Manibrata Sen, Yong-Zhong Qian
topic: The wind driven by the intense neutrino emission from a protoneutron star (PNS) is an important site for producing nuclei heavier than the Fe group. Because of certain features in the neutrino angular distributions, the so-called fast flavor oscillations may occur very close to the PNS surface, effectively resetting the neutrino luminosities and energy spectra that drive the wind.
Using the unoscillated neutrino emission characteristics from two core-collapse supernova simulations representative of relevant progenitors at the lower and higher mass end, we study the potential effects of fast flavor oscillations on neutrino-driven winds and their nucleosynthesis.

title: Higher-order gravitational-wave modes will allow for percent-level measurements of Hubble's constant with single binary neutron star merger observations
authors: Juan Calderón Bustillo, Tim Dietrich, Paul D. Lasky
topic: The first multi-messenger gravitational-wave observation of a binary neutron star merger allowed for the first distance-ladder independent measure of Hubble's constant, albeit with an uncertainty of ∼15% at the 68\% credible level. We show that a single future observation of a binary neutron star merger with a network of detectors sensitive to the post-merger remnant at a few kHz, and commensurate improvement in cosmological redshift measurements, will allow for percent-level uncertainties in measurement of Hubble's constant. We show how higher-order modes can be exploited in astrophysical parameter estimation in both the inspiral phase, and also the post-merger remnant. While former suffices in the case of unequal-mass binaries to obtain major improvements in the distance estimates, the latter is crucial for equal-mass cases.

We conclude by comparing our nucleosynthesis results directly with stellar data for metal-poor stars rich in r-process elements to consider whether fission plays a role in the so-called `universality' of r-process abundances observed from star to star.

title: A brief overview of black hole-neutron star mergers
authors: Francois Foucart
topic: Of the three main types of binaries detectable through ground-based gravitational wave observations, black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers remain the most elusive. While candidates BHNS exist in the triggers released during the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO/Virgo collaboration, no detection has been confirmed so far. As for binary neutron star systems, BHNS binaries allow us to explore a wide range of physical processes, including the neutron star equation of state, nucleosynthesis, stellar evolution, high-energy astrophysics, and the expansion of the Universe. Here, we review some of the main features of BHNS systems: the distinction between disrupting and non-disrupting binaries, the types of outflows that BHNS mergers can produce, and the information that can be extracted from the observation of their gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals. We also emphasize that for the most likely binary parameters, BHNS mergers seem less likely to power electromagnetic signals than binary neutron star systems. Finally, we discuss some of the issues that still limit our ability to model and interpret electromagnetic signals from BHNS binaries.

authors: N. Fraija, T. Laskar, S. Dichiara, P. Beniamini, R. Barniol Duran, M.G. Dainotti, R. L. Becerra
topic: The Fermi-LAT collaboration presented the second gamma-ray burst (GRB) catalog covering its first 10 years of operations. A significant fraction of afterglow-phase light curves in this catalog cannot be explained by the closure relations of the standard synchrotron forward-shock model, suggesting that there could be an important contribution from another process. In view of the above, we derive the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) light curves from the reverse shock in the thick- and thin-shell regime for a uniform-density medium. We show that this emission could explain the GeV flares exhibited in some LAT light curves. Additionally, we demonstrate that the passage of the forward shock synchrotron cooling break through the LAT band from jets expanding in a uniform-density environment may be responsible for the late time

This method enables us to extract signals of rotation measures contributed by intervening gas around multiple galaxies. Our results show that there is no detectable correlation between the distribution of rotation measures and the number of foreground galaxies, contrary to several previous results. By adopting a column density distribution of ionized gas obtained from absorption line measurements, we further estimate the strengths of coherent magnetic fields parallel to the line of sight of less the equal 2 micro Gauss in the CGM.

title: General Relativistic Mean-field Dynamo Model for Proto-neutron Stars
authors: K. Franceschetti, L. Del Zanna
topic: Neutron stars, and magnetars in particular, are known to host the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe. The origin of these strong fields is a matter of controversy. In this preliminary work, via numerical simulations, we study, for the first time in non-ideal general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) regime, the growth of the magnetic field due to the action of the mean-field dynamo due to sub-scale, unresolved turbulence. The dynamo process, combined with the differential rotation of the (proto-)star, is able to produce an exponential growth of any initial magnetic seed field up to the values required to explain the observations. By varying the dynamo coefficient we obtain different growth rates. We find a quasi-linear dependence of the growth rates on the intensity of the dynamo. Furthermore, the time interval in which exponential growth occurs and the growth rates also seems to depend on the initial configuration of the magnetic field.

topic: The central engine in long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is thought to be a compact object produced by the core collapse of massive stars, but its exact nature (black hole or millisecond magnetar) is still debatable. Although the central engine of GRB collapsars is hidden to direct observation, its properties may be imprinted on the accompanying electromagnetic signals. We aim to decipher the generic properties of central engines that are consistent with prompt observations of long GRBs detected by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Adopting a generic model for the central engine, in which the engine power and activity timescale are independent of each other, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of long GRBs produced by jets that successfully breakout from the star. The intrinsic 2D distribution of simulated collapsar GRBs peaks at lower gamma-ray luminosities and longer durations than the observed one, a prediction that can be tested in the future with more sensitive detectors. Black-hole accretors, whose power and activity time are set by the large-scale magnetic flux through the progenitor star and stellar structure, respectively, are compatible with the properties of the central engine inferred by our model.

title: Accretion-to-jet energy conversion efficiency in GW170817
authors: Om S. Salafia, Bruno Giacomazzo
topic: Based on previously published multi-wavelength modelling of the GRB 170817A jet afterglow, that includes information from the VLBI centroid motion, we construct the posterior probability density distribution on the total energy in the bipolar jets launched by the GW170817 merger remnant. By applying a new numerical-relativity-informed fitting formula for the accretion disk mass, we construct the posterior probability density distribution of the GW170817 remnant disk mass. By combining the two, we estimate the accretion-to-jet energy conversion efficiency in this system, carefully accounting for uncertainties.  Such an efficiency also agrees with that anticipated for the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, provided that the magnetic field in the disk right after the merger is predominantly toroidal (which is expected as a result of the merger dynamics).

title: Bulk Viscous Damping of Density Oscillations in Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Mark Alford, Arus Harutyunyan, Armen Sedrakian
topic: We discuss the damping of density oscillations in dense nuclear matter in the temperature range relevant to neutron star mergers. This damping is due to bulk viscosity arising from the weak interaction ``Urca'' processes of neutron decay and electron capture. The nuclear matter is modelled in the relativistic density functional approach. The bulk viscosity reaches a resonant maximum close to the neutrino trapping temperature, then drops rapidly as temperature rises into the range where neutrinos are trapped in neutron stars. We investigate the bulk viscous dissipation timescales in a post-merger object and identify regimes where these timescales are as short as the characteristic timescale 10 ms, and, therefore, might affect the evolution of the post-merger object. Our analysis indicates that bulk viscous damping would be important at not too high temperatures of the order of a few MeV and densities up to a few times saturation density.

authors: V. A. Acciari, S. Ansoldi, L. A. Antonelli, A. Arbet Engels, D. Baack, A. Babić, B. Banerjee, U. Barres de Almeida, J. A. Barrio et al
topic: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from ultra-relativistic jets launched from the collapsing cores of dying massive stars. They are characterised by an initial phase of bright and highly variable radiation in the keV-MeV band that is likely produced within the jet and lasts from milliseconds to minutes, known as the prompt emission. Subsequently, the interaction of the jet with the external medium generates external shock waves, responsible for the afterglow emission, which lasts from days to months, and occurs over a broad energy range, from the radio to the GeV bands. The afterglow emission is generally well explained as synchrotron radiation by electrons accelerated at the external shock. We find that the broadband spectral energy distribution is double-peaked, with the TeV emission constituting a distinct spectral component that has power comparable to the synchrotron component.

authors: MAGIC Collaboration: V. A. Acciari, S. Ansoldi, L. A. Antonelli, A. Arbet Engels, D. Baack, A. Babić, B. Banerjee, U. Barres de Almeida et al
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) of the long-duration class are the most luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation known in the Universe. They are generated by outflows of plasma ejected at near the speed of light by newly formed neutron stars or black holes of stellar mass at cosmological distances. Prompt flashes of MeV gamma rays are followed by longer-lasting afterglow emission from radio waves to GeV gamma rays, due to synchrotron radiation by energetic electrons in accompanying shock waves. Although emission of gamma rays at even higher, TeV energies by other radiation mechanisms had been theoretically predicted, it had never been detected previously. Here we report the clear detection of GRB 190114C in the TeV band, achieved after many years of dedicated searches for TeV emission from GRBs The observed similarity in the radiated power and temporal behaviour of the TeV and X-ray bands points to processes such as inverse Compton radiation as the mechanism of the TeV emission, while processes such as synchrotron emission by ultrahigh-energy protons are disfavoured due to their low radiative efficiency.

title: Radio Emission from Ultra-stripped Supernovae as Diagnostics for Properties of the Remnant Double Neutron Star Binaries
authors: Tomoki Matsuoka, Keiichi Maeda
topic: An ultra-stripped supernova (SN) is an explosion of a helium or C+O star whose outer envelope has been stripped away by a companion neutron star. A double neutron star (DNS) binary is believed to be left after the explosion, which will emit the gravitational wave later at the coalescence. Recent detections of a few candidates for the ultra-stripped SN have constrained the properties of the explosion and the progenitor, but little information is given as to whether the remnant DNS binary will merge within the cosmic age. A large fraction of the material stripped away from the helium star through the binary interaction is expected to escape from the system and form circumstellar material (CSM). The CSM should be traced by radio emission induced by the collision with the SN ejecta. Based on the stellar evolution models previously developed, we calculate the expected radio luminosities from ultra-stripped SNe. We find that high radio luminosity at its maximum can be an indicator of small separation of a DNS binary leading to its merger within the cosmic age. Our results can be used to optimize the strategy for the radio follow-up observations such as observational epochs and frequencies.

title: Neutron star inner crust: effects of rotation and magnetic fields
authors: Ivo Sengo, Helena Pais, Bruno Franzon, Constança Providência
topic: We study the role of the pasta phases on the properties of rotating and magnetized neutron stars. In order to investigate such systems, we make use of two different relativistic mean-field unified inner-crust--core equations of state, with a different density dependence of the symmetry energy, and an inner-crust computed within a Thomas-Fermi calculation. Special attention is given to the crust-core transition density, and the pasta phases effects on the global properties of stars. The effects of strong magnetic fields and fast rotation are computed by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations self-consistently, taking into account anisotropies induced by the centrifugal and the Lorentz force. The location of the magnetic field neutral line and the maximum of the Lorentz force on the equatorial plane are calculated. The conditions under which they fall inside the inner crust region are discussed. We verified that models with a larger symmetry energy slope show more sensitivity to the variation of the magnetic field.

title: A Variable X-ray Source Close to the Magnetar SGR 1935+2154
authors: A. K. H. Kong, K. L. Li, S. Kim, C. Y. Hui
topic: The recent discovery of a millisecond radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 has initiated an intense discussion about the connection between magnetars and fast radio bursts (FRBs). Although some properties of the radio burst from SGR 1935+2154 are not the same as cosmological FRBs, there are theoretical models which propose a connection between magnetars and FRBs (see review by Margalit et al. 2020). In particular, the role of a magnetar wind nebula is included in some models, and therefore it is worthwhile to investigate the X-ray environment of SGR 1935+2154 in more detail. Here, we report on the discovery of an X-ray transient feature near SGR 1935+2154 using archival Chandra data and discuss its possible origin.

title: Reverse Shocks in Short Gamma-Ray Bursts -- The case of GRB 160821B and prospects as gravitational-wave counterparts
authors: Gavin P Lamb
topic: The shock system that produces the afterglow to GRBs consists of a forward- and a reverse-shock. For short GRBs, observational evidence for a reverse-shock has been sparse, however, the afterglow to GRB 160821B requires a reverse-shock at early times to explain the radio observations. GRB 160821B is additionally accompanied by the best-sampled macronova without a gravitational-wave detection, and an interesting late-time X-ray afterglow behaviour indicative of a refreshed-shock. The presence of an observed reverse-shock in an on-axis short GRB means that the reverse-shock should be considered as a potential counterpart to gravitational-wave detected mergers. As a gravitational-wave counterpart, the afterglow to an off-axis GRB jet can reveal the jet structure -- a reverse-shock will exist in these structured jet systems and the signature of these reverse-shocks, if observed, can indicate the degree of magnetisation in the outflow. Here we show the case of GRB 160821B, and how a reverse-shock will appear for an off-axis observer to a structured jet.

topic: Meteoritic analysis demonstrates that radioactive nuclei heavier than iron were present in the early Solar System. Among them, 129I and 247Cm both have a rapid neutron-capture process (r process) origin and decay on the same timescale (approx 15.6 Myr). We show that the 129I/247Cm abundance ratio in the early Solar System (433 plus minus 184) is immune to galactic evolution uncertainties and represents the first direct observational constraint for the properties of the last r-process event that polluted the pre-solar nebula. We investigate the physical conditions of this event using nucleosynthesis calculations and demonstrate that moderately neutron-rich ejecta can produce the observed ratio. We conclude that a dominant contribution by exceedingly neutron-rich ejecta is highly disfavoured.

topic: Recent observations with the Chandra X-ray telescope continue to detect X-ray emission from the transient GW170817. The current dataset appears consistent both with energy injection by a long-lived central engine and with the onset of a kilonova afterglow, arising from the interaction of the sub-relativistic merger ejecta with the surrounding medium. Long-term monitoring of this source will be essential to test these different models.

title: The jet structure and the intrinsic luminosity function of short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Wei-Wei Tan, Yun-Wei Yu
topic: The joint observation of GW170817 and GRB 170817A indicated that short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) can originate from binary neutron star mergers. Moreover, some SGRBs could be detected off-axis, while the SGRB jets are highly structured. Then, by assuming an universal angular distribution of the jet emission for all SGRBs For self-consistency, this angular distribution is simultaneously constrained by the luminosity and event rate of GRB 170817A. Meanwhile, the intrinsic luminosity function (LF) of the on-axis emission of the jets can be simply described by a single power law with a low-luminosity exponential cutoff. The usually discovered broken-power-law apparent LF for relatively high luminosities can naturally result from the coupling of the intrinsic LF with the angular distribution of the jet emission, as the viewing angles to the SGRBs are arbitrarily distributed.

topic: We present the full panchromatic afterglow light curve data of GW170817, including new radio data as well as archival optical and X-ray data, between 0.5 and 940 days post-merger. By compiling all archival data, and reprocessing a subset of it, we have ensured that the panchromatic dataset is uniform and therefore immune to the differences in data processing or flux determination methods used by different groups. Our fits to the afterglow data using an analytical model that includes VLBI proper motion from Mooley et al (2018), and a structured jet model that ignores the proper motion, indicates that the proper motion measurement needs to be considered while seeking an accurate estimate of the viewing angle.

title: The structure of hydrodynamic γ-ray burst jets
authors: Ore Gottlieb, Ehud Nakar, Omer Bromberg
topic: Here, using a set of 3D simulations we follow the evolution of hydrodynamic long and short GRB jets after breakout and provide a physically motivated post-breakout outflow structure of GRB jets (the structure of weakly magnetized jets is underway). Our simulations feature Rayleigh-Taylor fingers, which grow from the cocoon into the jet and destabilize it. The mixing of jet-cocoon material gives rise to a previously unidentified region between the two, which we denote the jet-cocoon interface (JCI). In lGRBs the mixing is strong, leading to most of the outflow energy to drift into the JCI. In sGRBs, where the medium is lighter, the mixing is weaker, and the JCI and the jet core hold a comparable amount of energy. At larger angles, where the cocoon dominates, the structure is more complex including both an angular and a radial structure. The mixing shapes the prompt light curve and implies that typical afterglows of lGRBs are different from those of sGRBs. The predictions that we provide can be used to infer jet characteristics from prompt and afterglow observations.

title: The Luminosity Distribution of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts under a Structured Jet Scenario
authors: Qi Guo, Daming Wei, Yuanzhu Wang
topic:  In this paper, we calculate the luminosity distribution of sGRBs and its evolution with redshift based on the structured (Gaussian) jet model, and find that the typical luminosity increase with redshift, for nearby sGRBs (such as for luminosity distance less than 200 Mpc) the typical gamma-ray luminosity is just around  which naturally explains the very low radiation luminosity of GRB 170817A. We derived the detection probability of sGRBs by Fermi-GBM and found that the expected detection rate of sGRBs is only about 1 yr-1 within the distance of several hundred Mpc. Finally, we compare our results of gamma-ray luminosity distribution with sGRBs with known redshifts, and found that our results are consistent with the observation, which implies that our simulation results can reproduce the observed luminosity distribution well.

title: Variability in Short Gamma-ray Bursts: Gravitationally Unstable Tidal Tails
authors: Eric R. Coughlin, C. J. Nixon, Jennifer Barnes, Brian D. Metzger, R. Margutti
topic: Short gamma-ray bursts are thought to result from the mergers of two neutron stars or a neutron star and stellar mass black hole. The final stages of the merger are generally accompanied by the production of one or more tidal "tails" of ejecta, which fall back onto the remnant-disc system at late times. Using the results of a linear stability analysis, we show that if the material comprising these tails is modeled as adiabatic and the effective adiabatic index satisfies γ≥5/3, then the tails are gravitationally unstable and collapse to form small-scale knots. We analytically estimate the properties of these knots, including their spacing along the tidal tail and the total number produced, and their effect on the mass return rate to the merger remnant. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of the disruption of a polytropic (with the polytropic and adiabatic indices γ equal), γ=2 neutron star by a black hole, and find agreement between the predictions of the linear stability analysis and the distribution of knots that collapse out of the instability.

title: Pair separation in parallel electric field of a magnetar magnetosphere and narrow spectra of fast radio bursts
authors: Yuan-Pei Yang, Jin-Ping Zhu, Bing Zhang, Xue-Feng Wu
topic: When a magnetar magnetosphere is trigged by crustal deformations, an electric field E|| parallel to the magnetic field line would appear via Alvfén waves in the charge starvation region. If electron-positron pair bunches pre-exist, e.g., via some possible plasma instabilities, in the magnetosphere, these pairs will undergo charge separation in the E|| and in the meantime emit coherent curvature radiation. Following the approach of Yang & Zhang (2018), we find that the superposed curvature radiation becomes narrower due to charge separation, with the width of spectrum depending on the separation between the electron and positron clumps. This mechanism can interpret the narrow spectra of FRBs, in particular, the Galactic FRB 200428 recently detected in association with a hard X-ray burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154.

title: Analytical Solutions of Radiative Transfer Equations in Accretion Discs with Finite Optical Depth
authors: Maryam Samadi, Fahimeh Habibi, Shahram Abbassi
topic: The main purpose of this paper is to obtain analytical solutions for radiative transfer equations related to the vertical structure of accretion discs with finite optical depth. In the non-gray atmosphere, we employ the optical-depth dependent Eddington factor to define the relationship between the mean intensity and radiation stress tensor. Analytical solutions are achieved for two cases: (i) radiative equilibrium, and (ii) a disc with uniform internal heating and both cases are assumed to be in local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE), too. Our results show that for the first case, the surface value of mean intensity with constant Eddington factor is three times larger than that with a variable factor. Moreover, scattering has no role in the vertical radiative structure of discs with the assumptions of the first case. On the other hand, for the second case, we encounter reductions in all radiative quantities as the photon destruction probability decreases (which is equivalent to increasing scattering).

Accordingly, pulsars are born with embryonic incompressible superconducting gluon-quark superfluid cores (SuSu-matter) that are embedded in Minkowski spacetime, whereas the ambient compressible and dissipative media (CDM) are imbedded in curved spacetime. As pulsars cool down, the equilibrium between both spacetime is altered, thereby triggering the well-observed glitch phenomena.

topic: Detection and parameter estimation of binary neutron star merger remnants can shed light on the physics of hot matter at supranuclear densities. Here we develop a fast, simple model that can generate gravitational waveforms, and show it can be used for both detection and parameter estimation of post-merger remnants. The model consists of three exponentially-damped sinusoids with a linear frequency-drift term. The median fitting factors between the model waveforms and numerical-relativity simulations exceed 0.90. We detect remnants at a post-merger signal-to-noise ratio of \geq 7 using a Bayes-factor detection statistic with a threshold of 3000.

authors: Immanuel Christopher Jebaraj, Jasmina Magdalenic, Tatiana Podladchikova, Camilla Scolini, Jens Pomoell, Astrid Veronig, Karin Dissauer, Vratislav Krupar, Emilia Kilpua, Stefaan Poedts
topic: Context: Eruptive events such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares accelerate particles and generate shock waves which can arrive at Earth and can disturb the magnetosphere. Understanding the association between CMEs and CME-driven shocks is therefore highly important for space weather studies. Aims: We present a study of the CME/flare event associated with two type II bursts observed on September 27, 2012. The aim of the study is to understand the relationship between the observed CME and the two distinct shock wave signatures. Methods: The multi-wavelength study of the eruptive event (CME/flare) was complemented with radio triangulation of the associated radio emission and modelling of the CME and the shock wave employing MHD simulations. Results: We found that, although temporal association between the type II bursts and the CME is good, the low-frequency type II(LF-type II) burst occurs significantly higher in the corona than the CME and its relationship to the CME is not straightforward.

The extent to which spallation modifies the final NSM isotopic yields depends on: the ejected abundances, which are determined by the NSM astrophysical conditions and the properties of nuclei far from stability, the ejecta velocity distribution and propagation in interstellar matter, and the spallation cross-sections. Observed solar and stellar r-process yields could thus constrain the velocity distribution of ejected neutron star matter, assuming NSMs are the dominant r-process source

title: Towards a paradigm change in the main heavy r-process nucleosynthesis sites
authors: Aldana Grichener, Noam Soker 
topic: We study the basic properties of three possible r-process scenarios (sites) and compare them to recent observations and theoretical simulations. We find that the common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN) r-process scenario can account for the different observations of r-process nucleosynthesis, including the presence of r-process-rich low-metalicity stars in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies. The neutron star (NS)-NS merger scenario and the collapsar scenario encounter some difficulties. Despite that, we conclude that it is very likely that more than one r-process scenario exists, with a significant contribution by the CEJSN r-process scenario. We give a prescription to include this scenario in population synthesis studies of the r-process.

We develop a phase-agnostic likelihood model that uses only the spectral content for parameter estimation and demonstrate the calculation of a Bayesian upper limit in the absence of a signal. With the millisecond magnetar model, we show that for an event like GW170817, the ellipticity of a long-lived remnant can be constrained to less than about 0.5 in the parameter space used.

authors: Tim Dietrich, Katy Clough
topic: we perform numerical relativity simulations of a binary neutron star merger, including a phenomenological description of the nucleon-nucleon-axion bremsstrahlung to quantify the effects of such a cooling channel on the dynamical evolution. While our simulations show a difference in the temperature profile of the merger remnant, the imprint of the axion via nucleon-nucleon-axion bremsstrahlung on the emitted gravitational wave signal and the ejecta mass is too small to improve constraints on the axion mass with current or future planned detectors. Whilst we consider a limited number of cases, and a simplified cooling model, these broadly represent the "best case" scenario, thus, a more thorough investigation is unlikely to change the conclusions, at least for this particular interaction channel.

title: Using failed supernovae to constrain the Galactic r-process element production
authors: B. Wehmeyer, C. Frohlich, B. Côté, M. Pignatari, F.-K. Thielemann
topic: The large scatter of r-process elements in the early Galaxy suggests that the r-process is made by rare events, like compact binary mergers and rare sub-classes of supernovae. Although being rare, neutron star mergers alone have difficulties to explain the observed enhancement of r-process elements in the lowest metallicity stars compared to Fe. In this work we investigate another complementary scenario, where the r-process occurs in neutron star-black hole mergers in addition to neutron star mergers. Neutron star-black hole mergers would eject similar amounts of r-process matter as neutron star mergers, but only the neutron star progenitor would have produced Fe.

authors: I. Tews, A. Schwenk
topic: We investigate how a phase transition from neutron-star matter to spin-polarized neutron matter affects the equation of state and mass-radius relation of neutron stars, Hence, such a transition limits the maximum mass of neutron stars to lie below 2.6-2.9Msun.

title: Neutron star binary orbits in their host potential: effect on early r-process enrichment
authors: Matteo Bonetti, Albino Perego, Massimo Dotti, Gabriele Cescutti
topic: This results in a significant geometrical dilution of the amount of produced r−process elements that fall back and pollute the host galaxy gas reservoir. The combination of dilution and small number statistics produces a large scatter in the expected r-process enrichment within a single UFD or classical dwarf galaxy. Comparison between our results and observed europium abundances reveals a tension that even a systematic choice of optimistic parameters in our models cannot release. Such a discrepancy could point to the need of additional r-process production sites that suffer less severe dilution or to a population of extremely fast merging binaries.

topic: We present the first three-dimensional general relativistic, full transport neutrino radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD) simulations of the black hole-accretion disk-wind system produced by the GW170817 merger. We show that the small but non-negligible optical depths lead to neutrino transport globally coupling the disk electron fraction, which we capture by solving the transport equation with a Monte Carlo method. The resulting absorption drives up the electron fraction in a structured, continuous outflow, with electron fraction as high as Ye∼0.4 in the extreme polar region. We show via nuclear reaction network and radiative transfer calculations that nucleosynthesis in the disk wind will produce a blue kilonova.

topic: Here, we explore the latter by performing a GRMHD BNS merger simulation extending up to \sim 100 ms after merger, much longer than any previous simulation of this kind. This allows us to (i) study the emerging structure and amplification of the magnetic field and observe a clear saturation at magnetic energy 10^51. We follow the magnetically supported expansion of the outer layers of the remnant NS and its evolution into an ellipsoidal shape without any surrounding torus. We also argue that the conditions at the end of the simulation disfavor later jet formation on subsecond timescales if no BH is formed.

authors: Gor Oganesyan, Stefano Ascenzi, Marica Branchesi, Om Sharan Salafia, Simone Dall'Osso, Giancarlo Ghirlanda
topic: Here we show that the high-latitude emission from a structured jet can naturally produce an X-ray plateau in gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves, independent of the radiation from an external shock. We calculate the radiation from a switched-off shell featuring an angular structure in both its relativistic bulk motion and intrinsic brightness. Our model is able to explain the shallow decay phase (plateau) often observed in GRB X-ray light curves. We discuss the possible contribution of the structured jet high-latitude emission to other distinctive features of GRB X-ray light curves, and its capability to explain the chromatic optical/X-ray light curve properties.

topic: Here we investigate the use of fine-structure, line-binned opacities that preserve the integral of the opacity over frequency. Advantages of this area-preserving approach over the traditional expansion-opacity formalism include the ability to pre-calculate opacity tables that are independent of the type of hydrodynamic expansion and that eliminate the computational expense of calculating opacities within radiation-transport simulations. Tabular opacities are generated for all 14 lanthanides as well as a representative actinide element, uranium. We demonstrate that spectral simulations produced with the line-binned opacities agree well with results produced with the more accurate continuous Monte Carlo Sobolev approach, as well as with the commonly used expansion-opacity formalism

authors: N. Fraija, D. Lopez-Camara, A.C. Caligula do E. S. Pedreira, B. Betancourt Kamenetskaia, P. Veres, S. Dichiara
topic: We calculate the light curves obtained from an analytic model in which the synchrotron and SSC emission (in the fast- or slow-cooling regime) of an off-axis top-hat jet and a quasi-spherical outflow are decelerated in either a homogeneous or a wind-like circumburst medium. We show that the synchrotron emission of the quasi-spherical outflow is stronger than that of the off-axis jet during the first \sim 10 - 20 days, and weaker during the next \geq 80 days. For GRB 170817A, we find using our model that the synchrotron emission generated by the quasi-spherical outflow and off-axis top-hat jet increase.

We simulate radiative transfer in the ejecta in either 1D spherical or 2D cylindrical spatial geometry. Our models that fit the bolometric luminosity of AT 2017gfo (the kilonova associated with the first neutron star merger discovered in gravitational waves, GW170817) do not simultaneously fit the B, V, and I time evolution. However, we find that the trends of the evolution in B and V magnitudes are better matched by the fallback model relative to the pulsar model, implying the time dependence of the remnant source influences the color evolution.

To parameterize the nuclear EoS, we use a different approach, expanding from pure nuclear matter rather than from symmetric nuclear matter to make use of recent quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations.

In this case, in fact, the merger remnant has an excess angular momentum yielding a more extended and "colder" object, with reduced ability to shed mass dynamically.

Abundance patterns and rates of nuclear energy production. We show that the accumulation of fissioning material during the r process can strongly affect the free neutron abundance after the r-process freeze-out. This leads to a significant impact on the abundances of heavy nuclei that undergo α decay or spontaneous fission, affecting the radioactive energy production by the ejecta at timescales relevant for kilonova emission.

The very low-Ye, fission-cycling ejecta of an r-process event need only constitute 10-30% of the total ejecta mass to accommodate most actinide abundances of metal-poor stars. We find that our empirical Ye distributions of ejecta are similar to those inferred from studies of GW170817 mass ejecta ratios, which is consistent with neutron-star mergers being a source of the heavy elements in metal-poor, r-process enhanced stars.

topic: Here, we perform a set of simulations of low-mass NSBH mergers, including systems compatible with GW170817. Our simulations use a composition and temperature dependent equation of state (DD2) and approximate neutrino transport, but no magnetic fields. We find that low-mass NSBH mergers produce remnant disks significantly less massive than previously expected, and consistent with the post-merger outflow mass inferred from GW170817 for moderately asymmetric mass ratio. The dynamical ejecta produced by systems compatible with GW170817 is negligible except if the mass ratio and black hole spin are at the edge of the allowed parameter space. That dynamical ejecta is cold, neutron-rich, and surprisingly slow for ejecta produced during the tidal disruption of a neutron star.

topic: Although high-energy neutrinos were not detected from this event, mergers of neutron stars are expected to produce such high-energy particles. Relativistic jets are launched when neutron stars merge. If the jets contain protons, they can emit high-energy neutrinos through photomeson production. In addition, neutron star mergers produce massive and fast ejecta, which can be a source of Galactic high-energy cosmic rays above the knee.

title: Misaligned snowplough effect and the electromagnetic counterpart to black hole binary mergers
authors: Fabrícia A. C. Pereira, Giuseppe Lodato, Irapuan Rodrigues, Márcio E. S. Alves, Daniel J. Price
topic: We estimate the accretion rates produced when a circumprimary gas disc is pushed into the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH) by the tidal force of the decaying secondary during a SMBH merger. Using the 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code. We find that discs with small inclination angles (\leq 10 degrees) produce an increase in luminosity exceeding the Eddington rate. we show that the misaligned snowplough effect remains important even for angles larger than the disc aspect ratio. The rise in the accretion rate produced by discs inclined at small angles to the binary orbit can produce an electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational wave signal emitted from final stages of the binary orbital decay.

title: Charged Compact Binary Coalescence Signal and Electromagnetic Counterpart of Plunging BH-NS mergers
authors: Bing Zhang
topic: If at least one of the members of a compact binary coalescence is charged, the inspiral of the two members would generate a Poynting flux with an increasing power, giving rise to a brief electromagnetic counterpart temporally associated with the chirp signal of the merger (with possibly a small temporal offset), which we term as the {\em charged Compact Binary Coalescence} (cCBC) signal. We develop a general theory of cCBC for any mass and amount of charge for each member.

authors: Houri Ziaeepour
topic: We use published data in radio, optical and X-ray bands to analyze and model afterglows of GW/GRB 170817A. Our analysis is based on a phenomenological gamma-ray burst generator model which we previously used to study the prompt gamma-ray emission of this important transient. We find a multi-component model and a few of its variants that are consistent with broad band \sim 1 year observations of afterglows, once the contribution of kilonova in optical/IR band is taken into account. phenomenological models

title: The chemical evolution of r-process elements from neutron star mergers: the role of a 2-phase interstellar medium
authors: Ralph Schönrich, David H. Weinberg

We show that the observed super-solar "Eu/alpha" at intermediate metallicities implies that a significant fraction of Eu originates from NM or another source besides ccSNe, and that these non-ccSN yields are preferentially deposited in the star-forming phase of the ISM at early times.

title: Bayesian Analysis on the X-ray Spectra of the Binary Neutron Star Merger GW170817
authors: En-Tzu Lin, Hoi-Fung Yu, Albert K.H. Kong
topic: For the first time, we present a Bayesian time-resolved spectral study of the X-ray afterglow datasets of GW170817/GRB17017A observed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.  While our results are consistent with the other works using Cash statistic within uncertainty, the Bayesian analysis we performed in this work have yielded Gaussian-like parameter distributions. We also obtained the parameter uncertainties directly from their posterior probability distributions. The X-ray flux has been fading since \sim160 days after the merger and has returned to the level as first discovered after one year. Our result shows that the X-ray spectrum of GW170817/GRB170817A is well-described by a simple power-law originated from non-thermal slow-cooling synchrotron radiation.

title: Discrete and Continuous Ejection Models of the Radio Source Associated with GW170817

topic: the discrete region includes all of the radio flux, and there is likely a synchrotron self absorption (SSA) spectral turnover. The velocity can constrain the kinematics and the SSA turnover has been used to constrain the size to much smaller than can be done with an unresolved VLBI image, allowing one to estimate the associated plasmoid size directly from the data and improve estimates of the energetics. Models of the radio emission for both a turbulent, protonic, discrete ballistic ejection and a high dissipation region within an otherwise invisible Poynting flux dominated positron-electron jet are considered. Even though only valid after day 110, this independent analysis augments traditional GRB light curve studies, providing additional constraints on the merger event.

We also show that these equations can be written as a first-order symmetric hyperbolic system, implying local existence and uniqueness of solutions to the equations of motion. We use an arbitrary equation of state and do not make any simplifying symmetry or near-equilibrium assumption, requiring only physically natural conditions on the fields. These results pave the way for the inclusion of bulk viscosity effects in simulations of gravitational-wave signals coming from neutron star mergers.

title: Late afterglow emission statistics: a clear link between GW170817 and bright short GRBs
authors: Kai-Kai Duan, Zhi-Ping Jin, Fu-Wen Zhang, Yi-Ming Zhu, Xiang Li, Yi-Zhong Fan, Da-Ming Wei
topic:  the afterglow emission of the bright sGRBs and GW170817/GRB 170817A form a natural and continuous sequence, though separated by an observation time gap. If viewed on-axis, the forward shock afterglow emission of GW170817/GRB 170817A would be among the brightest ones detected so far. This provides a strong evidence for the GW170817-like merger origin of bright sGRBs, and suggests that the detection of the forward shock afterglow emission of most neutron star merger events are more challenging than the case of GW170817 since usually the mergers will be more distant and the viewing angles are plausibly higher.

topic: We suggest that neutron star mergers eject an ultra-relativistic envelope of mass 1e10-7 Msun, which helps explain the gamma-ray burst from GW170817. One ejection mechanism is the ablation of the neutron star surface by the burst of neutrinos in the first 30 microsec.  Another, more efficient, mechanism for inflating the ultra-relativistic envelope is an internal shock in the massive ejecta from the merger. A strong shock is expected if the merger product is a magnetar, which emits a centrifugally accelerated wind.

topic: However, these models generate local cosmic NS-NS merger rate in old host galaxies that are below the LIGO/Virgo estimate. The reason behind this tension is the predicted delay time distribution between star formation and NS-NS mergers that favors short delays. However, we show that such distribution is consistent with observations of Galactic NS-NS binaries; 50% of which show very long merger times (much longer than Hubble time). Once model distributions are convolved with continuous prolonged (10 Gyr) star formation in the Galactic disk, then 20-70% (depending on a model) of the predicted NS-NS population has very long current Galactic merger times

authors: Dhruv Desai, Brian D. Metzger, Francois Foucart
topic: One source of late-time engine activity is fall-back accretion of bound tidal ejecta. Here, we re-examine the impact of heating due to rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis on rate of the fall-back accretion, using ejecta properties obtained from numerical relativity simulations of NS-BH mergers in a toy model for the dynamical influence of nuclear heating. Depending on the mass of the remnant black hole, r-process heating can imprint a variety of fall-back curve shapes, ranging from temporal lulls of up to tens of seconds to complete late-time cut-off in the fall-back rate. This behavior is robust to realistic variations in the nuclear heating experienced by different parts of the ejecta.

Depending on the magnitude of the energy injection and the remnant density, we find two types of outflows: one with a narrow relativistic core and one with a wide-angle, but mildly relativistic outflow.

In particular, we investigate the effect of the kick velocities that neutron star binaries receive upon their formation, in the building block galaxies (BBs) that partly formed the stellar halo by merging with our Galaxy.  We conclude that our assumption of instantaneous mixing is most likely inaccurate for modelling the r-process enrichment of the Galactic halo, or an additional production site for r-process elements is necessary to explain the presence of low-metallicity halo stars with high Eu abundances.

title: Hypermassive Neutron Star Disk Outflows and Blue Kilonovae
authors: Steven Fahlman, Rodrigo Fernández
topic: We study mass ejection from accretion disks around newly-formed hypermassive neutron stars (HMNS). Standard kilonova model fits to GW170817 require at least a lanthanide-poor ('blue') and lanthanide-rich ('red') component. but average disk outflow velocities from existing long-term HMNS simulations fall short of the inferred value 0.25c.  Here we use time-dependent, axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations of HMNS disks to explore the limits of the model and its ability to account for observations. For physically plausible parameter choices compatible with GW170817, we find that hydrodynamic models that use shear viscosity to transport angular momentum cannot eject matter with mass-averaged velocities larger than \sim 0.15c. While outflow velocities in our simulations can exceed the asymptotic value for a steady-state neutrino-driven wind, the increase in the average velocity due to viscosity is not sufficient. Therefore, viscous HMNS disk winds cannot reproduce by themselves the ejecta properties inferred from multi-component fits to kilonova light curves from GW170817

title: Analysis of the duration--hardness ratio plane of gamma-ray bursts using skewed distributions
authors: Mariusz Tarnopolski
topic: existance of an intermedate GRB, between sGRB and lGRB, by analysing statistics of GRB. It is found that the best description is given by a two-component mixture of skewed Student-t distributions, which outperforms any other model considered. This implies that the distribution of the studied parameters is intrinsically skewed, introducing spurious Gaussian components, and hence the third class is unlikely to be a real phenomenon. Its existence, based on statistical inference, is therefore rejected as unnecessary to explain the observations.

title: GW170817: The energy extraction process of the off-axis relativistic outflow and the constraint on the equation of state of neutron stars
authors: Yuan-Zhu Wang, Dong-Sheng Shao, Jin-Liang Jiang, Shao-Peng Tang, Xiao-Xiao Ren, Fu-Wen Zhang, Zhi-Ping Jin, Yi-Zhong Fan, Da-Ming Wei 
topic: In this work we use the results of these modeling (off-axis energetic relativistic outflow component launched) to examine the energy extraction process of the central engine. We show that the magnetic process (i.e., the Blandford-Znajek mechanism) is favored, while the neutrino process usually requires a too massive accretion disk if the duration of the central engine activity is comparable to the observed. We propose that the GRB observations are helpful to constrain the combined tidal parameter by adopting the accretion disk mass distribution estimated in BZ mechanism.

topic: Parity violation and its effects for neutrinos in astrophysical contexts have been considered earlier in pioneering papers of Hawking and Vilenkin. neutrino oscillations. Here we show that since in astrophysical scenarios a huge number of neutrinos may be emitted, the smallness of the magnetic moment, when coupled with parity violation, is compensated by the sheer number of neutrinos. The merger of neutron stars would leave behind a short pulse of electromagnetic synchrotron radiation even if the neutrino jet in the merger points away from the neutrino detectors.

authors: K. P. Mooley, D. A. Frail, D. Dobie, E. Lenc, A. Corsi, K. De, A.J. Nayana, S. Makhathini, I. Heywood et al
topic: We present new 0.6-10 GHz observations of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 covering the period up to 300 days post-merger, taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and the MeerKAT telescope. Such a slope cannot be produced by a quasi-isotropic (cocoon-dominated) outflow, but is instead the classic signature of a relativistic jet. This provides strong observational evidence that GW170817 produced a successful jet, and directly demonstrates the link between binary neutron star mergers and short-hard GRBs. Using simple analytical arguments, we derive constraints on the geometry and the jet opening angle of GW170817. These results are consistent with those from our companion Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) paper, reporting superluminal motion in GW170817.

topic: We combine gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) data to perform a Bayesian parameter estimation of the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817. The EM likelihood is constructed from a fit to a large number of numerical relativity simulations which we combine with a lower bound on the mass of the remnant's accretion disk inferred from the modeling of the EM light curve. In comparison with previous works, our analysis yields a more precise determination of the tidal deformability of the binary, for which the EM data provide a lower bound, and of the mass ratio of the binary, with the EM data favoring a smaller mass asymmetry.

title: Jet launching from binary black hole-neutron star mergers: Dependence on black hole spin, binary mass ratio and magnetic field orientation
authors: Milton Ruiz, Stuart L. Shapiro, Antonios Tsokaros
topic: sing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of BHNS undergoing merger we showed that a magnetically--driven jet can be launched by the remnant if the NS is endowed with a dipole B field extending from the interior into the exterior as in a radio pulsar. Here, as a crucial step in establishing BHNS systems as viable progenitors of central engines that power short gamma--ray bursts (sGRBs) and thereby solidify their role as multimessenger sources, we survey different BHNS configurations that differ in BH spin. By the time we terminate our simulations, we do not observe either an outflow or a large-scale B field collimation in the other configurations we simulate. These results suggest that future multimessenger detections from BHNSs are more likely produced by binaries with highly spinning BH companions and small tilt-angle B fields.

topic: In this paper, we have investigated rotation-induced gravitational radiation from possibly existing, radially oscillating pulsars after binary neutron star mergers, and find that this mechanism can efficiently damp the radial oscillations. The resulting gravitational waves (GWs) could have a non-negligible contribution to the high-frequency spectrum. We provide an order-of-magnitude estimate of the event rate and suggest that such GW events would be detectable with the advanced LIGO/Virgo or next-generation detectors. Our discussion can also be applied to newborn, radially oscillating, millisecond pulsars formed through the other astrophysical processes.

topic: We show that a long-lived magnetized NS with a poloidal field is fully consistent with the electromagnetic dataset, when spin down losses are dominated by gravitational wave (GW) emission. The required ellipticity can result from a toroidal magnetic field component much stronger than the poloidal component, a configuration expected from a NS newly formed from a merger. Abrupt magnetic dissipation of the toroidal component can lead to the appearance of X-ray flares, analogous to the one observed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. we identify a low-significance  temporal feature at 155 d, consistent with a sudden reactivation of the central NS. Energy injection from the NS spin down into the relativistic shock is negligible, and the underlying continuum is fully accounted for by a structured jet seen off-axis.

title: r-process enrichment of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies by fast merging double neutron stars
authors: Mohammadtaher Safarzadeh, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Jeff. J. Andrews, Tassos Fragos, Phillip Macias, Evan Scannapieco
topic: However, it is difficult to reconcile the large natal kicks and long average merging times of Double Neutron Stars (DNSs), with the levels of r-process enrichment seen in ultra faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies such as Reticulum II and Tucana III. Assuming that such dwarf systems have lost a significant fraction of their stellar mass through tidal stripping, we conclude that contrary to most current models, it is the DNSs with rather large natal kicks but very short merging timescales that can enrich UFD-type galaxies. These binaries are either on highly eccentric orbits, or form with very short separations due to an additional mass-transfer between the first-born neutron star and a naked helium star, progenitor of the second-born neutron star. These DNSs are born with a frequency that agrees with the statistics of the r-process UFDs, and merge well within the virial radius of their host halos, therefore contributing significantly to their r-process enrichment.

authors: Shlomo Dado, Arnon Dar
topic: The two leading theoretical models of GRBs and their afterglows, the fireball model and the cannonball model, have been widely confronted with the mounting observational data on GRBs and SHBs during the last two decades. Both have claimed success in reproducing the observational data, despite their complexity and diversity. This claimed success, however, may reflect multiple choices and the use of many free adjustable parameters, rather than the true validity of the models. Only confrontation of the key falsifiable predictions of the models with solid observational data can test their validity. Such critical tests are summarized in this report.

title: Nonthermal afterglow of the binary neutron star merger GW170817: a more natural modeling of electron energy distribution leads to a qualitatively different new solution
authors: Haoxiang Lin, Tomonori Totani, Kenta Kiuchi
topic: nonthermal afterglow  -- synchrotron radiation by shock-accelerated electrons. Assumption:  all electrons in the shock are accelerated as a nonthermal population, affecting the peak frequency of the afterglow spectrum. Here we present Bayesian fitting to the observed data with a more natural electron energy distribution, in which the acceleration efficiency is a free parameter. Interestingly, the maximum likelihood solutions are found with radio flux below numax in the early phase, in contrast to previous studies that found the radio frequency always above numax. The jet energy and interstellar medium density are increased by 1--2 orders of magnitude from the conventional modeling, though these are still consistent with other constraints.

title: Pre-merger electromagnetic counterparts of binary compact stars
authors: Jie-Shuang Wang, Fang-Kun Peng, Kinwah Wu, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: We investigate emission signatures of binary compact star gravitational wave sources consisting of strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs) and/or white dwarfs (WDs) in their late-time inspiral phase. Because of electromagnetic interactions between the magnetospheres of the two compact stars, a substantial amount of energy will be extracted in the last few seconds before the two stars merge, when the binary system contains a NS with a surface magnetic field 10 to 12 gauss. The induced electric field in the process can accelerate charged particles up to the EeV energy range. Synchrotron radiation is emitted from energetic electrons, with radiative energies reaching the GeV energy for binary NSs and the MeV energy for NS - WD or double WD binaries. In addition, a blackbody component is also presented and it peaks at several to hundreds keV for binary NSs and at several keV for NS - WD or double WD binaries. The strong angular dependence of the synchrotron radiation and the isotropic nature of the blackbody radiation lead to distinguishable modulation patterns between the two emission components. If coherent curvature radiation is presented, fast radio bursts could be produced.

title: The neutron star merger GW170817 points to collapsars as the main r-process source
authors: Daniel M. Siegel, Jennifer Barnes, Brian D. Metzger
topic: Here we show that collapsar accretion disks also produce neutron-rich outflows that synthesize heavy r-process nuclei, despite the comparatively proton-rich composition of the infalling star. Though occurring less frequently than mergers, the much greater accreted mass in collapsars---and their correspondingly larger disk wind ejecta---implicate them as dominant contributors to the Galactic r-process. Collapsars provide the rare r-process source needed to promptly enrich a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies early in the Universe which is also compatible with the Galactic chemical enrichment of europium relative to iron over longer timescales. We predict an excess in the late-time near-infrared emission from GRB supernovae, testable by future observations.

authors: David Radice, Albino Perego, Kenta Hotokezaka, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Steven A. Fromm, Luke F. Roberts
topic: General-relativistic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with viscosity reveal a new outflow mechanism operating in unequal mass binaries on dynamical timescales and enabled by turbulent viscosity. These "viscous-dynamical" ejecta are launched during merger due to the thermalization of mass exchange streams between the secondary and the primary neutron star. They are characterized by asymptotic velocities extending up to 0.8c. The radioactive decay of the expanding viscous-dynamical ejecta could produce bright kilonova transients with signatures of free neutron decay in the first hour and enhanced near infrared flux on a timescale of a few days. The synchrotron remnant produced by the interaction between the ejecta and the interstellar medium could also be significantly enhanced by viscosity. Such remnant could be detected in the case of GW170817 as a rebrightening of the radio signal in the next months to years.

We examine both simple isolated dwarf disc galaxies and cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-type galaxies, and compare the (Eu/Fe) and (Eu/{\alpha}) evolution with recent observations, including the HERMES-GALAH survey. We find that neither electron-capture supernovae or neutrino-driven winds are able to adequately produce heavy neutron-capture elements such as Eu in quantities to match observations. Both neutron-star mergers and magneto-rotational supernovae are able to produce these elements in sufficient quantities.

In thick disc stars, the ratio is found to be constant, while the and  ratios decrease as a function of the metallicity.  These observations clearly indicate a different nucleosynthesis history in the thick disc between Eu and Gd-Dy. We also find that the alpha-rich metal-rich stars are also enriched in r-process elements. his data may help to constrain chemical evolution models of Milky Way r- and s-process elements and the yields of massive stars.

title: Constraining the Outflow Structure of the Binary Neutron Star Merger Event GW170817 with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo Analysis
authors: Yiyang Wu, Andrew MacFadyen
topic: We utilize a physically motivated analytic two-parameter model called the "boosted fireball" for the outflow structure after it has expanded far from the merger site and has entered the self-similar coasting phase. This model consists of a family of outflows with a structure varying smoothly between a highly collimated ultra-relativistic jet and an isotropic fireball. We simulate the dynamical evolution, starting with "boosted fireball" initial conditions, of 240 outflows using the moving-mesh relativistic hydrodynamics code JET to follow their evolution through the afterglow phase. We compute synchrotron spectra from the hydrodynamic simulations using the standard synchrotron radiation model. We develop a synthetic light curve generator with an efficient sampling speed. Our results favor the relativistic structured jet, with a jet opening angle \sim 5 deg and Lorentz factor \sim 175, viewed from an off-axis angle of 27(+9-3) deg.

topic:  it remains unclear whether and how the central engine can produce such structured jets. Here, we utilize 3D GRMHD simulations starting with a black hole surrounded by a magnetized torus with properties typically expected of a post-merger system. We follow the jet, as it is self-consistently launched, from the scale of the compact object out to more than 3 orders of magnitude in distance. We find that this naturally results in a structured jet, which is collimated by the disk wind into a half-opening angle of roughly 10 degrees, its emission can explain features of both the prompt and afterglow emission of GRB170817A for a 30 degree observing angle. Our work is the first to compute the afterglow, in the context of a binary merger, from a relativistic magnetized jet self-consistently generated by an accreting black hole, with the jet's transverse structure determined by the accretion physics and not prescribed at any point.

Our motivation is to define which astrophysical sites have significantly contributed to the total mass of r-process elements present in our Galaxy. We found discrepancies with the neutron star (NS-NS) merger scenario. One solution is to assume an extra production site of Eu that would be active in the early universe, but would fade away with increasing metallicity. If this is correct, this extra site could be responsible for roughly 50% of the Eu production in the early universe, before the onset of Type~Ia supernovae. Rare classes of supernovae could be this additional r-process source, but hydrodynamic simulations still need to ensure the conditions for a robust r-process pattern.

We find that a bump appears on the bolometric luminosity light curve due to the inhomogeneous mass distribution in the latitudinal direction. The decay slope of the single-band light curve becomes flatter and the spectrum also deviates from a single-temperature blackbody radiation spectrum due to the gradient in the velocity distribution of the ejecta. Future detection or non-detection of such signatures would be useful to test the mass ejection geometry in BH-NS mergers.

The amount of r-process elements synthesised in BHNS mergers is estimated to be a factor 1 -- 0.01\% of the BNS.  due to the smaller dynamical ejecta and merger rates for the former. We compute the EM luminosities and light curves for the early- and late-time emissions from the ultra-relativistic jet, sub-relativistic dynamical ejecta and wind, and the mildly-relativistic cocoon for typical ejecta parameters.

title: Fingerprints of heavy element nucleosynthesis in the late-time lightcurves of kilonovae
authors: Meng-Ru Wu, Jennifer Barnes, Gabriel Martinez-Pinedo, Brian D. Metzger
topic: At early times (~days) most of the r-process heating arises from a large statistical ensemble of beta-decays, which thermalize efficiently while the ejecta is still dense, generating a heating rate that is reasonably approximated by a single power-law. However, at later times (weeks to months), the decay energy input can possibly be dominated by a discrete number of alpha-decays following the beta-decay of 225Ra which liberate more energy per decay and thermalize with greater efficiency than beta-decay products. Late-time nebular observations of kilonovae which constrain the radioactive power provide the potential to identify signatures of these individual isotopes, thus confirming the production of heavy nuclei. In order to constrain the bolometric light to the required accuracy, multi-epoch & wide-band observations are required with sensitive instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope

title: Radioactive \gamma-Ray Emissions from Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Li-Xin Li
topic: According to the theoretical model, the optical radiation from a neutron star merger originates from the radioactive decay of unstable nuclides freshly synthesized in the merger ejecta. In about a day the ejecta transits from an optically thick state to an optically thin state due to its subrelativistic expansion. Hence, we expect that about a day after the merger, the gamma-ray photons produced by radioactive decays start to escape from the ejecta and make it bright in the MeV band. In this paper, we study the features of the radioactive gamma-ray emission from a neutron star merger, including the brightness and the spectrum, and discuss the observability of the gamma-ray emission. Under favorable conditions, a prominent pair annihilation line can be present in the gamma-ray spectrum. Requires D less 12Mpc.

topic: Here, we implement empirically derived inter-correlated distributions of initial binary parameters primary mass (M1), mass ratio (q), orbital period (P), and eccentricity (e). Unexpectedly, the introduction of inter-correlated initial binary parameters leads to only a small decrease in the predicted merger rates by a factor of 2 − 3 relative to the previously used non-correlated initial distributions. The formation of compact object mergers in the isolated classical binary evolution favors initial binaries with stars of comparable masses (q = 0.5 − 1) at intermediate orbital periods (log P (days) = 2 − 4)

topic: The recent multi-messenger discovery of binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 showed that \gamma-ray emission in short GRBs is wider than the central energetic narrow cone, and weakly expands out to tens of degrees. Here we explore some of the observational consequences of this structured emission, taking the reconstructed angular emission profile of gamma-ray burst GRB170817A to be typical. We calculate the expected fraction of gravitational-wave observations from BNS mergers that will have an observed GRB counterpart to be \sim 30\%, implying that joint gravitational-wave and GRB observations will be common. Further, we find that \sim 10% of observed short GRBs occur within 200 Mpc. Finally, we estimate a BNS merger rate of 500

title: Are fast radio bursts the most likely electromagnetic counterpart of neutron star mergers resulting in prompt collapse?
authors: Vasileios Paschalidis, Milton Ruiz
topic: Moreover, we find that most models of the BNS mass function we study here predict that the majority of prompt-collapse BNS mergers have q greater 0.8. Prompt-collapse BNS mergers with mass ratio may not be accompanied by detectable kilonovae or short gamma-ray bursts, because they unbind a negligible amount of mass and form negligibly small accretion disks onto the remnant black hole. We call such BNS mergers "orphan". Through simulations in full general relativity of BNSs endowed with an initial dipole magnetosphere, we find that the energy in the magnetosphere following black hole formation is  in 1 ms, as has been found in previous studies, matches the premerger magnetospheric luminosity. These magnetospheric signals are not beamed, and their duration and power agrees with those of non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs).

title: Physical conditions for the r-process I. radioactive energy sources of kilonovae
authors: Shinya Wanajo
topic: In previous studies power-law-type heating rates have frequently been used, which may be inadequate if the ejecta are dominated by nuclei other than the A ~ 130 region. We consider, therefore, two reference abundance distributions that match the r-process residuals to the solar abundances for A above 69 (light trans-iron plus r-process elements) and A above 90 (r-process elements). Nucleosynthetic abundances are obtained by using free-expansion models with three parameters: expansion velocity, entropy, and electron fraction. Radioactive energies are calculated as an ensemble of weighted free-expansion models that reproduce the reference abundance patterns. The results are compared with the bolometric luminosity (above a few days since merger) of the kilonova associated with GW170817. If this is the case, the event GW170817 is best explained by the production of both light trans-iron and r-process elements that originate from dynamical ejecta and subsequent disk outflows from the neutron star merger.

title: Stochastic Chemical Evolution of Galactic Subhalos and the Origin of r-Process Elements
authors: Takuya Ojima, Yuhri Ishimaru, Shinya Wanajo, Nikos Prantzos, Patrick Francois
topic: the average coalescence timescale of NSMs appears to be > 100 Myr. most of previous chemical evolution models indicate that the observed early appearance and large dispersion of [r/Fe] in Galactic halo stars at [Fe/H] less -2.5 favors shorter coalescence times of 1-10 Myr. We argue that this is not the case for the models assuming the formation of the Galactic halo from clustering of subhalos with different star formation histories as suggested by Ishimaru et al. (2015). We present a stochastic chemical evolution model of the subhalos, in which the site of the r-process is assumed to be mainly NSMs with a coalescence timescale of 100 Myr.  Our results show that the less massive subhalos evolve at lower metallicities and generate highly r-process-enhanced stars. An assembly of these subhalos leaves behind the large star-to-star scatters of [r/Fe] in the Galactic halo as observed. However, the observed scatters of [Sr/Ba] at low metallicities indicate the presence of an additional site that partially contributes to the enrichment of light neutron-capture elements such as Sr.

title: Compact radio emission indicates a structured jet was produced by a binary neutron star merger
authors: G. Ghirlanda, O. S. Salafia, Z. Paragi, A. Perego, et al
topic: The binary neutron star merger event GW170817 was detected through both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves. Its afterglow emission may have been produced by either a narrow relativistic jet or an isotropic outflow. High spatial resolution measurements of the source size and displacement can discriminate between these scenarios. We present Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations, performed 207.4 days after the merger, using a global network of 32 radio telescopes. The apparent source size is constrained to be smaller than 2.5 milliarcseconds at the 90% confidence level. This excludes the isotropic outflow scenario, which would have produced a larger apparent size, indicating that GW170817 produced a structured relativistic jet.

title: Long-term GRMHD Simulations of Neutron Star Merger Accretion Disks: Implications for Electromagnetic Counterparts
authors: Rodrigo Fernández, Alexander Tchekhovskoy, Eliot Quataert, Francois Foucart, Daniel Kasen
topic: We investigate the long-term evolution of black hole accretion disks formed in neutron star mergers. These disks expel matter that contributes to an r-process kilonova, and can produce relativistic jets powering short gamma-ray bursts. Here we report the results of a three-dimensional, general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of such a disk which is evolved for long enough 6s to achieve completion of mass ejection far from the disk. Our model starts with a poloidal field, and fully resolves the most unstable mode of the magnetorotational instability. We parameterize the dominant microphysics and neutrino cooling effects, and compare with axisymmetric hydrodynamic models with shear viscosity. The GRMHD model ejects mass in two ways: a prompt MHD-mediated outflow and a late-time, thermally-driven wind once the disk becomes advective. The total amount of unbound mass ejected (0.013Msun, or \approx 40\% of the initial torus mass) is twice as much as in hydrodynamic models, with higher average velocity (0.1c) and a broad electron fraction distribution with a lower average value (0.16).

authors: Ricard Ardevol-Pulpillo, H.-Thomas Janka, Oliver Just, Andreas Bauswein
topic: We present a new, computationally efficient, energy-integrated approximation for neutrino effects in hot and dense astrophysical environments such as supernova cores and compact binary mergers and their remnants. Our new method, termed ILEAS for Improved Leakage-Equilibration-Absorption Scheme, improves the lepton-number and energy losses of traditional leakage descriptions by a novel prescription of the diffusion time-scale based on a detailed energy integral of the flux-limited diffusion equation. The leakage module is supplemented by a neutrino-equilibration treatment that ensures the proper evolution of the total lepton number and medium plus neutrino energies as well as neutrino-pressure effects in the neutrino-trapping domain. Moreover, we employ a simple and straightforwardly applicable ray-tracing algorithm for including re-absorption of escaping neutrinos especially in the decoupling layer and during the transition to semi-transparent conditions. ILEAS is implemented on a three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian grid with a minimum of free and potentially case-dependent parameters and exploits the basic physics constraints that should be fulfilled in the neutrino-opaque and free-streaming limits.

topic:  Simulations of r-process nucleosynthesis, so far fail to account for the observed over-enhancement of actinides. In this work, we investigate actinide production in the dynamical ejecta of a neutron star merger and explore if varying levels of neutron richness can reproduce the actinide boost. We also investigate the sensitivity of actinide production on nuclear physics properties: fission distribution, beta-decay, and mass model. For most cases, the actinides are over-produced in our models if the initial conditions are sufficiently neutron-rich for fission cycling. We find that actinide production can be so robust in the dynamical ejecta that an additional lanthanide-rich, actinide-poor component is necessary in order to match observations of actinide-boost stars. We present a simple actinide-dilution model that folds in estimated contributions from two nucleosynthetic sites within a merger event. Our study suggests that while the dynamical ejecta of a neutron star merger is a likely production site for the formation of actinides, a significant contribution from another site or sites (e.g., the neutron star merger accretion disk wind) is required to explain abundances of r-process-enhanced, metal-poor stars.

This calculation is performed using the same EoS for merger components and for low spin prior case. It is found from the computations of tidal deformability parameters that soft to moderately stiff equations of state are allowed by the 50\% and 90\% credible regions obtained from the gravitational wave observation of binary neutron star merger GW170817, whereas the stiffest hadron-quark EoS which lies above the upper 90% limit, is ruled out. A correlation among the tidal deformabilities and masses is found to exist as already predicted. Furthermore moments of inertia and quadrupole moments of merger components of GW170817 are estimated.

We then combine the H0 values from all the galaxies to provide a final measurement of H0. We explore the dependence of our results on the thresholds by which galaxies are included in our sample, as well as the impact of weighting the galaxies by stellar mass and star-formation rate.

In this paper, we propose that the polarimetric observation can be a useful tool to study the early macronova emissions.

The degree of polarization can show a large value of \sim 3\% for the first 0.3−1 hour.

authors: L. Jens Papenfort, Roman Gold, Luciano Rezzolla
topic:  we investigate the dynamics, gravitational-wave emission, and nucleosynthetic yields of numerous eccentric binary neutron-star mergers having different equations of state. For each equation of state we vary the orbital properties around th we couple the dynamical ejecta output from the simulations to the nuclear-reaction network code \texttt{SkyNet} to compute nucleosynthetic yields and compare to the corresponding results in the case of a quasi-circular merger. We find that the amount and velocity of dynamically ejected material is always much larger than in the quasi-circular case, reaching maximal valuese threshold of immediate merger, as well as the binary mass ratio. At the same time, the properties of this material are rather insensitive to the details of the orbit. urthermore, while the composition of the ejected matter depends on the orbital parameters and on the equation of state, the relative nucleosynthetic yields do not, thus indicating that kilonova signatures could provide information on the orbital properties of dynamically captured neutron-star binaries.

topic: We present detailed chemical abundances of three new bright (V ~ 11), extremely metal-poor ([Fe/H] ~ -3.0), r-process-enhanced halo red giants based on high-resolution, high-S/N Magellan/MIKE spectra. We measured abundances for 20-25 neutron-capture elements in each of our stars. All three stars show remarkable agreement with the scaled solar r-process pattern for elements above Ba, consistent with enrichment of the birth gas cloud by a neutron star merger. The abundances for Sr, Y, and Zr, however, deviate from the scaled solar pattern. This indicates that more than one distinct r-process site might be responsible for the observed neutron-capture element abundance pattern. Thorium was detected in J1432-4125 and J2005-3057. Age estimates for J1432-4125 and J2005-3057 were adopted from one of two sets of initial production ratios each by assuming the stars are old.

title: Radioactive Heating and Late Time Kilonova Light Curves
authors: Daniel Kasen, Jennifer Barnes
topic:  The luminosity of kilonova light curves depends on the efficiency with which beta-decay electrons are thermalized in the ejecta. Here we derive a simple analytic solution for thermalization by calculating how electrons accumulate in the ejecta and lose energy adiabatically and via plasma losses. We find that the time-dependent thermalization efficiency is well described by [law] is a function of the ejecta mass and velocity. For a statistical distribution of r-process isotopes with radioactive power [law] the late time kilonova luminosity asymptotes to [law] depends super-linearly on the ejecta mass [law] If a kilonova is instead powered by a single dominate isotope, we show that the late time luminosity can deviate substantially from the underlying exponential decay and eventually become brighter than the instantaneous radioactivity due to the accumulation of trapped electrons. Applied to the kilonova associated with the gravitational wave source GW170817, these results imply that a possible steepening of the observed light curve at ≳7 days is unrelated to thermalization effects and instead could mark the onset of translucency in a high opacity component of ejecta. The analytic results should be convenient for estimating the properties of observed kilonovae and assessing the potential late time detectability of future events.

topic: While long-duration GRBs originate from massive stars and thus are located near their stellar nurseries, binary neutron stars may merge on much longer timescales, and thus may have had time to migrate appreciably. The strength and character of the electromagnetic afterglow emission of binary neutron star mergers is a sensitive function of the circum-merger environment. Though the explosion sites of short GRBs have been explored in the literature, the question has yet to be fully addressed in its cosmological context. We present cosmological simulations following the evolution of a galaxy cluster including star formation combined with binary population synthesis models to self-consistently track the locations and environmental gas densities of compact binary merger sites throughout the cosmic web. We present probability distributions for densities as a function of redshift and discuss model sensitivity to population synthesis model assumptions.

We develop a simple formula that distinguishes between merger outcomes and predicts the post-merger remnant mass, validated with 75 simulations.

title: Late afterglows of GW/GRB 170817A
authors: Houri Ziaeepour
topic: In a previous work we used a phenomenological formulation of relativistic shocks and synchrotron emission to analyse the prompt gamma-ray emission of GW/GRB 170817A. Here we use the same model to analyse late afterglows of this event. The main goal is to see whether synchrotron emission alone can explain late afterglows. This is true, if the synchrotron self-absorption of radio emission and extinction of optical/IR photons are taken into account. Alternatively, an additional source of X-ray is necessary to explain the data. These conclusions are independent of the model used here and can be deduced directly from data. We also show that at the time of its encounter with circumburst material the outflow could have been still mildly magnetized.

topic: Here we show that GRB150101B was an analogue of GRB170817A located at a cosmological distance. GRB 150101B was a faint short duration GRB characterized by a bright optical counterpart and a long-lived X-ray afterglow. These properties are unusual for standard short GRBs and are instead consistent with an explosion viewed off-axis: the optical light is produced by a luminous kilonova component, while the observed X-rays trace the GRB afterglow viewed at an angle of \sim 13 degrees. Our findings suggest that these properties could be common among future electromagnetic counterparts of GW sources.

title: Jet Dynamics in Compact Object Mergers: GW170817 Likely had a Successful Jet
authors: Paul C. Duffell, Eliot Quataert, Daniel Kasen, Hannah Klion
topic: We use relativistic hydrodynamic numerical calculations to study the interaction between a jet and a homologous outflow produced dynamically during binary neutron star mergers. We quantify how the thermal energy supplied by the jet to the ejecta and the ability of a jet to escape the homologous ejecta depend on the parameters of the jet engine and the ejecta. For collimated jets initiated at early times compared to the engine duration, we show that successful breakout of the forward cocoon shock necessitates a jet that successfully escapes the ejecta. This is because the ejecta is expanding and absorbing thermal energy, so that the forward shock from a failed jet stalls before it reaches the edge of the ejecta. This conclusion can be circumvented only for very energetic wide angle jets, with parameters that are uncomfortable given short-duration GRB observations. For successful jets, we find two regimes of jet breakout from the ejecta, early breakout on timescales shorter than the engine duration, and late breakout well after the engine shuts off. A late breakout can explain the observed delay between gravitational waves and gamma rays in GW 170817.

authors: Kenta Hotokezaka, Ehud Nakar, Ore Gottlieb, Samaya Nissanke, Kento Masuda, Gregg Hallinan, Kunal P. Mooley, Adam. T. Deller
topic: In this analysis, the degeneracy in the GW signal between the source distance and the weakly constrained viewing angle dominated the H0 measurement uncertainty. ecently, Mooley et al. (2018) obtained tight constraints on the viewing angle using high angular resolution imaging of the radio counterpart of GW170817. Here we obtain a significantly improved measurement H0=68.9+4.7−4.6 km/s/Mpc by using these new radio observations, combined with the previous GW and EM data. We estimate that 15 more localized GW170817-like events (comparable signal-to-noise ratio, favorable orientation), having radio images and light curve data, will potentially bring resolution to the tension between the Planck and Cepheid-supernova measurements, as compared to 50-100 GW events without such data.

topic: We present a covariant ray tracing algorithm for computing high-resolution neutrino distributions in general relativistic numerical spacetimes with hydrodynamical sources. Our formulation treats the very important effect of elastic scattering of neutrinos off of nuclei and nucleons (changing the neutrino's direction but not energy) by incorporating estimates of the background neutrino fields. Background fields provide information about the spectra and intensities of the neutrinos scattered into each ray. These background fields may be taken from a low-order moment simulation or be ignored, in which case the method reduces to a standard state-of-the-art ray tracing formulation. The method handles radiation in regimes spanning optically thick to optically thin.

authors: Y. Zhu, R. T. Wollaeger, N. Vassh, et al
topic: We have performed dynamical nucleosynthesis calculations and identified a single isotope, 254Cf, which has a particularly high impact on the brightness of electromagnetic transients associated with mergers on the order of 15 to 250 days. This is due to the anomalously long half-life of this isotope and the efficiency of fission thermalization compared to other nuclear channels. We estimate the fission fragment yield of this nucleus and outline the astrophysical conditions under which 254Cf has the greatest impact to the light curve. Future observations in the middle-IR which are bright during this regime could indicate the production of actinide nucleosynthesis.

authors: K. P. Mooley, A. T. Deller, O. Gottlieb, E. Nakar, G. Hallinan, S. Bourke , D.A. Frail, A. Horesh, A. Corsi, K. Hotokezaka
topic: To date, various models have been proposed to explain the afterglow emission, including a choked-jet cocoon and a successful-jet cocoon (a.k.a. structured jet). However, the observational data have remained inconclusive as to whether GW170817 launched a successful relativistic jet. Here we show, through Very Long Baseline Interferometry, that the compact radio source associated with GW170817 exhibits superluminal motion between two epochs at 75 and 230 days post-merger. This measurement breaks the degeneracy between the models and indicates that, while the early-time radio emission was powered by a wider-angle outflow (cocoon), the late-time emission was most likely dominated by an energetic and narrowly-collimated jet, with an opening angle of \less 5 degrees, and observed from a viewing angle of about 20 degrees.

title: From Nuclei to the Cosmos: Tracing Heavy-Element Production with the Oldest Stars
authors: Anna Frebel
topic: Old stars found in the Milky Way and its dwarf satellite galaxies can provide answers because they preserve clean elemental patterns of the nucleosynthesis processes that operated some 13 billion years ago. This enables the reconstruction of the chemical evolution of the elements. Here we focus on the astrophysical signatures of heavy neutron-capture elements made in the s-, i- and r-process found in old stars. A highlight is the recently discovered r-process galaxy Reticulum II that was apparently enriched by a neutron star merger. These results show that old stars in dwarf galaxies provide a novel means to constrain the astrophysical site of the r-process, ushering in much needed progress on this major outstanding question.

title: Radio sky maps of the GRB 170817A afterglow from simulations
authors: Jonathan Zrake, Xiaoyi Xie, Andrew MacFadyen
topic: We present synthetic radio images of the GRB170817A afterglow, computed from moving-mesh hydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star merger outflows. Having expanded for nearly a year, the merger remnant is expected to subtend roughly 5 milli-arcseconds (mas) on the sky, potentially resolvable by very long baseline radio imaging techniques. Any observations revealing the radio centroid to be offset from the line-of-site to the merger would be the smoking gun of a jetted outflow. We find that in both scenarios, the centroid exhibits superluminal proper motion away from the merger site at roughly 4 - 10 mas per day for at least the first 300 days. We argue that a successful strategy for differentiating among the explosion models will need to include multiple observations over the coming months - years. In particular, we find the time at which the centroid attains its maximum offset, and begins heading back toward the merger site, is considerably later if the jet was choked.

title: Unveiling the Engines of Fast Radio Bursts, Super-Luminous Supernovae, and Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Ben Margalit, Brian D. Metzger, Edo Berger, Matt Nicholl, Tarraneh Eftekhari, Raffaella Margutti
topic: However, a barrier to direct confirmation of the magnetar hypothesis is the challenge of directly observing non-thermal emission from the central engine at early times (when it is most powerful and thus detectable) due to the dense surrounding ejecta. We present CLOUDY calculations of the time-dependent evolution of the temperature and ionization structure of expanding supernova or merger ejecta due to photo-ionization by a magnetar engine, in order to study the escape of X-rays (absorbed by neutral gas) and radio waves (absorbed by ionized gas), as well as to assess the evolution of the local dispersion measure due to photo-ionization. We find that ionization breakout does not occur if the engine's ionizing luminosity decays rapidly, and that X-rays typically escape the oxygen-rich ejecta of SLSNe only on \sim 100yr timescales, consistent with current X-ray non-detections. We apply these results to constrain engine-driven models for the binary NS merger GW170817 and the luminous transient ASASSN-15lh.

title: On GW170817 and the Galactic Binary Neutron Star Population
authors: Chris Pankow
topic: Electromagnetic observations and model fitting of the ejecta properties from the subsequent kilonova detection provided values of the ejecta mass from the merger. These values, when combined with the gravitational-wave measurement disfavors an equal-mass configuration, with the level of disagreement dependent on the assumed amount of ejecta mass of dynamical origin. Within the confines of our own galaxy, several binary neutron star systems along with measurements of their component masses have been made. If those distributions are indicative of a universal distribution, the joint measurement of the component masses of GW170817 represents an outlier. This tension is not easily resolvable from physical arguments, as the proposed pathways which form binary neutron stars do not often produce very asymmetrical pairs. Even accounting for the uncertainty associated with the total mass of the dynamical ejecta, this tension suggests that the distribution of binary neutron star masses in the galaxy is not indicative of those in other galaxies.

In this letter, we perform a 2-dimensional radiative transfer simulation for a kilonova/macronova consistently taking the interplay of multiple ejecta components into account. We show that the lightcurves and photospheric velocity of SSS17a can be reproduced naturally by a setup consistent with the prediction of the numerical-relativity simulations.

title: Constraining the Environmental Properties of FRB 131104 Using the Unified Dynamical Afterglow Model
authors: Zong-Kai Peng, Shan-Qin Wang, Liang-Duan Liu, Zi-Gao Dai, Hai Yu
topic:  In this paper, we adopt a unified afterglow model that takes into account the non-relativistic effect and jet effect and use the upper limits of four bands (5.5 GHz, 7.5 GHz, U-band, and X-ray) to obtain more stringent constraints on the parameter space spanned by \epsilon_B and n. We thus suggest that FRB 131104/Swift J0644.5-5111 might originate from a black hole-neutron star merger event. Moreover, we calculate multi-band emissions from a kilonova powered by the radioactivity of r-process elements synthesized in the ejected neutron-rich material and find that the U-band emission from the putative kilonova is significantly lower than the upper limit of the observations.

topic: We present late-time radio observations of GW170817, the first binary neutron star merger discovered through gravitational waves by the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors. Our observations, carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, were optimized to detect polarized radio emission, and thus to constrain the linear polarization fraction of GW170817. At an epoch of \sim 244 days after the merger, we rule out linearly polarized emission above a fraction of ~1\2 \% at a frequency of 2.8 GHz (99\% confidence). Within the structured jet scenario (a.k.a. successful jet plus cocoon system) for GW170817, the derived upper-limit on the radio continuum linear polarization fraction strongly constrains the magnetic field configuration in the shocked ejecta. We show that our results for GW170817 are compatible with the low level of linear polarization found in afterglows of cosmological long gamma-ray bursts. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of future expectations for the study of radio counterparts of binary neutron star mergers identified by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.

title: Evaluating radiation transport errors in merger simulations using a Monte-Carlo algorithm
authors: Francois Foucart, Matthew D. Duez, Lawerence E. Kidder, Ronny Nguyen, Harald P. Pfeiffer, Mark A. Scheel
topic: Unfortunately, Boltzmann's equations of radiation transport remain too costly to be evolved directly in merger simulations. Simulations rely instead on approximate transport algorithms with unquantified modeling errors. In this paper, we use for the first time a time-dependent general relativistic Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm to solve Boltzmann's equations and estimate important properties of the neutrino distribution function \sim 10ms after a neutron star merger. We do not fully couple the MC algorithm to the fluid evolution, but use a short evolution of the merger remnant to critically assess errors in our approximate gray two-moment transport scheme. We demonstrate that the analytical closure used by the moment scheme is highly inaccurate in the polar regions, but performs well elsewhere. While the average energy of polar neutrinos is reasonably well captured by the two-moment scheme, estimates for the neutrino energy become less accurate at lower latitudes. The two-moment formalism also overestimates the density of neutrinos in the polar regions by \sim 50%, and underestimates the neutrino pair-annihilation rate at the poles by factors of 2-3. Although the latter is significantly more accurate than one might have expected before this study, our results indicate that predictions for the properties of polar outflows and for the creation of a baryon-free region at the poles are likely to be affected by errors in the two-moment scheme, thus limiting our ability to reliably model kilonovae and gamma-ray bursts.

We also put forward alternative strong (\sim G) magnetic field scenarios able to support this emission. For such stronger fields, the photo-disintegration of non-thermal nuclei within the source is considered, and a bottleneck period of \sim 5-30 days is found when this process peaks. We find that this class of source is in principle able to support the population of cosmic rays detected at Earth below the "ankle".

authors: Nicola Giacobbo, Michela Mapelli
topic: We investigate the impact of progenitor's metallicity, of the common-envelope parameter α and of the natal kicks on the properties of DNSs, BHNSs and BHBs. We find that neutron-star (NS) masses in DNSs span from 1.1 to 2.0 Msun, with a preference for light NSs, while NSs in merging BHNSs have mostly large masses (1.3−2.0 Msun). BHs in merging BHNSs are preferentially low mass (5−15 Msun). BH masses in merging BHBs strongly depend on the progenitor's metallicity and span from \sim 5 to \sim 45 Msun. The local merger rate density of both BHNSs and BHBs derived from our simulations is consistent with the values reported by the LVC in all our simulations. In contrast, the local merger rate density of DNSs matches the value inferred from the LVC only if low natal kicks are assumed. This result adds another piece to the intricate puzzle of natal kicks and DNS formation.

We investigate the impact of ECSNe on the formation of DNSs by means of population synthesis simulations.

Finally, we have considered the extreme case in which all neutron stars receive a low natal kick. In this case, the number of DNSs increases by a factor of ten and the percentage of merging DNSs which went through an ECSN is significantly suppressed.

Using the final observation as a template, we uncover a source at the position of GW170817 at 4.5 micron with a brightness of 22.9+/-0.3 AB mag at 43 days and 23.8+/-0.3 AB mag at 74 days (the uncertainty is dominated by systematics from the image subtraction. The measured brightness is dimmer by a factor of about 2-3 times compared to our previously published kilonova model, which is based on UV, optical, and near-IR data at less 30 days. However, the observed fading rate and color are consistent with our model. We suggest that the discrepancy is likely due to a transition to the nebular phase, or a reduced thermalization efficiency at such late time. Using the Spitzer data as a guide, we briefly discuss the prospects of observing future binary neutron star mergers with Spitzer (in LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 3) and the James Webb Space Telescope (in LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 4 and beyond).

authors: Maxim Lyutikov (Purdue), Serguei Komissarov (Leeds), Lorenzo Sironi (Columbia), Oliver Porth (Goethe-Universitat)
topic: Using analytical and numerical methods (fluid and particle-in-cell simulations) we study a number of model problems involving merger of magnetic flux tubes in relativistic magnetically-dominated plasma. Mergers of current-carrying flux tubes (exemplified by the two dimensional `ABC' structures) and zero total current magnetic flux tubes are considered.  We identify two stages of particle acceleration during flux mergers: (i) fast explosive prompt X-point collapse and (ii) ensuing island merger. The fastest acceleration occurs during the initial catastrophic X-point collapse, with the reconnection electric field of the order of the magnetic field. During the X-point collapse particles are accelerated by charge-starved electric fields, which can reach (and even exceed) values of the local magnetic field. The explosive stage of reconnection produces non-thermal power-law tails with slopes that depend on the average magnetization. The X-point collapse stage is followed by magnetic island merger that dissipates a large fraction of the initial magnetic energy in a regime of forced magnetic reconnection, further accelerating the particles, but proceeds at a slower reconnection rate.

title: Free Neutron Ejection From Shock Breakout in Binary Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Ayako Ishii, Toshikazu Shigeyama, Masaomi Tanaka
topic: It is expected that some of such neutrons having avoided capturing positrons remain as free neutrons even after disappearance of electron-positron pairs. To investigate how many free neutrons can be ejected from merging neutron stars, we performed special-relativistic Lagrangian hydrodynamics computation with simplified models of this phenomenon in which a spherically symmetric shock wave propagates in the hydrostatic envelope and emerge from the surface. We systematically study a wide parameter space of the size of the merging neutron stars and the energy involved in the shock waves. As a result, it is found that the mass of remaining free neutron is \sim 10**-6 which is smaller than the previously expected by more than two orders of magnitude.  We briefly discuss the emission from the free neutron layer and estimate the luminosity in the optical band to be about

title: Fading of the X-ray Afterglow of Neutron Star Merger GW170817/GRB170817A at 260 days
authors: Melania Nynka, John J. Ruan, Daryl Haggard, Phil A. Evans
topic: We present new, deep Chandra observations of GW170817/GRB170817A at 260 days post-merger that reveal an X-ray flux and confirm that the X-ray light curve is now also fading. Through rigorous comparisons to previous Chandra observations of GW170817/GRB170817A, X-ray fading is detected between 160 and 260 days post-merger based on the X-ray data alone. We further constrain the X-ray photon index to steepen significance during this period, which disfavors the passing of the synchrotron cooling frequency through the X-ray band as the cause of the observed fading. These observations remain consistent with optically thin synchrotron afterglow emission. If this afterglow emission arises from a quasi-spherical mildly relativistic outflow, the X-ray fading suggests that the outflow is now decelerating. Alternatively, if this afterglow arises from a successful off-axis structured jet, the X-ray fading suggests that emission from the jet core has already entered the line of sight.

title: Gamma-Ray Burst Optical Afterglows with Two-Component Jets: Polarization Evolution Revisited
authors: Mi-Xiang Lan, Xue-Feng Wu, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been widely argued to originate from binary compact object mergers or core collapses of massive stars. Jets from these systems may have two components, an inner, narrow sub-jet and an outer, wider sub-jet. Such a jet subsequently interacts with its ambient gas, leading to a reverse shock (RS) and a forward shock (FS). The magnetic field in the narrow sub-jet is very likely to be mixed by an ordered component and a random component during the afterglow phase. In this paper, we calculate light curves and polarization evolution of optical afterglows with this mixed magnetic field in the RS region of the narrow sub-jet in a two-component jet model. The resultant light curve has two peaks: an early peak arises from the narrow sub-jet and a late-time rebrightening is due to the wider sub-jet. We find the polarization degree (PD) evolution under such a mixed magnetic field confined in the shock plane is very similar to that under the purely ordered magnetic field condition

title: A Globular Cluster Luminosity Function Distance to NGC 4993 Hosting a Binary Neutron Star Merger GW170817/GRB 170817A
authors: Myung Gyoon Lee, Jisu Kang, Myungshin Im
topic: NGC 4993 hosts a binary neutron star merger emitting gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves, GW170817/GRB 170817A. The distance to this galaxy is not well established. We select the globular cluster candidates from the Hubble Space Telescope/ACS F606W images of NGC 4993 in the archive, using the structural parameters of the detected sources.  Also the luminosity function of these candidates is fit well by a Gaussian function. We derive an extinction-corrected turnover Vega magnitude in the luminosity function of the globular clusters we derive a distance to NGC 4993, d = 41.65 plus minus 3.00 Mpc. The systematic error of this method can be as large as  0.3 mag. This value is consistent with the previous distance estimates based on the fundamental plane relation and the gravitational wave method in the literature. The distance in this study can be used to constrain the values of the parameters including the inclination angle of the binary system in the models of gravitational wave analysis.

Our simulations largely vindicate formulae for ejecta properties but do not find the expected dependence of disk mass on neutron star compaction. We track the early evolution of the accretion disk, largely driven by shocking and fallback inflow, and do find notable equation of state effects on the structure of this early-time, neutrino-bright disk.

title: Numerical simulations of the jet dynamics and synchrotron radiation of binary neutron star merger event GW170817/GRB170817A
authors: Xiaoyi Xie, Jonathan Zrake, Andrew MacFadyen
topic: We present numerical simulations of energetic flows propagating through the debris cloud of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger. Starting from the scale of the central engine, we use a moving-mesh hydrodynamics code to simulate the complete dynamical evolution of the produced relativistic jets. We compute synchrotron emission directly from the simulations and present multi-band light curves of the early (sub-day) through late (weeks to years) afterglow stages. Our work systematically compares two distinct models for the central engine, referred to as the narrow and wide engine scenario, which is associated with a successful structured jet and a quasi-isotropic explosion respectively. The rapidly declining signature may be detectable for future BNS mergers during the first minutes to day following the GW chirp. Furthermore, its non-detection for the GRB170817A event may disfavor the wide, quasi-isotropic explosion model.

authors: Soumi De, Daniel Finstad, James M. Lattimer, Duncan A. Brown, Edo Berger, Christopher M. Biwer
topic: We use gravitational-wave observations of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 to explore the tidal deformabilities and radii of neutron stars. We perform Bayesian parameter estimation with the source location and distance informed by electromagnetic observations. We also assume that the two stars have the same equation of state; we demonstrate that for stars with masses comparable to the component masses of GW170817, this is effectively implemented by assuming that the stars' dimensionless tidal deformabilities are determined by the binary's mass ratio. Our results are the first measurement of tidal deformability with a physical constraint on the star's equation of state and place the first lower bounds on the deformability and areal radii of neutron stars using gravitational waves.

title: What Powered the Optical Transient AT2017gfo Associated with GW170817?
authors: Shao-Ze Li, Liang-Duan Liu, Yun-Wei Yu, Bing Zhang
topic: The groundbreaking discovery of the optical transient AT2017gfo associated with GW170817 opens a unique opportunity to study the physics of double neutron star (NS) mergers. We argue that the standard interpretation of AT2017gfo as being powered by radioactive decays of r-process elements faces the challenge of simultaneously accounting for the peak luminosity and peak time of the event, as it is not easy to achieve the required high mass, and especially the low opacity of the ejecta required to fit the data. We consider energy injection from two types of the merger products: (1) a post-merger black hole powered by fallback accretion; and (2) a long-lived NS remnant. In the latter case, both early- and late-emission components can be well interpreted as due to energy injection from a spinning-down NS, with the required mass and opacity of the ejecta components well consistent with known numerical simulation results. We suggest that there is a strong indication that the merger product of GW170817 is a long-lived (supramassive or even permanently stable), low magnetic field NS. The result provides a stringent constraint on the equations of state of NSs.

title: Measuring the viewing angle of GW170817 with electromagnetic and gravitational waves
authors: Daniel Finstad, Soumi De, Duncan A. Brown, Edo Berger, Christopher M. Biwer
topic: Here, we use joint GW-EM observations to measure the viewing angle of GW170817, the angle between the binary's angular momentum and the line of sight. We combine a direct measurement of the distance to the host galaxy of GW170817 (NGC 4993) of 40.7\pm2.36 Mpc with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)/Virgo GW data and find that the viewing angle is 32+10−13\pm1.7 degrees (90\% confidence, statistical, and systematic errors). We place a conservative lower limit on the viewing angle of more then 13\deg, which is robust to the choice of prior. This measurement provides a constraint on models of the prompt \gamma-ray and radio/X-ray afterglow emission associated with the merger; for example, it is consistent with the off-axis viewing angle inferred for a structured jet model.

title: Production of Mo and Ru isotopes in neutrino-driven winds: implications for solar abundances and presolar grains
authors: Julia Bliss, Almudena Arcones, Yong-Zhong Qian
topic: The origin of the so-called p-isotopes 92,94[Mo] and 96,98[Ru] in the solar system remains a mystery as several astrophysical scenarios fail to account for them. In addition, data on presolar silicon carbide grains of type X (SiC X) exhibit peculiar Mo patterns, especially for 95,97[Mo]. We examine production of Mo and Ru isotopes in neutrino-driven winds associated with core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) over a wide range of conditions. We find that proton-rich winds can make dominant contributions to the solar abundance of 98[Ru], significant contributions to those of 96[Ru] (less 40%) and 92Mo (less 27%), and relatively minor contributions to that of 94[Mo] (less 14%). In contrast, neutron-rich winds make negligible contributions to the solar abundances of 92,94[Mo] and cannot produce 96,98[Ru]. However, we show that some neutron-rich winds can account for the peculiar Mo patterns in SiC X grains. Our results can be generalized if conditions similar to those studied here are also obtained for other types of ejecta in either CCSNe or neutron star mergers.

title: Short gamma-ray burst central engines
authors: Riccardo Ciolfi
topic: Growing evidence connects the progenitor systems of the short-hard subclass of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to the merger of compact object binaries composed by two neutron stars (NSs) or by a NS and a black hole (BH). However, the mechanisms through which a BNS or NS-BH merger remnant would power a collimated outflow are much less constrained. Understanding the properties of the remnant systems and whether they can provide the right conditions for jet production has been a main driver of the great effort devoted to study BNS and NS-BH mergers, and still represents a real challenge from both the physical and the computational point of view. One fundamental open question concerns the nature of the central engine itself. Here we elaborate on this key aspect, considering three different scenarios to explain the SGRB phenomenology based on different hypotheses on the nature of the merger remnant. Then, we discuss the basic properties of GRB 170817A and how this event would fit within the different frameworks of the above scenarios, under the assumption that it was or was not a canonical SGRB.

topic: However, observations of metal-poor stars with highly-enhanced r-process elements have revealed abundance patterns suggesting that multiple sites may be involved. To address this issue, and to advance our understanding of the r-process, we have initiated an extensive search for bright (V lenss 13.5), very metal-poor ([Fe/H] less then 2) stars in the Milky Way halo exhibiting strongly-enhanced r-process signatures. This paper presents the first sample collected in the Southern Hemisphere, using the echelle spectrograph on du Pont 2.5m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Of those, 12 stars are strongly enhanced in heavy r-process elements (r-II), 42 stars show moderate enhancements of heavy r-process material (r-I), and 20 stars exhibit low abundances of the heavy r-process elements and higher abundances of the light r-process elements relative to the heavy ones (limited-r). This search is more successful at finding r-process-enhanced stars compared to previous searches, primarily due to a refined target selection procedure that focuses on red giants.

authors: G. Fiorella Burgio, Anthea F. Fantina
topic:  We review the current status of the EoS for compact objects, that have been studied with both ab-initio many-body approaches and phenomenological models. We limit ourselves to the description of EoSs with purely nucleonic degrees of freedom, disregarding the appearance of strange baryonic matter and/or quark matter. We compare the theoretical predictions with different data coming from both nuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations. Combining the complementary information thus obtained greatly enriches our insights into the dense nuclear matter properties. Current challenges in the description of the EoS are also discussed, mainly focusing on the model dependence of the constraints extracted from either experimental or observational data (specifically, concerning the symmetry energy), the lack of a consistent and rigorous many-body treatment at zero and finite temperature of the matter encountered in compact stars (e.g. problem of cluster formation and extension of the EoS to very high temperatures), the role of nucleonic three-body forces, and the dependence of the direct URCA processes on the EoS.

title: The demographics of neutron star - white dwarf mergers: rates, delay-time distributions and progenitors
authors: S. Toonen, H.B. Perets, A.P. Igoshev, E. Michaely, Y. Zenati
topic: The mergers of neutron stars (NSs) and white dwarfs (WDs) could give rise to explosive transients, potentially observable with current and future transient surveys. However, the expected properties and distribution of such events is not well understood. Here we characterize the rates of such events, their delay time distribution, their progenitors and the distribution of their properties. We use binary populations synthesis models and consider a wide range of initial conditions and physical processes. We find that the majority of NS-WD mergers are born in systems in which mass-transfer played an important role, and the WD formed before the NS. For the majority of the mergers the WDs have a carbon-oxygen composition (60-80%) and most of the rest are with oxygen-neon WDs. The rates of NS-WD mergers are in the range of 3-15% of the type Ia supernovae (SNe) rate. Their delay time distribution is very similar to that of type Ia SNe, but slightly biased towards earlier times. They typically explode in young 0.1-1Gyr environments, but have a tail distribution extending to long, Gyrs-timescales.

title: Shock acceleration of electrons and synchrotron emission from the dynamical ejecta of neutron star mergers
authors: Shiu-Hang Lee, Keiichi Maeda, Norita Kawanaka
topic: As analogous to supernovae and supernova remnants, the NSM dynamical ejecta are expected to produce non-thermal emission by electrons accelerated at a shock wave. In this paper, we present expected radio and X-ray signals by this mechanism, taking into account non-linear diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) and magnetic field amplification. We suggest that the NSM has a unique nature as a DSA site, where the seed relativistic electrons are abundantly provided by the decays of r-process elements. The signal is predicted to peak at a few 100 - 1,000 days after the merger, determined by the balance between the decrease of the number of seed electrons and the increase of the dissipated kinetic energy due to the shock expansion. While the resulting flux can ideally reach to the maximum flux expected from near-equipartition, the available kinetic energy dissipation rate of the NSM ejecta limits the detectability of such a signal. It is likely that the radio and X-ray emission are overwhelmed by other mechanisms (e.g., an off-axis jet) for an observer placed to a jet direction (i.e., for GW170817). On the other hand, for an off-axis observer, to be discovered once a number of NSMs are identified, the dynamical ejecta component is predicted to dominate the non-thermal emission. While the detection of this signal is challenging even with near-future facilities, this potentially provides a robust probe of the creation of r-process elements in NSMs.

title: Long-lived Remnants from Binary Neutron Star Mergers
authors: David Radice, Albino Perego, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Bing Zhang
topic: We find that gravitational-wave (GW) emission is not able to remove this excess angular momentum within the time over which solid body rotation should be achieved. Instead, we argue that the excess angular momentum could be carried away by massive winds. Long-lived merger remnants are also formed with larger gravitational masses than those of rigidly-rotating NSs having the same number of baryons. The excess mass is likely radiated in the form of neutrinos. The evolution of long-lived remnants on the viscous timescale is thus determined by the interplay of finite-temperature effects, mass ejection, and neutrinos with potentially dramatic consequences for the remnants' properties and stability. We also provide an empirical fit for the spin of the remnant at the end of its viscous evolution as a function of its final mass, and we discuss the implications for the magnetar model of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). Finally, we investigate the possible electromagnetic signatures associated with the viscous ejecta. Massive outflows possibly resulting from the formation of long-lived remnants would power unusually bright, blue kilonova counterparts to GW events and SGRBs whose detection would provide smoking gun evidence for the formation of long-lived remnants.

title: Central Engine-Powered Bright X-ray Flares in Short Gamma-Ray Bursts: A Hint of Black Hole-Neutron Star Merger?
authors: Hui-Jun Mu, Wei-Min Gu, Jirong Mao, Shu-Jin Hou, Da-Bin Lin, Tong Liu
topic: Short gamma-ray bursts may originate from the merger of double neutron stars (NS) or that of a black hole (BH) and an NS. We propose that the bright X-ray flare related to the central engine reactivity may hint a BH-NS merger, since such a merger can provide more fall-back materials and therefore a more massive accretion disk than the NS-NS merger. Based on the observed 49 short bursts with Swift/X-ray Telescope follow-up observations, we find that three bursts have bright X-ray flares, among which three flares from two bursts are probably related to the central engine reactivity. We argue that these two bursts may originate from the BH-NS merger rather than the NS-NS merger. Our suggested link between the central engine-powered bright X-ray flare and the BH-NS merger event can be checked by the future gravitational wave detections from advanced LIGO and Virgo.

title: Bimodal distribution of short gamma-ray bursts: evidence for two distinct types of short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Y. B. Yu, L. B. Li, B. Li, J. J. Geng, Y. F. Huang
topic: Recently, GRB 170817A was confirmed to be associated with GW 170817, which was produced by a neutron star - neutron star merger. It indicates that at least some short gamma-ray bursts come from binary neutron star mergers. Theoretically, it is widely accepted that short gamma-ray bursts can be produced by two distinctly different mechanisms, binary neutron star mergers and neutron star - black hole mergers. These two kinds of bursts should be different observationally due to their different trigger mechanisms. Motivated by this idea, we collect a universal data set constituted of 51 short gamma-ray bursts observed by Swift/BAT, among which 14 events have extended emission component. We study the observational features of these 51 events statistically. It is found that our samples are consisted of two distinct groups. They clearly show a bimodal distribution when their peak photon fluxes at 15-150 keV band are plotted against the corresponding fluences. Most interestingly, all the 14 short bursts with extended emission lie in a particular region

title: Electrical Resistivity and Hall Effect in Binary Neutron-Star Mergers
authors: Arus Harutyunyan, Antonios Nathanail, Luciano Rezzolla, Armen Sedrakian
topic: We examine the range of rest-mass densities, temperatures and magnetic fields involved in simulations of binary neutron-star mergers and identify the conditions under which the ideal-magnetohydrodynamics approximation breaks down and hence the magnetic-field decay should be accounted for. We use recent calculations of the conductivities of warm correlated plasma in envelopes of compact stars and find that the magnetic-field decay timescales are much larger than the characteristic timescales of the merger process for lengthscales down to a meter. Because these are smaller than the currently available resolution in numerical simulations, the ideal-magnetohydrodynamics approximation is effectively valid for all realistic simulations. At the same time, we find that the Hall effect can be important at low densities and low temperatures, where it can induce a non-dissipative rearrangement of the magnetic field. Finally, we mark the region in temperature and density where the hydrodynamic description breaks down.

authors: Tim Dietrich, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Bernd Bruegmann, Wolfgang Tichy
topic: Numerical relativity simulations are the only tool to describe the binary's merger dynamics in the regime when speeds are largest and gravity is strongest. In this work we report state-of-the-art binary neutron star simulations for irrotational (non-spinning) and spinning configurations. The main use of these simulations is to model the gravitational-wave signal. Key numerical requirements are the understanding of the convergence properties of the numerical data and a detailed error budget. The simulations have been performed on different HPC clusters, they use multiple grid resolutions, and are based on eccentricity reduced quasi-circular initial data. We obtain convergent waveforms with phase errors of 0.5-1.5 rad accumulated over approximately 12 orbits to merger. The waveforms have been used for the construction of a phenomenological waveform model which has been applied for the analysis of the recent binary neutron star detection. Additionally, we show that the data can also be used to test other state-of-the-art semi-analytical waveform models.

title: Gamma Ray Bursts. Progenitors, accretion in the central engine, jet acceleration mechanisms
authors: Agnieszka Janiuk, Kostas Sapountzis 
topic: The collapsar model was proposed to explain the long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), while the short GRBs are associated with the mergers of compact objects. In the first case, mainly the energetics of the events is consistent with the proposed progenitor models, while the duration, time variability, as well as the afterglow emission may shed some light on the detailed properties of the collapsing massive stars.  For long ones, the rotation of the progenitor star is a key property in order to support accretion over relatively long activity periods, and also to sustain the rotation of the black hole itself. The latter is responsible for ejection of the relativistic jets, which are powered due to the extraction of the BH rotational energy, mitigated by the accretion torus and magnetic fields. The jets must break through the stellar envelope though, which poses a question on the efficiency of this process. Similar mechanisms of powering the jet ejection may act in short GRBs, which in this case may freely propagate through the interstellar medium. The power of the jets launched from the rotating black hole is at first associated mostly with the magnetic Poynting flux, and then at large distances it is transferred to the kinetic and finally radiative energy of the expanding shells.

title: Tidal deformability from GW170817 as a direct probe of the neutron star radius
authors: Carolyn Raithel, Feryal Özel, Dimitrios Psaltis
topic: We report here on a new simplification that arises in the effective tidal deformability of the binary, when the chirp mass is specified. We find that, in this case, the effective tidal deformability of the binary is surprisingly independent of the component masses of the individual neutron stars, and instead depends primarily on the ratio of the chirp mass to the neutron star radius. Thus, a measurement of the effective tidal deformability can be used to directly measure the neutron star radius. We find that the upper limit on the effective tidal deformability from GW170817 implies that the radius cannot be larger than \sim 13km, at the 90\% level, independent of the assumed masses for the component stars. The result can be applied generally, to probe the stellar radii in any neutron star-neutron star merger with a measured chirp mass

title: From gamma to Radio - The Electromagnetic Counterpart of GW 170817
authors: Ehud Nakar, Ore Gottlieb, Tsvi Piran, Mansi M. Kasliwal, Greg Hallinan 
topic: However, a closer examination of the sub-luminous γ-rays and the peculiar radio afterglow were inconsistent with this simple interpretation. Here we present results of 3D and 2D numerical simulations that follow the hydrodynamics and emission of the outflow from a neutron star merger form its ejection and up to its deceleration by the circum-merger medium. Our results show that the entire set of \gamma -rays, X-rays and radio observations can be explained by the emission from a mildly relativistic cocoon material (Lorentz factor \sim 2-5) that was formed while a jet propagated through the material ejected during the merger. The γ-rays are generated when the cocoon breaks out from the engulfing ejecta while the afterglow is produced by interaction of the cocoon matter with the interstellar medium. The strong early uv/optical signal may be a Lorentz boosted macronova/kilonova. The fate of the jet itself is currently unknown, but our full-EM models define a path to resolving between successful and choked jet scenarios, outputting coupled predictions for the image size, morphology, observed time-dependent polarization and light curve behavior from radio to X-ray. The predictive power of these models will prove key in interpreting the on-going multi-faceted observations of this unprecedented event.

title: Brightening X-ray/Optical/Radio Emission of GW170817/SGRB 170817A: Results of an Electron-Positron Wind from the Central Engine?
authors: Jin-Jun Geng, Zi-Gao Dai, Yong-Feng Huang, Xue-Feng Wu, Long-Biao Li, Bing Li, Yan-Zhi Meng
topic: Recent follow-up observations of the binary neutron star (NS) merging event GW170817/SGRB 170817A reveal that its X-ray/optical/radio emissions are brightening continuously up to \sim 100 days post-merger. This late-time brightening is unexpected from the kilonova model or the off-axis top-hat jet model for gamma-ray burst afterglows. In this paper, by assuming that the merger remnant is a long-lived NS, we propose that the interaction between an electron-positron-pair (e+e−) wind from the central NS and the jet could produce a long-lived reverse shock, from which a new emission component would rise and can interpret current observations well. We suggest that radio polarization observations of the brightening would help to distinguish our scenario from other scenarios. Future observations on a large sample of short gamma-ray burst afterglows or detections of GW signals from merger remnants would test our scenario.

authors: Dougal Dobie, David L. Kaplan, Tara Murphy, Emil Lenc, Kunal P. Mooley, Christene Lynch, Alessandra Corsi, Dale Frail, Mansi Kasliwal, Gregg Hallinan
topic: We present 2-9 GHz radio observations of GW170817 covering the period 125-200 days post-merger, taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Our observations demonstrate that the radio afterglow peaked at 149±2 days post-merger and is now declining in flux density. We see no evidence for evolution in the radio-only spectral index, which remains consistent with optically-thin synchrotron emission connecting the radio, optical, and X-ray regimes. The peak implies a total energy in the synchrotron-emitting component of a few 10^50 ergs . The temporal decay rate is most consistent with mildly- or non-relativistic material and we do not see evidence for a very energetic off-axis jet, but we cannot distinguish between a lower-energy jet and more isotropic emission.

authors: 
topic: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are usually suggested to be associated with mergers of compact binaries consisting of white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs), or black holes (BHs). We test these models by fitting the observational distributions in both redshift and isotropic energy of 22 Parkes FRBs, where, as usual, the rates of compact binary mergers (CBMs) are connected with cosmic star formation rates by a power-law distributed time delay. It is found that the observational distributions can well be produced by the CBM model with a characteristic delay time from several ten to several hundred Myr and an energy function index gamma 1.2 - 1.7 where a tentative fixed spectral index beta 0.8 is adopted for all FRBs.  This event rate, about an order of magnitude higher than the rates of NS-NS/NS-BH mergers, indicates that the most promising origin of FRBs in the CBM scenario could be mergers of WD-WD binaries. Here a massive WD could be produced since no FRB was found to be associated with a type Ia supernova. Alternatively, if actually all FRBs can repeat on a timescale much longer than the period of current observations, then they could also originate from a young active NS that forms from relatively rare NS-NS mergers and accretion-induced collapses of WD-WD binaries.

title: Off-axis afterglow light curves and images from 2D hydrodynamic simulations of double-sided GRB jets in a stratified external medium
authors: Jonathan Granot, Fabio De Colle, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
topic: Gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets are narrow, and thus typically point away from us. They are initially ultra-relativistic, causing their prompt γ-ray and early afterglow emission to be beamed away from us. However, as the jet gradually decelerates its beaming cone widens and eventually reaches our line of sight and the afterglow emission may be detected. Such orphan afterglows were not clearly detected so far. Nevertheless, they should be detected in upcoming optical or radio surveys, and it would be challenging to clearly distinguish between them and other types of transients. Therefore, we perform detailed, realistic calculations of the expected afterglow emission from GRB jets viewed at different angles from the jet's symmetry axis. The dynamics are calculated using 2D relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of jets propagating into different power-law external density profiles. ranging from a uniform ISM-like medium . to a stratified steady stellar-wind like profile k =2.  We calculate radio, optical and X-ray lightcurves, and the evolution of the radio afterglow image size, shape and flux centroid. This may help identify misaligned relativistic jets, whether initially ultra-relativistic and producing a GRB for observers within their beam, or (possibly intrinsically more common) moderately relativistic, in either (i) nearby supernovae Ib/c (some of which are associated with long duration GRBs), or (ii) in binary neutron star mergers, which may produce short duration GRBs, and may also be detected in gravitational waves (e.g. GW170827/GRB170817A with a weak prompt γ-ray emission may harbor an off-axis jet).

title: Light curves of a shock-breakout material and a relativistic off-axis jet from a Binary Neutron Star system
authors: N. Fraija, A.C. Caligula do E. S. Pedreira, P. Veres
topic: Binary neutron star mergers are believed to eject significant masses with a diverse range of velocities. Once these ejected materials begin to be decelerated by a homogeneous medium, relativistic electrons are mainly cooled down by synchrotron radiation, generating a multiwavelength long-lived afterglow. Analytic and numerical methods illustrate that the outermost matter, the merger shock-breakout material, can be parametrized by power-law velocity distributions [func]. Considering that the shock-breakout material is moving on-axis towards the observer and the relativistic jet off-axis, we compute the light curves during the relativistic and the lateral expansion phase. As a particular case, we successfully describe the X-ray, optical and radio light curves alongside the spectral energy distribution from the recently discovered gravitational-wave transient GW170817, when the merger shock-breakout material moves with mildly relativistic velocities near-Newtonian phase and the jet with relativistic velocities. Future electromagnetic counterpart observations of this binary system could be able to evaluate different properties of these light curves.

topic: We show that the commonly used criterion for beta equilibrium in neutrino-transparent dense nuclear matter becomes invalid as temperatures rise above 1 MeV. Such temperatures are attained in neutron star mergers. By numerically computing the relevant weak interaction rates we find that the correct criterion for beta equilibrium requires an isospin chemical potential that can be as large as 10-20 MeV, depending on the temperature at which neutrinos become trapped.

title: Synchrotron radiation from the fast tail of dynamical ejecta of neutron star mergers
authors: Kenta Hotokezaka, Kenta Kiuchi, Masaru Shibata, Ehud Nakar, Tsvi Piran 
topic: We find, using high resolution numerical relativistic simulations, that the tail of the dynamical ejecta of neutron star mergers extends to mildly relativistic velocities faster than 0.7c. The kinetic energy of this fast tail is depending on the neutron star equation of state and on the binary masses. The synchrotron flare arising from the interaction of this fast tail with the surrounding ISM can power the observed non-thermal emission that followed GW170817, provided that the ISM density 10^-2 the two neutron stars had roughly equal masses and the neutron star equation of state is soft (small neutron star radii). One of the generic predictions of this scenario is that the cooling frequency crosses the X-ray band on a time scale of a few months to a year, leading to a cooling break in the X-ray light curve. If this dynamical ejecta scenario is correct, we expect that the synchrotron radio flare from the ejecta that have produced the macronova/kilonova emission will be observable on time scales of 10^3 10^5 days

title: Continued Brightening of the Afterglow of GW170817/GRB 170817A as due to a Delayed Energy Injection
authors: Bing Li, Long-Biao Li, Yong-Feng Huang, Jin-Jun Geng, Yong-Bo Yu, Li-Ming Song
topic: The brightness of the multi-wavelength afterglow of GRB 170817A is increasing unexpectedly even approx 160 days after the associated gravitational burst. Here we suggest that the brightening can be caused by a late-time energy injection process. We use an empirical expression to mimic the evolution of the injection luminosity, which is consisted of a power-law rising phase and a power-law decreasing phase. It is found that the power-law indices of the two phases are 0.92 and −2.8, respectively, with the peak time of the injection being approx 110 days. The energy injection could be due to some kind of accretion, with the total accreted mass being \approx 0.006Msun. However, normal fall-back accretion, which usually lasts for a much shorter period, cannot provide a natural explanation. we argue that there should also be some ejecta with correspondingly lower velocities during the coalescence of the double neutron star system. They are bound by the gravitational well of the remnant central compact object and might be accreted at a timescale of about 100 days, providing a reasonable explanation for the energy injection. Detailed studies on the long-lasting brightening of GRB 170817A thus may provide useful information on the matter ejection during the merger process of binary neutron stars.

topic: (NS-NS) merger. In order to probe this association we confront our current understanding of the gravitational waves and associated electromagnetic radiation with four observed GRBs originating in binaries composed of different combinations NSs and white dwarfs (WDs). We consider 1) GRB 090510 the prototype of NS-NS merger leading to a black hole (BH); 2) GRB 130603B the prototype of a NS-NS merger leading to massive NS (MNS) with an associated kilonova; 3) GRB 060614 the prototype of a NS-WD merger leading to a MNS with an associated kilonova candidate; 4) GRB 170817A the prototype of a WD-WD merger leading to massive WD with an associated AT 2017gfo-like emission. None of these systems support the above mentioned association. The clear association between GRB 170817A and AT 2017gfo has led to introduce a new model based on on a new subfamily of GRBs originating from WD-WD mergers.

title: Effects of Fall-Back Accretion on Proto-Magnetar Outflows in Gamma-Ray Bursts and Superluminous Supernovae
authors: Brian D. Metzger, Paz Beniamini, Dimitrios Giannios
topic: Rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized proto-neutron stars ("millisecond proto-magnetars") are candidate central engines of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRB), superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), and binary neutron star mergers. The more complex evolution of the jet power and magnetization of an accreting magnetar more readily accounts for the high 56Ni yields GRB SNe and irregular time evolution of some GRB light curves (e.g.~bursts with precursors followed by a long quiescent interval before the main emission episode). Additional baryon-loading from accretion-powered neutrino irradiation of the magnetar polar cap lengthens the timeframe over which the jet magnetization is in the requisite range sigma less of equal 1e3 for efficient gamma-ray emission, thereby accommodating GRBs with ultra-long durations.

title: Is the macronova in GW170817 powered by the central engine?
authors: Tatsuya Matsumoto, Kunihito Ioka, Shota Kisaka, Ehud Nakar
topic:  Although the radioactivity of synthesized r-process elements is widely discussed as an energy source, its decisive evidence is not clearly shown yet. We discuss a macronova powered by the central engine activities such as jet activities and X-rays from the matter fallback, and show that the engine model allows much broader parameter spaces, in particular smaller ejecta mass 1e-4-0.01Msun than the r-process model. The blue and red macronovae are naturally explained by various combinations of the ejecta such as a cocoon and merger ejecta with the energy sources of jets and X-rays. The required energy injection is very similar to the X-ray excess observed in GRB 130603B with the power-law slope of \sim 1.3 The required lanthanoid fraction for the opacity can be also consistent with the Galactic one

topic: It has recently become clear that in both short and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) it coexists a sequence of different events, each characterized by specific physical processes and corresponding values of the Lorentz gamma factors. The ultra-relativistic prompt emission (UPE) phase, with Lorentz factor less Gamma=1e4 is followed by a mildly relativistic plateau-afterglow phase with Gamma=2 The GeV radiation, with Gamma approx 50  coexists with the above two phases. It is shown that: a) the GeV radiation originates at the onset of the formation of a black hole (BH), b) its luminosity follows specific power-law dependence when measured in the rest frame of the source with a decay index gamma = -1.29 \mp 0.06. We present these conceptual results for the case of short GRBs in this article and give the extended analysis for long GRBs in a companion article. A direct astrophysical application of these results is that the merger of binary neutron stars leading to BH formation emits GeV radiation: the GeV emission is a necessary and sufficient condition to indicate the creation of a BH in S-GRBs.

topic:  We find that photospheric models (both dissipative and non-dissipative variants) have difficulties accounting for the observations. Internal shocks give the most natural account of the observed peak energy, viewing angle and total energy. We also show that a simple external shock model can reproduce the observed GRB pulse with parameters consistent with those derived from the afterglow modeling. We find a simple cocoon shock breakout model is in mild tension with the observed spectral evolution, however it cannot be excluded based on gamma-ray data alone. Future joint observations of brighter GRBs will pose even tighter constraints on prompt emission models.

title: From actinides to zinc: Using the full abundance pattern of the brightest star in Reticulum II to distinguish between different r-process sites
authors: Alexander P. Ji, Anna Frebel
topic: The observed neutron-capture element abundances closely match the solar r-process component, except for the first r-process peak which is significantly lower than solar but matches other r-process enhanced stars. The ratio of first peak to heavier r-process elements implies the r-process site produces roughly equal masses of high and low electron fraction ejecta, within a factor of 2. We compare the detailed abundance pattern to predictions from nucleosynthesis calculations of neutron star mergers and magneto-rotationally driven jet supernovae, finding that nuclear physics uncertainties dominate over astrophysical uncertainties. The abundance of light elements up to Zn are consistent with extremely metal-poor Milky Way halo stars. They may eventually provide a way to distinguish between neutron star mergers and magneto-rotationally driven jet supernovae, but this would require more detailed knowledge of the chemical evolution of Reticulum II.

topic: We present \beta-delayed neutron emission and \beta-delayed fission calculations for heavy, neutron-rich nuclei using the coupled Quasi-Particle Random Phase Approximation plus Hauser-Feshbach (QRPA+HF) approach. From the initial population of a compound nucleus after \beta-decay, we follow the statistical decay taking into account competition between neutrons, \gamma-rays, and fission. We find a region of the chart of nuclides where the probability of \beta-delayed fission is \approx 100%, that likely prevents the production of superheavy elements in nature. We explore the impact of \beta-delayed fission in rapid neutron capture process (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the tidal ejecta of a neutron star--neutron star merger and show that it is a key fission channel that shapes the final abundances near the second r-process peak.

title: Convective Excitation of Inertial Modes in Binary Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Roberto De Pietri, Alessandra Feo, José A. Font, Frank Löffler, Francesco Maione, Michele Pasquali, Nikolaos Stergioulas
topic: We present the first very long-term simulations (extending up to ~140 ms after merger) of binary neutron star mergers with piecewise polytropic equations of state and in full general relativity. Our simulations reveal that at a time of 30-50 ms after merger, parts of the star become convectively unstable, which triggers the excitation of inertial modes. The excited inertial modes are sustained up to several tens of milliseconds and are potentially observable by the planned third-generation gravitational-wave detectors at frequencies of a few kilohertz. Since inertial modes depend on the rotation rate of the star and they are triggered by a convective instability in the postmerger remnant, their detection in gravitational waves will provide a unique opportunity to probe the rotational and thermal state of the merger remnant. In addition, our findings have implications for the long-term evolution and stability of binary neutron star remnants

title: The MRI imprint on the Short-GRB Jets
authors: K. Sapountzis, A. Janiuk
topic: Short gamma ray bursts are presumably results of binary neutron star mergers, which lead to the formation of a stellar mass black hole, surrounded by a remnant matter. The strong magnetic fields help collimate jets of plasma, launched along the axis of the black hole rotation. We study the structure and evolution of the accreting plasma in the short GRBs and we model the formation of the base of a relativistic, Poynting-dominated jets. Our numerical models are based on the general relativistic MHD, axisymmetric simulations. We discuss the origin of variability in the GRB jet emission, which timescales are related to the action of the magneto-rotational instability in the accreting plasma. We also estimate the value of a maximum achievable Lorentz factor in the jets produced by our simulations, and reached at the large distances, where the gamma ray emission is produced.

authors: Iair Arcavi
topic: The combined optical data show an early rise consistent with radioactive decay of low opacity ejecta as the main emission source, but the subsequent decline is fit well by all models. A lack of constraints on the ultraviolet flux during the first few hours after discovery allows for both radioactive decay and other cooling mechanisms to explain the early bolometric light curve. This analysis demonstrates that early (few hours after merger) high-cadence optical and ultraviolet observations will be critical for determining the source of blue emission in future kilonovae.

title: Inverse compton scattered merger-nova: late X-ray counterpart of gravitational wave signals from NS-NS/BH mergers
authors: Shunke Ai, He Gao
topic:  The central remnant could launch a collimated jet and when the jet propagating through the ejecta, a mildly relativistic cocoon would be formed and the interaction between the cocoon and the ambient medium would accelerate electrons via external shock in a wide angle. So that the merger-nova photons (i.e., thermal emission from the ejecta) would be scattered into higher frequency via inverse compton (IC) process when they propagating through the cocoon shocked region. We find that the IC scattered component peaks at X-ray band and it will reach its peak luminosity in order of days (simultaneously with the merger-nova emission). With current X-ray detectors, such a late X-ray component could be detected out to 200 Mpc, depending on the merger remnant properties. It could serve as an important electromagnetic counterpart of gravitational wave signals from NS-NS/BH mergers.

topic: Considering the relatively large total mass, it is generally proposed that the merger of GW170817 would lead to a shortly lived hypermassive NS or directly produce a black hole (BH). There is no clear evidence to support or rule out a long-lived NS as the merger remnant. Here we utilize the GW and electromagnetic (EM) signals to comprehensively investigate the parameter space that allows a long-lived NS to survive as the merger remnant of GW170817. We find that for some stiff equations of state, the merger of GW170817 could, in principle, lead to a massive NS, which has a millisecond spin period. The post-merger GW signal could hardly constrain the ellipticity of the NS

title: Compton echoes from nearby Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Paz Beniamini, Dimitrios Giannios, George Younes, Alexander J. van der Horst, Chryssa Kouveliotou
topic: We consider here Compton echoes, the scattered light from the prompt and afterglow emission. Compton echoes, an as yet undetected counterpart of GRBs, peak in X-rays and maintain a roughly constant flux for hundreds to thousands of years after the burst. Though too faint to be detected in typical cosmological GRBs, a fraction of close by bursts with a sufficiently large energy output in X-rays, and for which the surrounding medium is sufficiently dense, may indeed be observed in this way. The detection of a Compton echo could provide unique insight into the burst properties and the environment's density structure. In particular, it could potentially determine whether or not there was a successful jet that broke through the compact binary merger ejecta. We discuss here the properties and expectations from Compton echoes and suggest methods for detectability.

title: Compact binary merger and kilonova: outflows from remnant disc
authors: Tuan Yi, Wei-Min Gu, Tong Liu, Rajiv Kumar, Hui-Jun Mu, Cui-Ying Song
topic: Outflows launched from a remnant disc of compact binary merger may have essential contribution to the kilonova emission. Numerical calculations are conducted in this work to study the structure of accretion flows and outflows. By the incorporation of limited-energy advection in the hyper-accretion discs, outflows occur naturally from accretion flows due to imbalance between the viscous heating and the sum of the advective and radiative cooling. Following this spirit, we revisit the properties of the merger outflow ejecta. Our results show that around of the disc mass can be launched as powerful outflows. The amount of unbound mass varies with the disc mass and the viscosity. The outflow-contributed peak luminosity is around.

title: Implications of the radio and X-ray emission that followed GW170817
authors: Ehud Nakar, Tsvi Piran
topic: The radio and X-rays that followed GW170817 increased gradually over similar  100 days, resembling the radio flare predicted to arise from the interaction of a binary neutron star merger outflow with the ISM \citep{nakar2011}. Considering a blast wave moving with a Lorentz factor Gamma, we show that an off-axis observer, namely an observer at. Observations imply that at all times we have seen an on-axis emission. The isotropic equivalent energy in the observed region increases with time,  implying that the outflow was structured. The energy increase can arise from a slower material moving behind the blast wave or from a matter moving at larger angles that has slowed down. Such a structure could have different origins, however, the only physically motivated one, proposed so far, is the interaction of a relativistic jet with the ejecta and the resulting cocoon. The jet could have been choked or successful. In the latter case, it has produced a short GRB pointing elsewhere (this successful jet-cocoon system is sometimes called a "structured jet")

This robust main r-process pattern is a necessary constraint for r-process formation scenarios (of particular interest in light of the recent neutron star merger, GW 170817), and has important consequences for the origins of r-II stars. Additional r-I and r-II stars will be reported by the R-Process Alliance in the near future.

title: Uncertainties in radiative neutron-capture rates relevant to the A similar 80 r-process peak
authors: I. K. B. Kullmann, E. W. Hafli, A.C. Larsen, E. Lima
topic: The rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) has for the first time been confirmed to take place in a neutron-star merger event. A detailed understanding of the rapid neutron-capture process is one of the holy grails in nuclear astrophysics. In this work we investigate one aspect of the r-process modelling: uncertainties in radiative neutron-capture cross sections and astrophysical reaction rates for isotopes of the elements Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, and Se. In particular, we study deviations from standard libraries used for astrophysics, and the influence of a very-low γ-energy enhancement in the average, reduced γ-decay probability on the (n,γ) rates. We find that the intrinsic uncertainties are in some cases extremely large, and that the low-energy enhancement, if present in neutron-rich nuclei, may increase the neutron-capture reaction rate significantly.

authors: E. Troja, L. Piro, G. Ryan, H. van Eerten, R. Ricci, M. H. Wieringa, S. Lotti, T. Sakamoto, S. B. Cenko
topic: We present our broadband study of GW170817 from radio to hard X-rays, including NuSTAR and Chandra observations up to 165 days after the merger, and a multi-messenger analysis including LIGO constraints. The data are compared with predictions from a wide range of models, providing the first detailed comparison between non-trivial cocoon and jet models. Homogeneous and power-law shaped jets, as well as simple cocoon models are ruled out by the data, while both a Gaussian shaped jet and a cocoon with energy injection can describe the current dataset for a reasonable range of physical parameters, consistent with the typical values derived from short GRB afterglows. We propose that these models can be unambiguously discriminated by future observations measuring the post-peak behaviour, with slope -1.0 for the cocoon and -2.5 for the jet model.

topic: We report our observation of the short GRB 170817A, associated to the binary neutron star merger event GW 170817, perfomed in the X-ray band with XMM-Newton 135 d after the event (on the 29th December 2017). We find evidence for a flattening of the X-ray light curve with respect to the previously observed brightening. We interpret all the existing afterglow data with two models: i) a structured jet and ii) a jet-less isotropic fireball with some stratification in its radial velocity structure. Both models fit the data and predict that the radio flux must decrease simultaneously with the optical and the X-ray one, making hard to distinguish between them at the present stage. Polarimetric measures and the rate of short GRB-GW association in future LIGO/Virgo runs will be key to disentangle these two geometrically different scenarios.

title: Prompt gamma-ray emission of GRB 170817A associated to GW 170817: A consistent picture
authors: Houri Ziaeepour
topic: Here we use a phenomenological model of shock evolution and synchrotron/self-Compton emission to simulate the prompt emission of GRB 170817A and to test above proposals. We find that synchrotron emission from a mildly relativistic cocoon with a Lorentz factor of 2-3, as considered in the literature, generates a too soft, too long, and too bright prompt emission. Off-axis view of an structured jet with a Lorentz factor of about 10 can reproduce observations, but needs a very efficient transfer of kinetic energy to electrons in internal shocks, which is disfavored by particle in cell simulations. We also comment on cocoon breakout as a mechanism for generation of the prompt gamma-ray. A relativistic jet with a Lorentz factor of about 100 and a density lower than typical short GRBs seems to be the most plausible model and we conclude that GRB 170817A was intrinsically faint. Based on this result and findings of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of BNS merger in the literature we discuss physical and astronomical conditions, which may lead to such faint short GRBs

title: An explosion is triggered by the late collapse of the compact remnant from a neutron star merger
authors: Antonios Nathanail
topic: The collapse of this compact remnant to a black- hole-torus system is expected to give rise to a powerful jet and a short gamma-ray burst. Nevertheless, if the collapse is delayed half a second or so, the surrounding matter would be already accreted and/or expelled and hence no torus will be formed. However, the collapse itself will give rise to a quasi-isotropic magnetized fireball. This magnetic bomb will dissipate much of its energy due to magnetic re-connection and will produce the prompt emission, when the fireball will become transparent to gamma-rays. The energy range of such an explosion depends on the initial magnetic field strength of the two neutron stars and the amplification of the magnetic energy during merger. We discuss the production of a quasi-isotropic magnetized fireball and its subsequent interaction with the ejected matter during merger, as the outcome of the coalescence of a binary neutron star system.

In the next years, the searches for VHE EM counterparts will become more effective thanks to the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) We present a comprehensive study on the prospects for joint GW and VHE EM observations of merging BNSs with Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and CTA, based on detailed simulations of the multi-messenger emission and detection.

title: A magnetar origin for the kilonova ejecta in GW170817
authors: Brian D. Metzger, Todd A. Thompson, Eliot Quataert
topic: We propose an alternative ejecta source: the neutrino-heated, magnetically-accelerated wind from the strongly-magnetized hypermassive NS (HMNS) remnant. A rapidly-spinning HMNS with an ordered surface magnetic field of strength B ~ 1-3e14 G and lifetime t_rem ~ 0.1-1 s can simultaneously explain the velocity, total mass, and electron fraction of the blue KN ejecta. The inferred HMNS lifetime is close to its Alfven crossing time, suggesting global magnetic torques could be responsible for bringing the HMNS into solid body rotation and instigating its gravitational collapse. Different origins for the KN ejecta may be distinguished by their predictions for the emission in the first hours after the merger, when the luminosity is enhanced by heating from internal shocks; the latter are likely generic to any temporally-extended ejecta source (e.g. magnetar or accretion disk wind) and are not unique to the emergence of a relativistic jet.

authors: Raffaella Margutti, K.D. Alexander, X. Xie, L. Sironi, B.D. Metzger, A. Kathirgamaraju, W. Fong, P.K. Blanchard, E. Berger, A. MacFadyen, et al
topic: We report deep Chandra, HST and VLA observations of the binary neutron star event GW170817 at t less 160 d after merger. These observations show that GW170817 has been steadily brightening with time and might have now reached its peak, and constrain the emission process as non-thermal synchrotron emission where the cooling frequency νc is above the X-ray band and the synchrotron frequency nu_m is below the radio band. The very simple power-law spectrum extending for eight orders of magnitude in frequency enables the most precise measurement of the index p of the distribution of non-thermal relativistic electrons N(gamma)\prop to gamma−p accelerated by a shock launched by a NS-NS merger to date.  We find p=2.17 \pm 0.01, which indicates that radiation from ejecta with Gamma similar 3−10 dominates the observed emission. While constraining the nature of the emission process, these observations do \emph{not} constrain the nature of the relativistic ejecta. We employ simulations of explosive outflows launched in NS ejecta clouds to show that the spectral and temporal evolution of the non-thermal emission from GW170817 is consistent with both emission from radially stratified quasi-spherical ejecta traveling at mildly relativistic speeds, \emph{and} emission from off-axis collimated ejecta characterized by a narrow cone of ultra-relativistic material with slower wings extending to larger angles. In the latter scenario, GW170817 harbored a normal SGRB directed away from our line of sight.

topic: Surface abundance observations of halo stars hint at the occurrence of r-process nucleosynthesis at low metallicity... Possible loci of early-Universe r-process nucleosynthesis are the ejecta of either black hole--neutron star or neutron star--neutron star binary mergers. Here we study the effect of the inclination--eccentricity oscillations raised by a tertiary (e.g. a star) on the coalescence time scale of the inner compact object binaries. Our results are highly sensitive to the assumed initial distribution of the inner binary semi-major axes. Our results provide additional support to the compact object merger scenario for r-process nucleosynthesis.

topic: The electromagnetic signal began approximately 2 seconds post-merger with a weak, short burst of gamma-rays, which was followed over the next hours and days by the ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared emission from a radioactively- powered kilonova. Later, non-thermal rising X-ray and radio emission was observed. The low luminosity of the gamma-rays and the rising non-thermal flux from the source at late times could indicate that we are outside the opening angle of the beamed relativistic jet. Alternatively, the emission could be arising from a cocoon of material formed from the interaction between a jet and the merger ejecta. Here we present late-time optical detections and deep near-infrared limits on the emission from GW170817 at 110 days post-merger. Our new observations are at odds with expectations of late-time emission from kilonova models, being too bright and blue. Instead, the emission arises from the interaction between the relativistic ejecta of GW170817 and the interstellar medium. We show that this emission matches the expectations of a Gaussian structured relativistic jet, which would have launched a high luminosity short GRB to an aligned observer. However, other jet structure or cocoon models can also match current data - the future evolution of the afterglow will directly distinguish the origin of the emission.

title: Optimized Radio Follow Up of Binary Neutron-Star Mergers
authors: Dario Carbone, Alessandra Corsi
topic: We simulate GW170817-like radio transients, and radio afterglows generated by fast jets with isotropic energy expanding in a low-density interstellar medium bserved from different viewing angles (from slightly off-axis to largely off-axis). We then determine the optimal timing of GHz radio observations following the precise localization of the BNS radio counterpart candidate, assuming a sensitivity comparable to that of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The optimization is done so as to ensure that properties such as viewing angle and circumstellar density can be correctly reconstructed with the minimum number of observations. We show that radio is the optimal band to explore the fastest ejecta from BNSs in low-density ISM, since the optical emission is likelyto be dominated by the so-called `kilonova' component, while X-rays from the jet are detectable only for a small subset of the BNS models considered here.

title: The Origin of the Prompt Emission for Short GRB 170817A: Photosphere Emission or Synchrotron Emission?
authors: Yan-Zhi Meng, Jin-Jun Geng, Bin-Bin Zhang, Jun-Jie Wei et al
topic: The origin of this short GRB is still under debate, but a plausible interpretation is that it is due to the off-axis emission from a structured jet. We consider two possibilities. First, since the best-fit spectral model for the main pulse of GRB 170817A is a cutoff power law with a hard low-energy photon index (α=−0.62+0.49−0.54), we consider an off-axis photosphere model. We develop a theory of photosphere emission in a structured jet and find that such a model can reproduce a low-energy photon index that is softer than a blackbody through enhancing high-latitude emission. The model can naturally account for the observed spectrum. The best-fit Lorentz factor along the line of sight is \sim 20, which demands that there is a significant delay between the merger and jet launching. Alternatively, we consider that the emission is produced via synchrotron radiation in an optically thin region in an expanding jet with decreasing magnetic fields.

title: Neutron Star Mergers as sites of r-process Nucleosynthesis and Short Gamma-Ray Bursts
authors: Kenta Hotokezaka, Paz Beniamini, Tsvi Piran
topic: We overview observational evidence supporting this scenario including: the total amount of r-process elements in the Galaxy, extreme metal poor stars, geological radioactive elemental abundances, dwarf galaxies, and short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). The ultra-violet, optical, and near infrared observations point to r-process elements that have been synthesized in the merger ejecta. The rate and ejected mass inferred from GW170817 and the EM counterparts are consistent with other observations. We find however that, within simple one zone chemical evolution models (based on merger rates with reasonable delay time distributions as expected from evolutionary models, or from observations of sGRBs), it is difficult to reconcile the current observations of the europium abundance history of Galactic stars for [Fe/H] more then −1. This implies that to account for the role of mergers in the Galactic chemical evolution, we need a Galactic model with multiple populations that have different spatial distributions and/or varying formation rates.

title: Cannonball model diagnosis of the short gamma ray burst 170817A
authors: Shlomo Dado, Arnon Dar, Alvaro De Rujula
topic: The rich and complex data obtained from multi-wavelength observations of SHB170817A, the short hard gamma ray burst (SHB) associated with GW170817 --the first neutron stars merger event detected in gravitational waves (GWs)-- are analyzed in the framework of the cannonball model of SHBs. In this model a highly relativistic jet is launched by fall back matter on the nascent neutron star (or black hole) into a surrounding glory (light from the surrounding wind nebula of the binary neutron stars) which was present already before the merger. The SHB was produced by inverse Compton scattering of glory photons by the jet, which was viewed far off-axis. The fading glory, which produced the initial UVOIR afterglow, was powered by a neutron star remnant. It was overtaken by a late time X-ray, UVOIR and radio afterglow produced by synchrotron radiation from the decelerating jet in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy. If the radio afterglow of SHB170817A was indeed produced by the jet, it should display a superluminal motion relative to the SHB location, still detectable in VLA and VLBI radio observations.

authors: Xiang-Yu Wang, Zhi-Qiu Huang
topic: It has been suggested that this mildly relativistic outflow may represent a cocoon of material. We suggest that the velocity gradient profile may form during the stage that the cocoon is breaking out of the merger ejecta, resulted from shock propagation down a density gradient. The cooling of the hot relativistic cocoon material immediately after it breaks out should have produced soft X-ray to UV radiation at tens of seconds to hours after the merger. The soft X-ray emission has a luminosity of 10^45 over a period of tens of seconds for a merger event like GW 170817. The UV emission shows a rise initially and peaks at about a few hours with a luminosity of 10^42

authors: Davide Lazzati, Rosalba Perna, Brian J. Morsony, Diego López-Cámara, Matteo Cantiello, Riccardo Ciolfi, Bruno giacomazzo, Jared C. Workman
topic: Here we show that structured jets with a relativistic, energetic core surrounded by slower and less energetic wings produce afterglow emission that brightens characteristically with time, as recently seen in the afterglow of GW170817. Initially, we only see the relatively slow material moving towards us. As time passes, larger and larger sections of the outflow become visible, increasing the luminosity of the afterglow. The late appearance and increasing brightness of the multi-wavelength afterglow of GW170817 allow us to constrain the geometry of its ejecta and thus reveal the presence of an off-axis jet pointing about 30 degrees away from Earth. Our results confirm a single origin for BNS mergers and short GRBs: GW170817 produced a structured outflow with a highly relativistic core and a canonical short GRB.

title: A more stringent constraint on the mass ratio of binary neutron star merger GW170817
authors: He Gao, Zhoujian Cao, Shunke Ai, Bing Zhang
topic: Here we propose that if one can constrain the dynamical ejecta mass through performing kilonova modeling of the optical/IR data, by utilizing an empirical relation between the dynamical ejecta mass and the mass ratio of NS binaries, one may place a more stringent constraint on the mass ratio of the system. For instance, considering that the red "kilonova" component is powered by the dynamical ejecta, we reach a tight constraint on the mass ratio in the range of 0.46-0.59. Alternatively, if the blue "kilonova" component is powered by the dynamical ejecta, the mass ratio would be constrained in the range of 0.53-0.67. Overall, such a multi-messenger approach could narrow down the mass ratio of GW170817 system to the range of 0.46-0.67, which gives a more precise estimation of the individual NS mass than pure GW signal analysis

topic: The counter jet of a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) has not yet been observed, while recent discoveries of gravitational waves (GWs) from a binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 and the associated sGRB 170817A have demonstrated that off-axis sGRB jets are detectable. We calculate the prompt emission from the counter jet of an sGRB and show that it is typically 23-26 mag in the optical-infrared band 10-10^3 sec after the GWs for an sGRB 170817A-like event, which is brighter than the early macronova (or kilonova) emission and detectable by LSST in the near future. We also propose a new method to constrain the unknown jet properties, such as the Lorentz factor, opening angle, emission radii, and jet launch time, by observing both the forward and counter jets. To scrutinize the counter jets, space GW detectors like DECIGO are powerful in forecasting the merger time (less or equal 1 sec) and position (less or equal 1 arcmin) (similar a week) before the merger.

authors: H. Tong, C. Yu, L. Huang
topic: The gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A associated with GW170817 is subluminous and subenergetic compared with other typical short GRBs. It may be due to a relativistic jet viewed off-axis, or a structured jet, or cocoon emission. Giant flares from magnetars may possibly be ruled out. However, the luminosity and energetics of GRB 170817A is coincident with that of magnetar giant flares. After the coalescence of the binary neutron star, a hypermassive neutron star may be formed. The hypermassive neutron star may have magnetar-strength magnetic field. During the collapse of the hypermassive neutron star, the magnetic field energy will also be released. This giant-flare-like event may explain the the luminosity and energetics of GRB 170817A. Bursts with similar luminosity and energetics are expected in future neutron star-neutron star or neutron star-black hole mergers.

topic: We perform long-term general relativistic neutrino radiation hydrodynamics simulations (in axisymmetry) for a massive neutron star (MNS) surrounded by a torus, which is a canonical remnant formed after the binary neutron star merger. We take into account the effects of viscosity, which is likely to arise in the merger remnant due to magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. We study the ejecta & remnant structure.

title: A long-lived remnant neutron star after GW170817 inferred from its associated kilonova
authors: Yun-Wei Yu, Liang-Duan Liu, Zi-Gao Dai
topic: However, whether a long-lived remnant NS could be formed during this merger event remains unknown, although such a central engine has been suggested by afterglow observations of some short-duration GRBs. By invoking this long-lived remnant NS, we here propose a model of hybrid energy sources for the kilonova AT2017gfo associated with GW 170817. While the early emission of AT2017gfo is still powered radioactively as usually suggested, its late emission is primarily caused by delayed energy injection from the remnant NS. S. These self-consistent results indicate that a long-lived remnant NS, which must own a very stiff equation of state, had been formed during the merger event of GW170817. This provides a very stringent constraint on the strong interaction in nuclear-quark matter. It is further implied that such GW events could provide a probe of the early spin and magnetic evolutions of NSs, e.g., the burying of surface magnetic fields.

authors: N. Fraija, F. De Colle, P. Veres, S. Dichiara, R. Barniol Duran, A. Galvan-Gamez, and A.C. Caligula do E. S. Pedreira
topic: In this paper, we show that the X-ray, optical and radio fluxes are consistent with the synchrotron forward-shock model viewed off-axis when the matter in the outflow is parametrized through a power law velocity distribution. We discuss the origin of the γ-ray peak in terms of internal and external shocks. We show that the γ-ray flux might be consistent with a synchrotron self-Compton reverse-shock model observed at high latitudes. Comparing the best-fit values obtained after describing the γ-ray, X-ray, optical and radio fluxes with our model, we find that the afterglow and γ-ray emission occurred in different regions and also evidence to propose that the progenitor environment was entrained with magnetic fields and therefore, we argue for the presence of the magnetic field amplification in the binary neutron star merger.

authors: Ian M. Shoemaker, Kohta Murase
topic: Using GW170817 as the first GW-EM example, we show that this event provides a stringent direct test that GWs travel at the speed of light. The gravitational potential of the Milky Way provides a potential source of Shapiro time delay difference between the arrival of photons and GWs, and we demonstrate that the nearly coincident detection of the GW and EM signals can yield strong limits on anomalous gravitational time delay, through updating the previous limits taking into account details of Milky Way's gravitational potential. Finally, we also obtain an intriguing limit on the size of the prompt emission region of GRB 170817A, and discuss implications for the emission mechanism of short gamma-ray bursts.

topic: Short duration Gamma Ray Bursts(SGRB) and their afterglows are among the most promising electro-magnetic (EM) counterparts of Neutron Star (NS) mergers. The afterglow emission is broadband, visible across the entire electro-magnetic window from γ-ray to radio frequencies. The flux evolution in these frequencies is sensitive to the multi-dimensional afterglow physical parameter space. Observations of gravitational wave (GW) from BNS mergers in spatial and temporal coincidence with SGRB and associated afterglows can provide valuable constraints on afterglow physics. We run simulations of GW-detected BNS events and assuming all of them are associated with a GRB jet which also produces an afterglow,

authors: Kunihito Ioka, Takashi Nakamura
topic: Gravitational waves from a merger of two neutron stars (NSs) were discovered for the first time in GW170817, together with diverse electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. To make constraints on a relativistic jet from the NS merger, we calculate the EM signals in (1) the short gamma-ray burst sGRB 170817A from an off-axis jet, (2) the optical-infrared macronova (or kilonova), especially the blue macronova, from a jet-powered cocoon, and (3) the X-ray and radio afterglows from the interaction between the jet and interstellar medium. We find that a typical sGRB jet is consistent with these observations, and there is a parameter space to explain all the observations in a unified fashion

We then show that the observations are consistent with the predictions of a mildly relativistic shock breakout: a minute γ-ray energy as compared with the total energy and a rather smooth light curve with a hard to soft evolution. We present here a novel analytic study and detailed numerical 2D and 3D relativistic hydrodynamic and radiation simulations that support the picture in which the observed γ-rays arose from a shock breakout of a cocoon from the merger's ejecta

authors: Benoit Côté, Chris L. Fryer, Krzysztof Belczynski, Oleg Korobkin, Martyna Chruślińska, Nicole Vassh, Matthew R. Mumpower, Jonas Lippuner, Trevor M. Sprouse, Rebecca Surman, Ryan Wollaeger
topic: However, it is still unclear which astrophysical site between core-collapse supernovae and neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS) mergers produced most of the r-process elements in the universe. Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models can test these scenarios by quantifying the frequency and yields required to reproduce the amount of europium (Eu) observed in galaxies. Although NS-NS mergers have become popular candidates, their required frequency (or rate) needs to be consistent with that obtained from gravitational wave measurements. Here we address the first NS-NS merger detected by LIGO/Virgo (GW170817) and its associated Gamma-ray burst and analyze their implication on the origin of r-process elements. This is the first study that directly combines nuclear physics uncertainties with GCE calculations. If GW170817 is a representative event, NS-NS mergers can produce Eu in sufficient amounts and are likely to be the main r-process site.

title: GRB 170817A as a jet counterpart to gravitational wave trigger GW 170817
authors: Gavin P Lamb, Shiho Kobayashi
topic: In this paper, we assume that the γ-ray emission is caused by energy dissipation within a relativistic jet and we model the afterglow synchrotron emission from a reverse- and forward-shock in the outflow. We show the afterglow for a low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet with a high Lorentz-factor (Gamma); a low-Gamma and low-kinetic energy jet; a low-Gamma, high kinetic energy jet; structured jets viewed at an inclination within the jet-half-opening angle; and an off-axis `typical' GRB jet. All jet models will produce observable afterglows on various timescales. The late-time afterglow from 10-110 days can be fit by a Gaussian structured jet viewed at a moderate inclination, however, the GRB is not directly reproduced by this model.

title: Estimating the Contribution of Dynamical Ejecta in the Kilonova Associated with GW170817
authors: LIGO Scientific Collaboration, Virgo Collaboration
topic: The source of the gravitational-wave signal GW170817, very likely a binary neutron star merger, was also observed electromagnetically, providing the first multi-messenger observations of this type. The two week long electromagnetic counterpart had a signature indicative of an r-process-induced optical transient known as a kilonova. This Letter examines how the mass of the dynamical ejecta can be estimated without a direct electromagnetic observation of the kilonova, using gravitational-wave measurements and a phenomenological model calibrated to numerical simulations of mergers with dynamical ejecta. Specifically, we apply the model to the binary masses inferred from the gravitational-wave measurements, and use the resulting mass of the dynamical ejecta to estimate its contribution (without the effects of wind ejecta) to the corresponding kilonova light curves from various models. The distributions of dynamical ejecta mass range between 10^3 10^2 for various equations of state, assuming the neutron stars are rotating slowly. In addition, we use our estimates of the dynamical ejecta mass and the neutron star merger rates inferred from GW170817 to constrain the contribution of events like this to the r-process element abundance in the Galaxy when ejecta mass from post-merger winds is neglected. We find that if \geq 10% of the matter dynamically ejected from BNS mergers is converted to r-process elements, GW170817-like BNS mergers could fully account for the amount of r-process material observed in the Milky Way.

title: Evidence for Cocoon Emission from the Early Light Curve of SSS17a
authors: Anthony L. Piro, Juna A. Kollmeier
topic: Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) was discovered as the first optical counterpart to the gravitational wave event GW170817. Although its light curve on the timescale of weeks roughly matches the expected luminosity and red color of an r-process powered transient, the explanation for the blue emission from high velocity material over the first few days is not as clear. Here we show that the power-law evolution of the luminosity, temperature, and photospheric radius during these early times can be explained by cooling of shock heated material around the neutron star merger. This heating is likely from the interaction of the gamma-ray burst jet with merger debris, so-called cocoon emission. We summarize the properties of this emission and provide formulae that can be used to study future detections of shock cooling from merging neutron stars. This argues that optical transient surveys should search for such early, blue light if they wish to find off-axis gamma-ray bursts and double neutron star gravitational wave events as soon as possible after the merger.

title: Binary neutron star merger rate via the luminosity function of short gamma-ray bursts
authors: Debdutta Paul
topic: The luminosity function of short Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) is modelled by using the available catalogue data of all short GRBs (sGRBs) detected till October, 2017. The luminosities are estimated via the "pseudo-redshifts" obtained from the "Yonetoku correlation", assuming a standard delay distribution between the cosmic star formation rate and the production rate of their progenitors. While the simple powerlaw is ruled out to high confidence, the data is fit well both by exponential cutoff powerlaw and broken powerlaw models. Using the derived parameters of these models along with conservative values in the jet opening angles seen from afterglow observations, the true rate of short GRBs are derived.

topic: We present our observations of electromagnetic transients associated with GW170817/GRB 170817A using optical telescopes of Chilescope observatory and Big Scanning Antenna (BSA) of Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory at 110MHz. The Chilescope observatory detected an optical transient of \sim 19m on the third day in the outskirts of the galaxy NGC 4993; we continued observations following its rapid decrease. We put an upper limit of 1.5×104 Jy on any radio source with a duration of 10-60 s which may be associated with GW170817/GRB 170817A. The prompt gamma-ray emission consists of two distinctive components - a hard short pulse delayed by \sim 2 seconds with respect to the LIGO signal and softer thermal pulse with T\sim 10 keV lasting for another \sim 2 seconds. The appearance of a thermal component at the end of the burst is unusual for short GRBs. Both the hard and the soft components do not satisfy the Amati relation, making GRB 170817A distinctively different from other short GRBs. Based on gamma-ray and optical observations, we develop a model for the prompt high-energy emission associated with GRB 170817A. The merger of two neutron stars creates an accretion torus of \sim 10−2Msun, which supplies the black hole with magnetic flux and confines the Blandford-Znajek-powered jet. We associate the hard prompt spike with the quasispherical breakout of the jet from the disk wind. As the jet plows through the wind with subrelativistic velocity, it creates a radiation-dominated shock that heats the wind material to tens of kiloelectron volts, producing the soft thermal component.

authors: S. Rosswog, J. Sollerman, U. Feindt, A. Goobar, O. Korobkin, C. Fremling, M. Kasliwal
topic: Here we discuss the role of neutron star mergers (NSMs) in the light of the first direct detection of such an event in both gravitational (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) waves. We analyse bolometric and NIR lightcurves of the first detected double neutron star merger and compare them to nuclear reaction network-based macronova models. The slope of the bolometric lightcurve is consistent with the radioactive decay of neutron star ejecta with Ye≲0.3 (but not larger), which provides strong evidence for an r-process origin of the electromagnetic emission. This rules out in particular "nickel winds" as major source of the emission. We find that the NIR lightcurves can be well fitted either with or without lanthanide-rich ejecta.

topic: Here we compare the optical and near-infrared light curves of this KN, AT2017gfo, to the counterparts of a sample of nearby (z less 0.5) SGRBs to characterize their diversity in terms of their brightness distribution. Although at similar epochs AT2017gfo appears fainter than every SGRB-associated KN claimed so far, we find three bursts (GRBs 050509B, 061201 and 080905A) where, if the reported redshifts are correct, deep upper limits rule out the presence of a KN similar to AT2017gfo by several magnitudes. Combined with the properties of previously claimed KNe in SGRBs this suggests considerable diversity in the properties of KN drawn from compact object mergers, despite the similar physical conditions that are expected in many NS-NS mergers

title: Repeating and Non-repeating Fast Radio Bursts from Binary Neutron Star Mergers
authors: Shotaro Yamasaki, Tomonori Totani, Kenta Kiuchi
topic: However, the merger environment is polluted by dynamical ejecta, which may prohibit the radio signal to propagate. We examine this by using a general-relativistic simulation of a BNS merger, and show that the ejecta appears about 1 ms after the rotation speed of the merged star becomes the maximum. Therefore there is a time window in which an FRB signal can reach outside, and the short duration of non-repeating FRBs can be explained by screening after ejecta formation. A fraction of BNS mergers may leave a rapidly rotating and stable neutron star, and such objects may be the origin of repeating FRBs like FRB 121102.

Second, we find that the magnetorotational instability in the RMNS envelope and torus with ρ less 10^13 g cm−3 sustains magneto-turbulent state and the effective viscous parameter in these regions is likely to converge to approx 0.01--0.02 with respect to the grid resolution.

Our motivation is to explore the radio signatures of the forward and reverse shock in a sGRB jet, as well as the off-axis jet component and radio emission from the dynamical ejecta. We estimate the fraction of GRBs detectable in the radio that may be coincident with a GW signal from a neutron star (NS) merger. At the distance to which aLIGO at design specification is sensitive to GWs from NS mergers, we may detect up to 20 % of off-axis jet radio components of these events, and up to about 10 % of events with radio emission from the tidal ejecta shocking with the external medium. We discuss our results in light of the Next Generation Very Large Array, expected to make significant progress in detecting radio signals from sGRBs.

We find overwhelming evidence for a bimodal distribution, in agreement with previous literature, and report for the first time positive evidence for a sharp cut-off at a maximum neutron star mass. We obtain a lower bound on the maximum sound speed attained inside the neutron star. Our constraints on the maximum neutron star mass strengthen the case for neutron star-neutron star mergers as the primary source of short gamma-ray bursts.

title: Monte-Carlo closure for moment-based transport schemes in general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics simulations
authors: Francois Foucart
topic:  Photon transport plays a crucial role in radiatively dominated accretion disks, while neutrino transport is critical to core-collapse supernovae and to the modeling of electromagnetic transients and nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers. However, evolving the full Boltzmann equations of radiative transport is extremely expensive. Here, we describe the implementation in the general relativistic SpEC code of a cheaper radiation hydrodynamics method which theoretically converges to a solution of Boltzmann's equation in the limit of infinite numerical resources. The algorithm is based on a gray two-moment scheme, in which we evolve the energy density and momentum density of the radiation. Two-moment schemes require a closure which fills in missing information about the energy spectrum and higher-order moments of the radiation. Instead of the approximate analytical closure currently used in core-collapse and merger simulations, we complement the two-moment scheme with a low-accuracy Monte-Carlo evolution. The Monte-Carlo results can provide any or all of the missing information in the evolution of the moments, as desired by the user.

title: Closed-form tidal approximants for binary neutron star gravitational waveforms constructed from high-resolution numerical relativity simulations
authors: Tim Dietrich, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Wolfgang Tichy
topic: We construct closed-form gravitational waveforms (GWs) with tidal effects for the coalescence and merger of binary neutron stars. The method relies on a new set of eccentricity-reduced and high-resolution numerical relativity (NR) simulations and is composed of three steps. First, tidal contributions to the GW phase are extracted from the time-domain NR data. Second, those contributions are employed to fix high-order coefficients in an effective and resummed post-Newtonian expression. Third, frequency-domain tidal approximants are built using the stationary phase approximation. Our tidal approximants are valid from the low frequencies to the strong-field regime and up to merger. They can be analytically added to any binary black hole GW model to obtain a binary neutron star waveform, either in the time or in the frequency domain. This work provides simple, flexible, and accurate models ready to be used in both searches and parameter estimation of binary neutron star events.

We focus on models with stars of mass 1.4 M_sol each, which employ the equation of state (EOS) by Shen, Horowitz, and Teige, and which result in stable NSs as merger remnants. We present visualizations of the fluid flow and temperature distribution and find a strong impact of the spin on vortex structure and nonaxisymmetric deformation. We compute the radial mass distribution and the rotation profile in the equatorial plane using recently developed measures independent of spatial gauge, revealing slowly rotating cores that can be well approximated by the cores of spherical stars. We also study the influence of the spin on the inspiral phase and the gravitational wave (GW) signal.

authors: Wolfgang Kastaun, Riccardo Ciolfi, Bruno Giacomazzo
topic: In this work, we study the merger of two neutron stars with a gravitational mass of 1.4 M_sol each, employing the Shen-Horowitz-Teige equation of state. This equation of state is a corner case, allowing the formation of a stable neutron star with the given total baryonic mass of 3.03 M_sol. We investigate in unprecedented detail the structure of the remnant, in particular the mass distribution, the thermal structure, and the rotation profile. We also compute fluid trajectories both inside the remnant and those relevant for the formation of the disk. We find a peanut-shaped fluid flow inside the remnant following a strong m=2 perturbation. Moreover, the flow is locally compressive, causing the appearance of dynamic hot spots. Further, we introduce new diagnostic measures that are easy to implement in numeric simulations and that allow to quantify mass and compactness of merger remnants in a well-defined way.

authors: F. Fraschetti
topic: We propose a qualitative scenario to interpret the argued association between the direct measurement of the gravitational wave event GW150914 by Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)-Virgo collaborations and the hard X-ray transient detected by Fermi-Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) 0.4 sec after. In a binary system of two gravitationally collapsing objects with a non-vanishing electric charge, the compenetration of the two magnetospheres occurring during the coalescence, through magnetic reconnection, produces a highly collimated relativistic outflow that becomes optically thin and shines in the GBM field of view. We propose that this process should be expected as a commonplace in the future joint gravitational/electromagnetic detections and, in case of neutron star-neutron star merger event, might lead to detectable X- or γ-ray precursors to, or transients associated with, the gravitational bursts.
