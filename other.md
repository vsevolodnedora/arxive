title: Galactic Traversability: A New Concept for Extragalactic SETI
authors: Brian C. Lacki
topic: Interstellar travel in the Milky Way is commonly thought to be a long and dangerous enterprise, but are all galaxies so hazardous? I introduce the concept of galactic traversability to address this question. Stellar populations are one factor in traversability, with higher stellar densities and velocity dispersions aiding rapid spread across a galaxy. The interstellar medium (ISM) is another factor, as gas, dust grains, and cosmic rays (CRs) all pose hazards to starfarers. I review the current understanding of these components in different types of galaxies, and conclude that red quiescent galaxies without star formation have favorable traversability. Compact elliptical galaxies and globular clusters could be "super-traversable", because stars are packed tightly together and there are minimal ISM hazards. Overall, if the ISM is the major hindrance to interstellar travel, galactic traversability increases with cosmic time as gas fractions and star formation decline. Traversability is a consideration in extragalactic surveys for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

title: Traversable wormholes in General Relativity without exotic matter
authors: R. A. Konoplya, A. Zhidenko
topic: In [J. Blazquez-Salcedo, C. Knoll, E. Radu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 126 (2021) no.10, 101102] asymptotically flat traversable wormhole solutions were obtained in the Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theory without using exotic matter. The normalizable numerical solutions found in \cite{Blazquez-Salcedo:2020czn} require a peculiar behavior at the throat: the mirror symmetry relatively the throat leads to the nonsmoothness of gravitational and matter fields. In particular, one must postulate the changing of the sign of the fermionic charge density at the throat requiring coexistence of particle and antiparticles without annihilation and posing a membrane of matter at the throat with specific properties. Apparently this kind of configurations could not exist in nature. We show that there are wormhole solutions, which are asymmetric relatively the throat and endowed by smooth gravitational and matter fields, being, thereby, free from all the above problems. This indicates that such wormhole configurations could also be supported in a realistic scenario.

title: Guest Editorial: Overview of the Special Issue and a Dialog on Starshades
authors: Jonathan Arenberg, Anthony Harness, Rebecca Jensen-Clem
topic: This special issue is dedicated to starshades: science, engineering, technology and programmatics. Our reasons for organizing this special issue are several fold. First as a new technology and with research accomplished in many institutions, recent results are widely scattered in the literature. As such, we see great value in co-locating many of the most recent results. This guest editorial summarizes the 19 contributed papers as the result of a special call for papers. Since this is a rapidly maturing technology, we wanted to co-locate a primer with the most current work in the field. It is hoped that this primer will provide a tutorial to the starshade concept and pathway to the literature not in this issue. In doing so, we hope to widen the starshade community in terms of engineering and scientific engagements. This tutorial takes the form of a dialog, where frequently asked questions are answered.

title: Which Stars can see Earth as a Transiting Exoplanet?
authors: L. Kaltenegger, J. Pepper
topic: Transit observations have found the majority of exoplanets to date. Spectroscopic observations of transits and eclipses are the most commonly used tool to characterize exoplanet atmospheres and will be used in the search for life. However, an exoplanet's orbit must be aligned with our line of sight to observe a transit. Here we ask, from which stellar vantage points would a distant observer be able to search for life on Earth in the same way?
We use the TESS Input Catalog and data from Gaia DR2 to identify the closest stars that could see Earth as a transiting exoplanet: We identify 1,004 Main Sequence stars within 100 parsecs, of which 508 guarantee a minimum 10-hour long observation of Earth's transit. Our star list consists of about 77% M-type, 12% K-type, 6% G-type, 4% F-type stars, and 1% A-type stars close to the ecliptic. SETI searches like the Breakthrough Listen Initiative are already focusing on this part of the sky. Our catalog now provides a target list for this search. As part of the extended mission, NASA's TESS will also search for transiting planets in the ecliptic to find planets that could detect life on our transiting Earth as well.

title: The Sun Diver: Combining solar sails with the Oberth effect
authors: Coryn A.L. Bailer-Jones 
topic: A highly reflective sail provides a way to propel a spacecraft out of the solar system using solar radiation pressure. The closer the spacecraft is to the Sun when it starts its outward journey, the larger the radiation pressure and so the larger the final velocity. For a spacecraft starting on the Earth's orbit, closer proximity can be achieved via a retrograde impulse from a rocket engine. The sail is then deployed at the closest approach to the Sun. Employing the so-called Oberth effect, a second, prograde, impulse at closest approach will raise the final velocity further. Here I investigate how a fixed total impulse ({\Delta}v) can best be distributed in this procedure to maximize the sail's velocity at infinity. Once {\Delta}v exceeds a threshold that depends on the lightness number of the sail (a measure of its sun-induced acceleration), the best strategy is to use all of the {\Delta}v in the retrograde impulse to dive as close as possible to the Sun. Below the threshold the best strategy is to use all of the {\Delta}v in the prograde impulse and thus not to dive at all. Although larger velocities can be achieved with multi-stage impulsive transfers, this study shows some interesting and perhaps counter-intuitive consequences of combining impulses with solar sails.

title: The Orbital Mechanics of Space Elevator Launch Systems
authors: Matthew M. Peet
topic: The construction of a space elevator would be an inspiring feat of planetary engineering of immense cost and risk. But would the benefit outweigh the costs and risks? What, precisely, is the purpose for building such a structure? For example, what if the space elevator could provide propellant-free (free release) orbital transfer to every planet in the solar system and beyond on a daily basis? In our view, this benefit might outweigh the costs and risks. But can a space elevator provide such a service? In this manuscript, we examine 3 tiers of space elevator launch system design and provide a detailed mathematical analysis of the orbital mechanics of spacecraft utilizing such designs. We find the limiting factor in all designs is the problem of transition to the ecliptic plane. For Tiers 1 and 2, we find that free release transfers to all the outer planets is possible, achieving velocities far beyond the ability of current Earth-based rocket technology, but with significant gaps in coverage due to planetary alignment. For Tier 3 elevators, however, we find that fast free release transfers to all planets in the solar system is possible on a daily basis. Finally, we show that Tier 2 and 3 space elevators can potentially use counterweights to perform staged slingshot maneuvers, providing a velocity multiplier which could dramatically reduce transit times to outer planets and interstellar destinations.

title: Solar One: A Proposal for The First Crewed Interstellar Spacecraft
authors: Alberto Caballero
topic: In this paper it is presented the concept and design of a new type of spacecraft that could be used to make the first manned interstellar travel. Solar one would integrate three near-term technologies, namely: the US Navy CFR fusion reactor, a larger version of NASA Sunjammer light sail, and an array of DE-STAR laser systems. A system of Fresnel lenses and flexible mirrors to propel the sail with sunlight is suggested as an alternative to this array. With a mile-long light sail, Solar One could reach an average of 22% the speed of light, arriving to the closest potentially habitable exoplanet in less than 19 years with the help of a Bussard scoop. Key challenges are reducing the weight of continuous-wave lasers and compact fusion reactors as well as achieving cryo-sleep and artificial gravity.
